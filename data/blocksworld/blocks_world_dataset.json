        "prompt_0shot": "Two agents are tasked with manipulating blocks arranged in stacks on a table, from one configuration to another. Each block is uniquely labelled by a letter. Both agents can only interact with blocks at the top of each stack, and only interact with one block at a time. Additionally, one agent can only interact with vowel blocks, and the other can only interact with consonant blocks. Initially there are blocks B, J, C, A, E, G, F, I, H, D. B is on the table, J is on the table, C is on top of J, A is on the table, E is on top of A, G is on top of C, F is on top of G, I is on the table, H is on top of I, D is on top of E. The goal is to have A is on top of B, B is on top of C, C is on top of D, D is on top of E, E is on top of F, F is on top of G, G is on top of H, H is on top of I, I is on top of J, J is on the table."
