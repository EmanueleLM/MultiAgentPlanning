The domain should define types for participant and slot, predicates such as available ?p ?s, chosen ?s, assigned ?p ?s, free ?s, and an action set that allows selecting a single slot and assigning all participants who are available at that slot. The problem should instantiate the participants and candidate 30-minute slots within 09:00-17:00 on Monday, assert available facts according to the three inputs, prefer slots before 12:00 if multiple are feasible by selecting the earliest feasible slot, and set a goal that all participants are assigned to the same chosen slot.",

Produce a single PDDL domain and a single PDDL problem targeting the Fast Downward solver; use only constructs supported by STRIPS or standard ADL as needed.
