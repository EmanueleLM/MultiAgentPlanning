If multiple slots exist, prefer the earliest chronologically; a single valid slot may also exist. 2) Emit a PDDL domain named meeting_schedule with requirements :strips and :typing. Include types person and slot; include domain constants arthur, michael, samantha of type person. Predicates: (available ?p - person ?s - slot), (chosen ?s - slot), (scheduled). Provide a single action choose_slot that selects ?s if all three participants are available for ?s and it is not already chosen; its effect sets (chosen ?s) and (scheduled). 3) Emit a PDDL problem named schedule_problem that declares slot objects for all candidate one-hour slots from 09:00-10:00 through 16:00-17:00 at 30-minute increments. In :init, assert (available arthur ?s), (available michael ?s), and (available samantha ?s) facts according to the computed availabilities from the inputs. Set the goal to (scheduled).
