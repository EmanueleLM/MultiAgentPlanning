Include predicates such as free(agent, window), within_work_hours(window), chosen(window), and scheduled. Provide an action schedule(window) that requires all participants free at that window and within_work_hours(window) and makes scheduled true and chosen(window) true. The initial state should mark all free(agent, window) relations that are true according to the inputs and within_work_hours for valid windows. The goal should be (scheduled).
