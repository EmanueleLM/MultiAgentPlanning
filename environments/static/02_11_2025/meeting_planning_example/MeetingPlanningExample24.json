Requirements: 1) Start at Nob Hill at 09:00. 2) Respect directed travel times: Nob Hill -> Presidio 17 minutes and Presidio -> Nob Hill 18 minutes. 3) Ensure meeting with Matthew occurs at Presidio within [11:00, 15:15] for at least 30 minutes. 4) Objective is to maximize the number of distinct friends met; with the given data, this means at least ensuring the Matthew meeting is feasible and scheduled. 5) Prefer shorter total makespan when ties occur. Provide a domain with actions such as move, wait, and meet(friend, location, duration>=min_meeting). Provide a problem with objects for locations, the friend, time discretized in minutes, initial facts for current time and location, the minimum meeting duration, and availability window predicates for Matthew. Encode constraints so the solver can produce at least one valid plan and the goal captures maximizing friends met; if optimization is not directly expressible, encode a goal that ensures meeting Matthew for at least the minimum duration and include helpful metrics (e.g., minimize total time) compatible with FastDownwards. Enclose the domain in <domain></domain> and the problem in <problem></problem>."
