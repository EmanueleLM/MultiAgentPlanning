The domain must represent blocks, table, on relations, clear(top) relations, and agent-specific action predicates or typed actions so the two agents' move capabilities remain distinct. The produced PDDL must be compatible with FastDownwards. Enclose the PDDL domain between <domain></domain> tags and the PDDL problem between <problem></problem> tags. Keep agent actions distinct and preserve constraints reported by agents. If information is missing, do not invent unreachable facts; document assumptions and keep them minimal.",
