Produce a domain and a problem suitable for FastDownward (PDDL 2.1 compatible). Enclose the PDDL domain between <domain> and </domain> tags and the PDDL problem between <problem> and </problem> tags. Keep the actions of the two agents distinct by naming them appropriately (for example move-vowel and move-consonant or by adding an agent parameter), and ensure the domain encodes that vowel_agent may only move vowels and consonant_agent may only move consonants and that moves operate only on top blocks and move one block at a time.",

Here is the partial plan reported by the vowel agent: {plan_vowel}. Here is the partial plan reported by the consonant agent: {plan_consonant}.
