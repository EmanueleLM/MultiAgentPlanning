A partial PDDL may partially solve a planning problem but may require integrating information from the other PDDL to achieve the goal. Ambiguities may appear for example if different agents name the same object differently. Here is the information the first agent has and its PDDL response: {pddl_vowel_agent} Here is the information the second agent has and its PDDL response: {pddl_consonant_agent} You need to integrate the PDDL responses of the two agents to solve the task. It is important that you keep the actions of the two agents distinct.
