Keep each agent's actions distinct (for example, travel actions for different agents must be clearly labeled). If the city proposals conflict with the global constraints (total days = 11, direct-flight-only connectivity, and wedding attendance), resolve the conflicts so the final plan satisfies all global constraints.
