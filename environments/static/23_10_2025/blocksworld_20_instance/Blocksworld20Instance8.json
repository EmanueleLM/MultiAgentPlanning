Here are the reports from the agents to integrate: {report_robot_alpha} {report_robot_beta} Use these to resolve any ambiguities and ensure the final PDDL initial state matches the true initial arrangement and the problem's goal corresponds to the derived final arrangement. Keep agent actions distinct in your reasoning but produce a single domain and problem that represent the final outcome.
