Produce a PDDL domain and a PDDL problem that model the initial state and that encode the given action sequence as deterministic actions or as a plan goal so the planner can verify and produce the final arrangement. Enclose the PDDL domain between <domain></domain> tags and the PDDL problem between <problem></problem> tags. Keep agents' roles distinct if modeling multiple actors. Also include, as a short human-readable comment before the PDDL output, the derived final arrangement of every block (state whether each block is on the table or on top of another block).",

Enclose the PDDL domain between <domain></domain> tags and the PDDL problem between <problem></problem> tags. The inputs you receive are: report_mover1 and report_mover2. The global task is to determine the final positions of blocks A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H after the provided 30 actions and to provide the PDDL domain and problem that reflect this instance."
