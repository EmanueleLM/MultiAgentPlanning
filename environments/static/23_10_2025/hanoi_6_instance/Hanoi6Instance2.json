Enclose the PDDL domain between <domain> and </domain> tags and the PDDL problem between <problem> and </problem> tags. Ensure the domain uses classical PDDL constructs supported by FastDownwards (STRIPS-style actions), models moving only top disks, and enforces the rule that larger disks cannot be placed on smaller ones. Keep agent roles distinct if you model per-peg actions, and ensure the produced PDDL is syntactically correct.",

Target the PDDL to be compatible with the FastDownwards solver. Enclose the PDDL domain between <domain></domain> and the PDDL problem between <problem></problem>.
