If conflicts or illegal moves are present, adjust or request clarification conceptually by resolving them yourself where possible (do not invent new agent permissions). 3) Produce a PDDL domain and a PDDL problem that models the 3 pegs, the 10 disks, and two agents with distinct move actions; ensure the domain/problem are compatible with FastDownward.
