Enclose the PDDL domain between <domain></domain> tags and the PDDL problem between <problem></problem> tags. Keep actions distinct per agent (e.g., agent_1_move, agent_2_move) so the multi-agent nature is explicit. Target the FastDownward planner in domain/problem style and ensure the representation models disks, pegs, disk-size ordering, allowed moves, and agent permissions.
