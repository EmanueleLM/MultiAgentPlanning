Ensure the domain encodes pegs, disks, size ordering, legal move preconditions (top disk, no larger-on-smaller), and effects. Ensure the problem encodes the initial arrangement and the goal arrangement exactly as given in the public information. Enclose the PDDL domain between <domain></domain> tags and the PDDL problem between <problem></problem> tags. If the agents' plans conflict or are partial, resolve ambiguities explicitly and produce a correct PDDL pair that FastDownwards can accept.
