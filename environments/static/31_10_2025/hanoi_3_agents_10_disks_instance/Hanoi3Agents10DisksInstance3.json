Enforce legality constraints: one disk moved at a time, cannot place larger disk on smaller disk, and only allowed agents move their permitted disks. If you detect conflicts or illegal moves in the agents' proposals, resolve them by adjusting ordering while preserving legality and agent permissions. Output a PDDL domain enclosed between <domain></domain> tags and a PDDL problem enclosed between <problem></problem> tags. The PDDL should represent pegs left middle right, disks A..J with appropriate size ordering, agent-specific move actions, and a goal encoding the required final configuration: left peg top-to-bottom D E F G H I J, middle peg top-to-bottom A, right peg top-to-bottom B C."
