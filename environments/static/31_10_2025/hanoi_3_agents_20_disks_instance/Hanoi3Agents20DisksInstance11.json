The PDDL must be suitable for the FastDownward planner. Enclose the PDDL domain between <domain></domain> tags and the PDDL problem between <problem></problem> tags. Keep the actions of the three moving agents distinct in the PDDL by prefixing action names or using agent-specific predicates. If conflicts or illegal moves are present in the proposals, correct them only to the extent necessary to produce a legal plan, and document those corrections in comments inside the PDDL problem as plain text above the problem tag.
