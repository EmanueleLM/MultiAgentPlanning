Enclose the PDDL domain between <domain></domain> tags and the PDDL problem between <problem></problem> tags. Keep actions of distinct agents clearly separated (for example, action names prefixed by agent_1-, agent_2-, agent_3-). Ensure the domain encodes pegs, disks with proper size ordering, and agent-specific capabilities. Ensure the problem encodes the initial and goal configurations exactly as given in the public information. The PDDL should be fully specified for FastDownwards and should not rely on missing assumptions; if an agent's move list is partial, infer minimally needed additional constraints but do not invent moves for disks outside any agent's permission. Provide the domain and problem only; do not output the move list again."
