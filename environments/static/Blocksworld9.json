Ambiguities may appear in different forms: for example, two PDDL problems may refer to the same object with different names. Here is the information the first agent has and its PDDL response: {pddl_vowel_agent} Here is the information the second agent has and its PDDL response: {pddl_consonant_agent} You need to integrate the PDDL responses of the two agents to solve the task. It is important that you keep the actions of the two agents distinct.
