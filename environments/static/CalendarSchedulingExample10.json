A partial PDDL may partially solve a planning problem, but it may require integrating additional information from the other PDDL responses to achieve the goal. Ambiguities may appear in different forms, such as two PDDL problems referring to the same time slot with different names. Here is the information the first agent has and its PDDL response: {pddl_diana} Here is the information the second agent has and its PDDL response: {pddl_ethan} Here is the information the third agent has and its PDDL response: {pddl_janet} You need to integrate the PDDL responses of the three agents to produce a combined PDDL domain and a PDDL problem file that FastDownwards can solve.
