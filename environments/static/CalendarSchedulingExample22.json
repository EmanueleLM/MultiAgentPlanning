Ambiguities may appear for example when different agents refer to the same time slot with different names. Here is the information the first agent has and its PDDL response: {pddl_theresa} Here is the information the second agent has and its PDDL response: {pddl_charles} Here is the information the third agent has and its PDDL response: {pddl_betty} You need to integrate the PDDL responses of the three agents to solve the task.
