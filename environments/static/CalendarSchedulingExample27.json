A partial PDDL may partially solve a planning problem, but it may require integrating additional information from the other PDDL outputs to achieve the goal. Ambiguities may appear in different forms for example two PDDL problems may refer to the same time slot with different names. Here is the information the first agent has and its PDDL response: {pddl_jesse} Here is the information the second agent has and its PDDL response: {pddl_kathryn} Here is the information the third agent has and its PDDL response: {pddl_megan} You need to integrate the PDDL responses of the three agents to produce a joint PDDL domain and PDDL problem that schedules a single 30 minute meeting on Monday between 09:00 and 17:00 at the earliest available slot that fits all participants. It is important that you keep the agents distinct in the integrated model. Think step by step and provide a PDDL domain and a PDDL problem file targeted to FastDownward.
