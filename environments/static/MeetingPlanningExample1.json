A partial PDDL may partially solve a planning problem, but it may require integrating additional information from the other PDDL to achieve the goal. Ambiguities may appear in different forms for example two PDDL problems may refer to the same object with different names. Here is the information the first agent has and its PDDL response: {pddl_you} Here is the information the second agent has and its PDDL response: {pddl_betty} You need to integrate the PDDL responses of the two agents to solve the task.
