A partial PDDL may partially solve a planning problem but may require integration of additional information from the other PDDL to achieve the goal. Ambiguities may appear in different forms such as referring to the same place with different names. Here is the information the first agent has and its PDDL response: {pddl_visitor} Here is the information the second agent has and its PDDL response: {pddl_james} You need to integrate the PDDL responses of the two agents to solve the task and produce a combined PDDL domain and problem for FastDownward. It is important that you keep the actions of the two agents distinct. Think step by step and provide a PDDL domain and a PDDL problem file to solve the task.
