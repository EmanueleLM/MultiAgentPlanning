Ambiguities may appear in different forms such as naming differences for the same object. Here is the information the first agent has and its PDDL response: {pddl_visitor} Here is the information the second agent has and its PDDL response: {pddl_andrew} You need to integrate the PDDL responses of the two agents to solve the task.
