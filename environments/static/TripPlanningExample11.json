A partial PDDL may partially solve a planning problem but may require integration of additional information from the other PDDL to achieve the goal. Ambiguities may appear in different forms such as different names for the same object. Here is the information the first agent has and its PDDL response: {pddl_traveler} Here is the information the second agent has and its PDDL response: {pddl_flight_network} You need to integrate the PDDL responses of the two agents to solve the task. It is important that you keep the actions of the two agents distinct.
