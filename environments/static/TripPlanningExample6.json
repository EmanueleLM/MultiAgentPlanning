A partial PDDL may partially solve a planning problem, but it may require integrating additional information from the other PDDL files to achieve the goal. Ambiguities may appear in different forms for example different names for the same city or different durations. Here is the information the first agent has and its PDDL response: {pddl_dubrovnik} Here is the information the second agent has and its PDDL response: {pddl_berlin} Here is the information the third agent has and its PDDL response: {pddl_munich} You need to integrate the PDDL responses of the three agents to produce a single PDDL domain and a single PDDL problem file that yields a feasible 8 day trip plan using only direct flights and attending the Berlin conference on day 1 and day 4. It is important that you keep the actions of the three agents distinct in the combined domain. If the agents' desired day allocations exceed the total available days, propose a reconciled allocation that fits the 8 day constraint.
