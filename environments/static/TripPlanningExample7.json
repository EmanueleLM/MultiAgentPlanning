A partial PDDL may partially solve a planning problem, but it may require integrating additional information from the other PDDL to achieve the goal. Ambiguities may appear in different forms: for example, two PDDL problems may refer to the same object with different names. Here is the information the first agent has and its PDDL response: {pddl_traveler} Here is the information the second agent has and its PDDL response: {pddl_flight_checker} You need to integrate the PDDL responses of the two agents to solve the task. It is very important that you keep the actions of the two agents distinct.
