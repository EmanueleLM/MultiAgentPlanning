You have to orchestrate them to solve the following task: Create a schedule visiting Krakow, Athens, and Zurich for a total of 16 days using only direct flights and respecting individual stay durations and constraints. Keep in mind that the PDDL they send you may be partial or contain ambiguities. A partial PDDL may partially solve a planning problem and may require integration of additional information from the other PDDL files. Ambiguities may appear when agents refer to the same object with different names or when durations must be combined. Here is the information the first agent has and its PDDL response: pddl_krakow_agent. Here is the information the second agent has and its PDDL response: pddl_athens_agent. Here is the information the third agent has and its PDDL response: pddl_zurich_agent. You need to integrate the PDDL responses of the three agents to produce a combined PDDL domain and a PDDL problem file compatible with the FastDownward solver. It is important that you keep the actions of each agent distinct. Think step by step and provide a PDDL domain and a PDDL problem file that schedule stays that sum to 16 days, use only direct flights, respect 6 days in Krakow, 7 days in Athens with relatives visited between day 1 and day 7, and 5 days in Zurich.
