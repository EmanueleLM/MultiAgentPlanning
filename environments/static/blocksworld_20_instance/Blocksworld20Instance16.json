Enclose the PDDL domain between <domain></domain> tags and the PDDL problem between <problem></problem> tags. If any ambiguity arises from the agent sequences, resolve it by following the action order provided in the public information. The domain should include predicates for on, ontable, clear, holding, and handempty, and actions such as unstack and stack.
