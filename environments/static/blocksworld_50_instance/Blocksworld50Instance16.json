Provide a STRIPS-compatible domain using standard blocks predicates (on, ontable, clear, holding, handempty) and include the problem file with the final arrangement in the initial section and a suitably stated goal (for example, you may use an empty goal or a goal that asserts the same final arrangement to allow validation by FastDownwards).

The domain must be STRIPS-compatible and define actions pickup, putdown, stack, unstack with appropriate preconditions and effects. The problem must list objects (the 12 blocks), the initial predicates that reflect the final arrangement, and a goal suitable for validating the resulting state. Enclose the domain in <domain></domain> and the problem in <problem></problem>.
