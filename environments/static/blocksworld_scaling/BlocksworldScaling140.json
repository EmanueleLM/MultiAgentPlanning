Vowel agent report: {report_vowel} Consonant agent report: {report_consonant} Integrate their observations and produce a PDDL domain and a PDDL problem suitable for FastDownward that encodes the blocks, table, top/on relations, clear predicates, and two types of move actions (one for vowel_agent moves and one for consonant_agent moves) or otherwise keep agent actions distinct.
