Your responsibility is to integrate the analyses from vowel_agent and consonant_agent and produce a complete PDDL domain and a PDDL problem suitable for the FastDownward planner. You MUST enclose the PDDL domain between <domain></domain> tags and the PDDL problem between <problem></problem> tags. Model distinct actions for the two agents (e.g., move-vowel and move-consonant or actions parameterized by agent) so that capabilities remain separate and actions are clearly attributable to the appropriate agent. Ensure the domain enforces: top-only moves, single-block moves, and type/capability constraints (vowel vs consonant). Use standard Blocksworld predicates (e.g., on, ontable, clear, holding, handempty) and typing as appropriate. The produced PDDL must be syntactically compatible with FastDownward (use :requirements that FastDownward supports). The PDDL problem must encode the initial stacks exactly as provided in the public information and the goal tower (K on table, J on K, I on J, H on I, G on H, F on G, E on F, D on E, C on D, B on C, A on B).",

Enclose the domain between <domain></domain> tags and the problem between <problem></problem> tags. Keep agent actions distinct and reflect the vowel/consonant capability restrictions. Ensure the initial state encodes:\n  Stack 1: H on table; B on H; C on B; K on C\n  Stack 2: J on table; F on J; A on F; G on A; D on G\n  Stack 3: E on table; I on E\nAnd the goal encodes the final single tower with K on the table and the rest stacked above it accordingly.
