Use predicates and actions appropriate for standard blocksworld with one-block-at-a-time moves and top-of-stack constraints. Enclose the PDDL domain between <domain> and </domain> tags and the PDDL problem between <problem> and </problem> tags.

Here is the analysis output from the vowel agent: {analysis_vowel}. Here is the analysis output from the consonant agent: {analysis_consonant}. Integrate these inputs and produce a PDDL domain and a PDDL problem targeted for FastDownwards that solves the global goal.
