A partial PDDL may partially solve a planning problem but may require integrating additional information from the other PDDL files. Ambiguities may appear in different forms for example two PDDL problems may refer to the same time slot with different names. Here is the information the first agent has and its PDDL response: {pddl_Alexander} Here is the information the second agent has and its PDDL response: {pddl_Elizabeth} Here is the information the third agent has and its PDDL response: {pddl_Walter} You need to integrate the PDDL responses of the three agents to produce a single PDDL domain and PDDL problem file that the FastDownward PDDL solver can use to find a 30 minute meeting time that satisfies all participants. It is very important that you keep the actions and constraints of each participant distinct. Think step by step and provide a PDDL domain and a PDDL problem file.
