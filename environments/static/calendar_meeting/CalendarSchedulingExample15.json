A partial PDDL may partially describe availability and may require integration. Ambiguities may appear if agents name the same time slot differently. Here is the information the first agent has and its PDDL response: {pddl_joyce} Here is the information the second agent has and its PDDL response: {pddl_christine} Here is the information the third agent has and its PDDL response: {pddl_alexander} You need to integrate the PDDL responses of the three agents to find a common 30 minute slot that respects all constraints. It is important that you keep the actions and predicates of the three agents distinct or clearly reconciled.
