A partial PDDL may partially solve a planning problem but may require integration of additional information from other PDDL files. Ambiguities may appear in different forms for example two PDDL problems may refer to the same time slot with different names. Here is the information the first agent has and its PDDL response: {pddl_Ralph} Here is the information the second agent has and its PDDL response: {pddl_Peter} Here is the information the third agent has and its PDDL response: {pddl_Daniel} You need to integrate the PDDL responses to produce a final PDDL domain and problem that finds a meeting time compatible with all participants. It is really important that you keep the actions or predicates that belong to each participant distinct. Think step by step and provide a PDDL domain and a PDDL problem file targeting FastDownward.
