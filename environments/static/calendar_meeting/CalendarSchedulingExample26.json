Your task is to integrate them into a single consistent PDDL domain and PDDL problem that schedules a one-hour meeting on Monday between 09:00 and 17:00 compatible with all participants' calendars. Keep in mind that the PDDL they send you may be partial or contain ambiguities. A partial PDDL may partially solve a planning problem, but it may require integrating additional information from the other PDDL to achieve the goal. Ambiguities may appear for example when two agents refer to the same time slot with different names. Here is the information the first agent has and its PDDL response: {pddl_Katherine} Here is the information the second agent has and its PDDL response: {pddl_Nicole} Here is the information the third agent has and its PDDL response: {pddl_Kevin} You need to integrate the PDDL responses of the three agents to solve the task. It is important that you keep the actions and resources of the agents distinct in the combined PDDL so the orchestrator can map scheduled time slots to participants. Think step by step and provide a PDDL domain and a PDDL problem file that can be solved with FastDownward. Enclose the pddl domain between <domain></domain> tags and the pddl problem between <problem></problem> tags."
