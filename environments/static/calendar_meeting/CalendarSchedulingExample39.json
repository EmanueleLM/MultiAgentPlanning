A partial PDDL may partially solve a planning problem but may require integrating additional information from the other PDDL to achieve the goal. Ambiguities may appear in different forms for example two PDDL problems may refer to the same time slot or same resource with different names.

It is important that you keep the actions of the agents distinct and that the final PDDL is compatible with the FastDownward PDDL solver.
