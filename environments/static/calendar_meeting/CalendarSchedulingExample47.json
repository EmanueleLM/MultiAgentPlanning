Keep in mind the PDDL they send you may be partial or contain ambiguities. A partial PDDL may partially solve a planning problem but may require integrating additional information from other PDDL to achieve the goal. Ambiguities may appear in different forms for example two PDDL problems may refer to the same time slot with different names. Here is the information the first agent has and its PDDL response: {pddl_Alice} Here is the information the second agent has and its PDDL response: {pddl_Daniel} Here is the information the third agent has and its PDDL response: {pddl_Scott} Here is the information the fourth agent has and its PDDL response: {pddl_Lori} Here is the information the fifth agent has and its PDDL response: {pddl_Cynthia} Here is the information the sixth agent has and its PDDL response: {pddl_Jeffrey} Here is the information the seventh agent has and its PDDL response: {pddl_Hannah} You need to integrate the PDDL responses of all agents to solve the task. It is important that you keep the actions of the agents distinct.
