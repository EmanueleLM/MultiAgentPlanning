Each robot can move in four directions (up, down, right, left), change the color of paint it is carrying, and paint adjacent tiles. The domain also tracks the total cost of actions performed.",
            "Natural Language Problem Description: You control a set of robots that can paint floor tiles with different colors. The robots can move in four directions: up, down, left, and right. They can paint with one color at a time and can change the color of their spray guns. Tiles can only be painted in the front (up) or behind (down) the robot, and once a tile is painted, no robot can stand on it. Robot1 is at tile_4-1 (white paint). Robot2 is at tile_4-3 (black paint). Goal is to paint specific tiles with specific alternating black/white patterns, minimizing cost.",
