Effect: package is in the vehicle, package is not at the location.\n- Unload (package, vehicle, location): Package must be in the vehicle, vehicle must be at the location. Effect: package is at the location, package is not in the vehicle.\n- Drive (truck, from_loc, to_loc, city): Truck must be at from_loc. Both locations must be in the same city. Effect: truck moves from from_loc to to_loc.\n- Fly (airplane, from_loc, to_loc): Airplane must be at from_loc. Both locations must be designated airports. Effect: airplane moves from from_loc to to_loc.\n\nInitial State:\n- Airports: location_0_0 and location_1_0.\n- City Structure: location_0_0 and location_0_1 are in city_0. location_1_0 and location_1_1 are in city_1.\n- Initial Positions: airplane_0 at location_1_0; package_0 at location_1_0; truck_0 at location_0_0; truck_1 at location_1_0.\n\nGlobal Goal: package_0 is at location_1_1.\n\nBased on these details, construct the appropriate PDDL domain and PDDL problem to find a plan.
