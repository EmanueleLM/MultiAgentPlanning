Robots must have a color to paint, painting makes a tile no longer clear and tiles once painted cannot be occupied by robots.",

Goal: paint a specified checkerboard pattern for tiles tile_1-1 through tile_4-4 with white/black assignments. Minimize total-cost. The grid is 4x4 with tiles named tile_0-1 through tile_4-4.",
