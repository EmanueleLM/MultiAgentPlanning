Provide any auxiliary predicates you require and justify them. Think step by step and be explicit about how the fragment enforces the rule that only the smaller disk may be placed on a larger disk."

Enclose the PDDL domain between <domain></domain> tags and the PDDL problem between <problem></problem> tags.
