Keep the action definitions unambiguous, use STRIPS or a FastDownwards-compatible ADL subset, and ensure the initial state and goal match the validated sequence and the public information. Enclose the PDDL domain between <domain></domain> tags and the PDDL problem between <problem></problem> tags. If input sequences contain differing object names, reconcile them consistently. Keep agents and their roles documented but ensure the produced PDDL is a single-agent planning instance suitable for FastDownwards."
