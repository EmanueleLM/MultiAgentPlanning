The problem should declare objects for disks A through G and pegs left, middle, right, set the initial on-stack relations reflecting all disks stacked on left from top A to bottom G, and set the goal to the equivalent stack on right with left and middle empty. Output two sections clearly labeled as domain and problem. The produced PDDL will be consumed by FastDownward, so avoid nonstandard extensions."
