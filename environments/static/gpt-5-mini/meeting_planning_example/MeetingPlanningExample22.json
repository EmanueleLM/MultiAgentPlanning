The initial state must reflect arrival at Presidio at 09:00. Andrew must be at Union Square only during 11:15 to 17:15 and the plan must include a meeting at Union Square with duration at least 105 minutes. Keep actions of different agents distinct where relevant. Enclose the PDDL domain between <domain></domain> tags and the PDDL problem between <problem></problem> tags. Target FastDownwards with temporal constructs where necessary and include comments explaining key modeling choices."
