The domain must represent pegs, disks, sizes, and a move action that moves a single top disk from one peg to another while preventing placing larger disks on smaller ones. Keep the model compatible with classical FastDownwards (avoid nonstandard extensions). Enclose the PDDL domain between <domain></domain> tags and the PDDL problem between <problem></problem> tags.
