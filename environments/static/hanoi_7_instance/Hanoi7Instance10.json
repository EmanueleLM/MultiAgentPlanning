Your domain must model pegs and disks, enforce that only one disk moves at a time, and forbid placing larger disks on smaller disks. Use explicit predicates for disk sizes or ordering as needed. Enclose the domain between <domain></domain> tags and the problem between <problem></problem> tags. Keep the actions distinct and include comments or a brief metadata line indicating compatibility with FastDownward."
