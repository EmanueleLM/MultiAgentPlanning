Use only constructs supported by FastDownwards classical STRIPS and ADL features if necessary. Explicitly model pegs disks top relation and legal move preconditions and effects so that the planner cannot bypass rules with bookkeeping tokens. Enclose the PDDL domain between <domain></domain> tags and the PDDL problem between <problem></problem> tags. Make sure the domain and problem reflect the validated sequence if relevant and are self contained and executable by FastDownwards."
