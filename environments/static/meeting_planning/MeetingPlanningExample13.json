You have to integrate and orchestrate them to solve the following task:{agents->orchestrator->goal} Keep in mind that the PDDL they send you may be partial or contain ambiguities. A partial PDDL may partially solve a planning problem but may require integration from the other PDDL to achieve the goal. Ambiguities may include different names for the same object or missing timing constraints. Here is the information the first agent has and its PDDL response:{pddl_you} Here is the information the second agent has and its PDDL response:{pddl_betty} You need to integrate the PDDL responses of the two agents to produce a single coherent FastDownward-compatible PDDL domain and problem that maximizes meetings and ensures Betty is met for at least 75 minutes given travel times and availability. It is important that you keep actions of the two agents distinct and that you explicitly model travel durations and availability windows. Think step by step and provide a PDDL domain and a PDDL problem file. Enclose the PDDL domain between <domain></domain> tags and the PDDL problem between <problem></problem> tags."
