A partial PDDL may partially solve a planning problem, but it may require integration from the other PDDL to achieve the goal. Ambiguities may appear in different forms such as different names for the same object. Here is the information the first agent has and its PDDL response: {pddl_visitor} Here is the information the second agent has and its PDDL response: {pddl_john} You need to integrate the PDDL responses of the two agents to solve the task. It is important that you keep the actions of the two agents distinct and produce a combined PDDL domain and problem that target the FastDownwards PDDL solver. Think step by step and provide a PDDL domain and a PDDL problem file that models combined schedules, travel actions, and the constraint that the meeting with John must last at least 45 minutes.
