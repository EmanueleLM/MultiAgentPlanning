A partial PDDL may partially solve a planning problem but it may require integration of additional information from the other PDDL to achieve the goal. Ambiguities may appear when agents name the same object differently. Here is the information the first agent has and its PDDL response: {pddl_visitor} Here is the information the second agent has and its PDDL response: {pddl_jessica} You need to integrate the PDDL responses of the two agents to produce a combined PDDL domain and problem suitable for FastDownward.
