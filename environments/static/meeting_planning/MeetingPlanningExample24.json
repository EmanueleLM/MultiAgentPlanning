You have to orchestrate them to solve the following task: {agents->orchestrator->goal} Keep in mind that the PDDL they send you may be partial or contain ambiguities. A partial PDDL may partially solve a planning problem but may require integration of additional information from the other PDDL to achieve the goal. Ambiguities may appear in different forms for example two PDDL problems may refer to the same object with different names. Here is the information the first agent has and its PDDL response: {pddl_you} Here is the information the second agent has and its PDDL response: {pddl_matthew} You need to integrate the PDDL responses of the two agents to solve the task. It is important that you keep the actions of the two agents distinct. Think step by step and provide a PDDL domain and a PDDL problem file that models both agents travel times availability windows and a meeting of at least 30 minutes at the Presidio within Matthew availability.
