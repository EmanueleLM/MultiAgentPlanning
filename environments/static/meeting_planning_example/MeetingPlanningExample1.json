Produce a classical PDDL domain and problem compatible with FastDownward (no durative actions). Represent time using discrete 5-minute ticks from 09:00 to 21:45 (create time objects and a successor predicate, and use actions that advance time accordingly). Include actions move(from,to,t_start,t_end) that require adjacency via the directed edges and t_end being the appropriate successor reached after the travel duration, and meet(person,location,t_start,t_end) that requires being at location throughout the interval and advances time by the meeting duration. Encode minimum durations by chaining over successive 5-minute ticks. The goal must require meeting Betty for at least 60 minutes and optionally encode meeting as many other distinct friends as possible; if necessary, choose and hard-code the best schedule identified from the inputs.
