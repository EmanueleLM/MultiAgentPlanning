Keep actions for different agents distinct. Output the PDDL domain between <domain> and </domain> tags and the PDDL problem between <problem> and </problem> tags.

Use the public environment information, travel times, the traveler's candidate schedules, and Ronald's availability to produce a unified PDDL domain and PDDL problem solvable by FastDownward. Encode time discretely in minutes or a suitable discretization, include travel and meet actions, enforce Ronald's minimum meeting duration of 105 minutes, and include a metric to maximize number of distinct friends met. If candidate schedules conflict or lack detail, reconcile them conservatively and document assumptions. Provide the final PDDL domain and problem."
