Initialize t to 540 (09:00) and the agent at alamo_square. Provide actions: move_as_to_sd increasing t by 16 and moving from alamo_square to sunset_district, move_sd_to_as increasing t by 17 and moving back, an optional wait action that increases t by a fixed positive integer constant, and meet_matthew that requires being at sunset_district with preconditions 810 <= t <= 855 and increases t by 15 while setting a predicate met_matthew true. Assign action costs equal to the time increase and include a metric to minimize total-cost. Set the goal to met_matthew."
