Keep agent actions distinct where relevant. Enclose the PDDL domain between <domain></domain> tags and the PDDL problem between <problem></problem> tags.

Ensure the required minimum 30 minute meeting with Margaret at Haight-Ashbury within her window. Keep the domain and problem clearly delimited by <domain></domain> and <problem></problem>.
