Integrate these inputs and produce a PDDL domain and a PDDL problem that encode locations, travel durations, time progression or temporal constraints appropriate for FastDownwards, and an objective that maximizes the number of friends met while enforcing a meeting with Thomas of at least 105 minutes during his availability window. Use the following sources of information: environment public information: {environment->public_information} traveler proposals: {traveler_options} Thomas availability and constraints: {thomas_options} Think step by step and produce a complete PDDL domain and problem.
