Enumerate several distinct feasible day plans starting at Chinatown at 09:00 that include a meeting with Stephanie at Marina District for at least 105 minutes, incorporating the directed travel times exactly as given and not assuming any missing distances. For each plan option, specify: sequence of activities with timestamps, locations, travel legs with durations and directions, exact meeting window with Stephanie and its length, and a count of total distinct friend meetings. If data is missing for other friends or travel times, note the limitation and prioritize robust options that at minimum secure Stephanie's 105-minute meeting.

You keep actions and objects interpretable, and you avoid unsupported features. Where durations are needed, either discretize time into minutes or encode time steps so that FastDownwards can solve the problem as a classical planning instance.

Requirements: include objects for locations (at least Chinatown and MarinaDistrict), agents or roles as needed, actions for travel with direction-specific applicability, actions for meet_stephanie subject to availability and a minimum of 105 minutes represented via discretized time steps or equivalent modeling. Encode initial state as starting at Chinatown at 09:00, incorporate known travel times only, and avoid assuming any other travel edges. Optimize for maximum meetings while guaranteeing the Stephanie constraint; if multiple candidate schedules exist, choose the best feasible one and reflect it in the initial goals or metric.
