The PDDL must model time in 30-minute discrete steps consistent with the environment granularity and include a cost or tie-breaking mechanism to minimize interruption to Bob's morning schedule.

The PDDL should find the earliest feasible 30-minute slot when all are available and, among multiple feasible earliest slots, prefer the one that least interferes with Bob's morning schedule. Do not assume missing intervals. If inputs are partial, explain the assumptions in comments in the PDDL problem file before the problem definition."
