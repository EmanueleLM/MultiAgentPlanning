You have to orchestrate them to solve the following task: {agents->orchestrator->goal}. Keep in mind that the PDDL they send you may be partial or contain ambiguities. A partial PDDL may partially solve a planning problem, but it may require integrating additional information from the other PDDL to achieve the goal. Ambiguities may appear in different forms for example two PDDL problems may refer to the same object with different names. Here is the information the first agent has and its PDDL response: {pddl_amsterdam}. Here is the information the second agent has and its PDDL response: {pddl_santorini}. Here is the information the third agent has and its PDDL response: {pddl_istanbul}. You need to integrate the PDDL responses of the three agents to solve the task. It is very important that you keep the actions of the three agents distinct. Additionally, reconcile any conflicts so that the final integrated plan fits exactly 14 total days and uses only direct flights. If necessary, adjust agents' suggested stays to achieve a consistent feasible plan while respecting hard constraints such as the Santorini relatives visit between day 12 and day 14 and the available direct flights. Think step by step and provide a PDDL domain and a PDDL problem file targeting the FastDownwards solver. Enclose the pddl domain between <domain></domain> tags, and the pddl problem between <problem></problem> tags."
