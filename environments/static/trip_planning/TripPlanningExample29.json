A partial PDDL may partially solve a planning problem, but it may require integrating additional information from the other PDDL to achieve the goal. Ambiguities may appear in different forms: for example, two PDDL problems may refer to the same city with different names. Here is the information the agents have and their PDDL responses: {pddl_krakow} {pddl_dubrovnik} {pddl_frankfurt} You need to integrate the PDDL responses of the three agents to produce a single PDDL domain and problem that satisfy the global constraints: total days equal to 10, travel only by direct flights as given in public information, schedule the wedding in Krakow around day 9 to day 10, and respect agents preferences when possible. If agents preferences conflict with the total days constraint, produce a feasible plan that respects the total days constraint and explains tradeoffs in comments in the PDDL problem as PDDL comments. Keep actions of the three agents distinct. Provide a PDDL domain and a PDDL problem file. Enclose the domain between <domain></domain> and the problem between <problem></problem>."
