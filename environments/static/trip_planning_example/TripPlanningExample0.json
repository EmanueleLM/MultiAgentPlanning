Direct flights exist between Barcelona and Florence, and between Helsinki and Barcelona; there is no direct flight between Florence and Helsinki. Now integrate the agents' preference outputs and resolve conflicts if the sum of requested days exceeds the 14-day horizon. Produce a PDDL domain and a PDDL problem that represent days as a discrete horizon from day 1 to day 14, represent flight actions only where direct flights exist, represent stay actions for each city with durations in days, and encode the meeting constraint that the traveler must be in Florence on some day in the interval day 9 to day 14. If exact desires cannot all be satisfied, choose a feasible allocation that maximizes satisfaction of requested stays while ensuring feasibility under direct-flight connectivity. Keep the travel and stay actions distinct and name them clearly by city. Target the FastDownwards solver and include any necessary numeric or temporal encodings appropriate for FastDownwards simple finite-horizon planning. Enclose the domain in <domain></domain> and the problem in <problem></problem>."
