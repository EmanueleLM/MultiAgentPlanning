Reconcile any conflicts (for example total desired days exceeding 13) by respecting hard constraints first (such as the Florence workshop between day 1 and day 4) and proposing minimal, explicit adjustments for negotiable desires. Only direct flights are allowed and the available connections are Florence-Amsterdam and Amsterdam-Riga. Produce a PDDL domain and PDDL problem that encode the travel plan search for a 13-day itinerary, using explicit actions for staying days in a city and for taking direct flights. Enclose the domain in <domain></domain> and the problem in <problem></problem>. The PDDL should be suitable to run with FastDownward."
