Combine the agents\\' PDDLs coherently to respect all constraints. Think step by step and provide a PDDL domain and problem that encapsulate the integrated model. Do not make assumptions beyond the given information. Keep in mind that the PDDL files you receive may be partial or contain ambiguities.\"\\n            }\\n        },\\n        \"order_constraints\": [\\n            \"agent1.pddl->orchestrator.pddl\",\\n            \"agent2.pddl->orchestrator.pddl\"\\n        ]\\n    }\\n}\\n```',\n",
