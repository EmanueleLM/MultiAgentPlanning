Failed instances:
- pfile05: Invalid: action precondition violation (hoist reuse) and missing placement actions so goal not achieved. | Issues: Precondition violation at time 29.929: (hoist-lift hoist1 crate7) requires hoist1 to be available at start, but hoist1 is busy in (hoist-put-into-truck hoist1 crate8 truck1) from 5.429 to 33.929 (Load: duration 28.5). hoist1 is not available at 29.929, so this Lift cannot start.; The plan never performs any Drop or Unload actions to place crates from trucks onto surfaces. Many goal predicates are of the form (on ...). After the Loads in the plan crates remain 'in' trucks (or unchanged) and are never placed onto the required surfaces/crates, so the goal cannot be achieved.; Because of the above, the plan both violates action preconditions and fails to achieve the problem goal.
- pfile04: Invalid plan: at least one action violates preconditions | Issues: At time 11.085714: action 'hoist2 put crate5 distributor1 pallet2' (the Drop putting crate5 onto pallet2, D=1.0) requires over-all (clear pallet2) during [11.085714,12.085714]. pallet2 is not clear: pallet2 initially has crate3 on it (on crate3 pallet2) and crate3 is never removed prior to 11.085714. Hence the Drop's precondition (clear pallet2) is false.; At time 12.657143: action 'hoist1 unload crate2 truck1 distributor0 crate6' (an Unload, D=3.285714) requires at-start (available hoist1). Hoist1 was made unavailable at 10.085714 when it started unloading crate6 (Unload sets (not (available hoist1)) at start) and there is no intervening action that makes hoist1 available before 12.657143. Therefore the Unload at 12.657143 violates its at-start precondition.
- pfile16: Invalid plan: multiple actions violate preconditions (and one undefined action 'wait'). | Issues: t=1.000 put-in-truck hoist5 crate3 truck1 depot1: violates Load precondition. Load requires (over all (at truck1 depot1)) during [1.000,3.6667], but truck1 started driving at t=0.000 (drive truck1 depot1->depot0, 0.000–1.800) and is not at depot1 at t=1.000.; t=3.6667 drive truck1 depot1 depot0: violates Drive precondition. Drive requires truck1 to be at depot1 at start, but truck1 was at depot0 after the earlier drive ended at t=1.800 (no action moves it back to depot1 before 3.6667).; t=4.7778 wait hoist0 holding crate2: 'wait' is not an action in the given domain. The plan contains an undefined action.; t=9.8000 unload hoist5 crate2 truck1 depot1: violates Unload precondition. Unload requires (over all (at truck1 depot1)) for the whole unload interval, but a drive truck1 depot0->depot1 is started at t=9.800 (9.800–10.200), so truck1 is not at depot1 at unload start t=9.800.; t=12.6667 unload hoist0 crate3 truck0 depot0: violates Unload precondition. Unload requires truck0 to be at depot0 at start; truck0 departs depot1 at t=5.4667 (drive truck0 depot1->depot0, duration 9.0) and does not arrive until t=14.4667, so truck0 is not at depot0 at t=12.6667.; t=14.1333 put-down hoist5 crate2 pallet1 depot1: violates Drop precondition. Drop requires the target surface (pallet1) to be clear for the drop interval; pallet1 initially has crate1 on it and crate1 is not removed until t=18.5000 in the plan, so pallet1 is not clear at t=14.1333.; t=16.3889 put-down hoist2 crate5 pallet2 distributor0: violates Drop precondition. Drop requires pallet2 to be clear, but crate4 is initially on pallet2 and is not removed before t=16.3889 (crate4 is only lifted at t=17.5000), so pallet2 is not clear at t=16.3889.; t=17.5000 lift hoist0 crate4 pallet2 depot0: violates Lift precondition. Lift requires crate4 to be at depot0 at start; crate4 is initially at distributor0 (on pallet2) and the plan does not place crate4 at depot0 before t=17.5000.
- pfile06: Invalid — several precondition/effect and timing violations | Issues: 0.000 hoist-lift hoist0 crate11 pallet0: Lift requires at start (on crate11 ?surface). Initial state has (on crate11 crate6), not (on crate11 pallet0). The action's source surface is incorrect, so the Lift precondition is violated.; 136.999 hoist-put-down hoist0 crate0 crate8: Put-down/Drop requires the target surface (crate8) to be at the same place and clear for the drop. But crate8 was loaded into truck1 at 103.810–106.667 and there is no prior hoist-unload that puts crate8 down before 136.999. crate8 is inside a truck at that time, so you cannot put crate0 on crate8.; 169.832 hoist-unload hoist1 crate4 truck0: Unload requires (in crate4 truck0) at start. There is no earlier put-in-truck that loads crate4 into truck0, so crate4 is not in truck0 at this time and the Unload precondition is violated.; 202.118 hoist-unload hoist1 crate10 truck1: Unload requires (in crate10 truck1) at start. crate10 was previously loaded into truck0 (at 1.000–10.500) and the plan contains no transfer that would place crate10 into truck1 before 202.118, so this Unload precondition is violated.; Timing inconsistency near the end: hoist-unload hoist0 crate1 truck1 starts at 257.350 with duration 20.667 (so it ends at ≈278.017), but the final hoist-put-down hoist0 crate1 crate9 is scheduled at time 277.000 — before the unload (which makes the hoist hold and lifting) has finished. The final put-down therefore begins earlier than the lifting action it depends on has completed.
- pfile18: Invalid plan: one or more actions violate preconditions / timing constraints. | Issues: Step 0.000: 'hoist3 lift crate10 pallet3 distributor1' — precondition (on crate10 pallet3) fails. In the initial state crate10 is on crate9, not on pallet3.; Step 26.347: 'hoist0 put_in crate0 truck2 depot0' has duration 0.000 but Load duration must be weight(crate0)/power(hoist0) = 7/9 ≈ 0.777. Duration mismatch means effects/timing are incorrect.; Step 33.000: 'hoist2 unload_from_truck crate8 truck1 depot0' starts at 33.000 but crate8 was put into truck1 at 21.348 with duration 15.400, so that put_in finishes at 36.748. You cannot unload crate8 before the put_in has completed.; Step 57.555: 'hoist4 unload_from_truck crate12 truck1 distributor0' attempts to start while hoist4 is still busy: hoist4 began put_in(crate12,truck1) at 24.000 with duration 82.000 (ends at 106.000). hoist4 is not available and is lifting during that interval — the concurrent unload is invalid.; Multiple timing inconsistencies where dependent actions are scheduled before the producing action's effects take place (example: hoist0 unload_from_truck crate14 at 14.904 has duration 5.111 and therefore ends at 20.015, but a put_down of crate14 by hoist0 is scheduled at 19.015 — before unload ends).; Several actions pass surface/holder arguments that do not match the initial 'on' relations (the plan appears to use incorrect surfaces/objects for Lift/Drop in multiple steps).
- pfile20: invalid | Issues: At time 1.286: action 'hoist7 lift hoist7 crate10 pallet7 distributor3' (Lift) fails its precondition (on crate10 pallet7). Initially (on crate10 crate0) holds, so crate10 is on crate0, not on pallet7; the Lift precondition is unsatisfied.
- pfile17: Invalid plan: precondition violations | Issues: At time 3.300: (hoist-putdown hoist6 depot0 crate4 pallet0) requires (over all (clear pallet0)) but pallet0 is NOT clear at 3.300 — crate3 was put onto pallet0 at time 2.000 and no action removes/moves crate3 before 3.300.; At time 19.200: (hoist-lift hoist3 distributor1 pallet3 crate7) requires at start that crate7 is on pallet3 (on crate7 pallet3), but crate7 is initially on crate5 and there is no earlier action that moves crate7 to pallet3 prior to 19.200.
- pfile19: invalid: multiple precondition/effect violations | Issues: 1.333: hoist5 lift crate5 pallet5 — precondition (on crate5 pallet5) is false. In the init crate5 is on crate3 (on crate5 crate3), not on pallet5.; 2.333: hoist5 put crate5 truck1 — requires (lifting hoist5 crate5) over the whole Load. The preceding Lift at 1.333 was invalid, so hoist5 is not guaranteed to be lifting crate5; this Load's precondition is unsatisfied.; 19.000: hoist5 put crate4 pallet5 — Drop/Put requires the target surface (pallet5) to be clear over the whole Drop. pallet5 is initially occupied by crate3 (on crate3 pallet5) and crate3 has not been removed by that time, so (clear pallet5) is false.; 51.167: hoist0 unload crate2 truck1 — Unload has at-start precondition (in crate2 truck1). At 51.167 crate2 is not in truck1 (it was lifted at 51.0 and scheduled to be loaded only at 52.0), so this Unload's precondition fails.; 52.000: hoist4 put crate2 truck1 — Load requires the truck and hoist to be co-located for the whole Load. truck1 left distributor1 for depot0 at 51.167–51.334 and is at depot0 at 52.000, while hoist4 remains at distributor0 — they are not co-located, so this Load cannot start.; 75.596: hoist4 unload crate6 truck0 — hoist4 is already engaged in put crate2 truck1 from 52.000–102.000, so hoist4 is not available at 75.596 and cannot start this Unload.; 99.433: drive truck2 distributor1 depot1 — declared duration is 'D:???:0.000' (unspecified/zero). Drive durations must equal distance/speed (non‑zero here) — this entry is invalid.
- pfile21: Invalid plan: hoist13 fails co-location precondition when unloading crate1. | Issues: Action "15.500 hoist13 unload crate1 truck0" violates the Unload precondition: hoist13 is at depot1 (initial state) but truck0 is at distributor1 at 15.500 (truck0 drove there by '14.833 drive truck0 depot0 distributor1' and arrived at 15.500). Unload requires the hoist and the truck to be co-located throughout the action.; Action "23.155 hoist13 put_down crate1 pallet7" depends on the invalid unload. Independently it also violates Drop preconditions: pallet7 remains at distributor1 (initial) while hoist13 is at depot1, so the hoist and the target surface are not co-located for the Drop.; Because the unload/put_down of crate1 is invalid, the goal literal (on crate1 pallet7) is not achieved — thus the plan does not reach the goal.
