Successful plans: 5 / 12
Successful instances: pfile2, pfile3, pfile4, pfile5, pfile6
Failed instances:
- pfile1: Invalid plan — several actions start exactly when a preceding slew ends and rely on that slew's end effects to satisfy their start/over-all conditions. | Issues: Step 3 — 50.730: (calibrate instrument0 GroundStation2) — requires at start (pointing satellite0 GroundStation2). That pointing is only produced by the slew that ends at 50.730. In PDDL temporal semantics start conditions of actions at time t are checked against the state before processing end-effects at time t, so the calibrate start precondition is not satisfied.; Step 5 — 96.360: (take_image ... Phenomenon4 thermograph0) — requires (over all (pointing satellite0 Phenomenon4)) for the whole image action. The preceding slew to Phenomenon4 ends at 96.360 and only at that end does pointing become true. The image action cannot start at the same instant and rely on that end effect; its over-all pointing requirement is violated at its start.; Step 7 — 105.458: (take_image ... Phenomenon6 thermograph0) — same pattern: the preceding slew to Phenomenon6 ends at 105.458 and makes pointing true only at its end. The take_image starting at 105.458 cannot rely on that end effect to satisfy its over-all/start pointing requirement.; Step 9 — 141.778: (take_image ... Star5 thermograph0) — again the preceding slew to Star5 ends at 141.778 and sets pointing at that end. The take_image starting at 141.778 requires pointing during its interval and cannot use the simultaneous end-effect, so its start/over-all condition is not satisfied.
- pfile10: Invalid — at least one action violates a precondition (missing calibration). | Issues: {'time': 92.329, 'action': '(take_image instrument9 satellite4 Planet10 infrared3)', 'problem': 'Precondition violated: take_image requires the instrument to be calibrated (over all (calibrated instrument9)) but instrument9 is never calibrated in the plan. instrument9 was switched_on (0.514–2.514) but no calibrate action for instrument9 appears; therefore this take_image is not permitted.'}
- pfile16: Plan is invalid: precondition/effect violations | Issues: At t=2.000: (calibrate instrument20 satellite8 GroundStation4) requires (at start (pointing satellite8 GroundStation4)). However the plan starts a slew at t=0.000 (slew satellite8 GroundStation4 Phenomenon5) that deletes (pointing satellite8 GroundStation4) at its start. Satellite8 is not pointing to GroundStation4 at t=2.000, so the calibrate action's at-start condition is not satisfied.; There are several invalid zero-duration/identity slews that violate the turn_to requirement (over all (not (= ?d_new ?d_prev))): e.g. (slew satellite9 Star16 Star16) at t=24.944 [D:0.000] (repeated several times), (slew satellite5 Planet6 Planet6) at t=105.128 [D:0.000], (slew satellite7 Star3 Star3) at t=146.518 [D:0.000]. Each of these has prev == new and therefore violates the domain's precondition.; At t=151.925: (take_image instrument2 satellite0 Planet7 image0) requires (over all (pointing satellite0 Planet7)) for its duration. Immediately before that, satellite0 was executing a take_image on Planet22 from 144.925–151.925 and no slew from Planet22 to Planet7 is scheduled between 144.925 and 151.925. Thus the satellite is not pointing to Planet7 at the start of the image action, violating the take_image precondition.
- pfile17: invalid: multiple precondition violations (first failure at t=3.3987) | Issues: t=3.3987: (take_image instrument2 satellite1 Planet5 image0) — requires satellite1 to be pointing Planet5 for the image, but at t=3.3987 satellite1 is pointing GroundStation0 (it only slews back to Planet5 starting at t=4.3987).; t=84.247 and t=101.414: (take_image instrument8 ... image4) — instrument8 is never switched_on or calibrated in the plan; take_image requires the instrument to be power_on and calibrated (over all) during the image action.; t=83.484 and t=117.444: (take_image instrument4 satellite2 Phenomenon15/Planet16 infrared2) — satellite2 is pointing Phenomenon14 after the slew ending at t=54.794 and there are no intervening slews to Phenomenon15 or Planet16 before these image starts, so the pointing precondition fails.; t=228.39: (take_image instrument23 satellite11 Star21 thermograph1) — requires satellite11 pointing Star21, but satellite11 only slews to Star21 at t=235.39, so this image is scheduled too early.; t=235.39: two slews on satellite11 are scheduled to start simultaneously: (Star22 -> Star21) and (Star21 -> Phenomenon17). The second slew requires satellite11 to be pointing Star21 at t=235.39, which is not true, so that slew's start precondition is violated.
- pfile7: Invalid plan: illegal action and goal not achieved | Issues: At time 2.000: (calibrate instrument0 Star1 satellite0) is illegal — domain requires calibrate duration = calibration_time(instrument0,Star1) = 10.5 but the plan uses duration 0.0.; At time 2.000: (calibrate instrument0 Star1 satellite0) also violates the start precondition (pointing satellite0 Star1). Satellite0 only becomes pointing Star1 at t=4.968, so the calibrate at t=2.000 cannot start.; Final goal not satisfied: the goal requires (pointing satellite2 Phenomenon5), but the plan later turns satellite2 to Planet10 (turn starting at t=62.535, ending at t=66.299). Satellite2 is left pointing Planet10 at the end of the plan, not Phenomenon5.
- pfile8: Invalid plan: timing / precondition-effect conflicts | Issues: Conflict at time 32.08: TAKE_IMAGE (instrument2, Star10, spectrograph3, satellite0) has an at-end requirement (power_on instrument2), but SWITCH_OFF (instrument2, satellite0) starts at 32.08 and has an at-start effect (not (power_on instrument2)). The SWITCH_OFF start deletes the fluent required at the same instant the TAKE_IMAGE ends, invalidating the TAKE_IMAGE end condition.; Conflict at time 86.23: TAKE_IMAGE (instrument1, Planet11, thermograph2, satellite0) requires at-end (power_on instrument1), but SWITCH_OFF (instrument1, satellite0) starts at 86.23 and removes (power_on instrument1) at its start. This simultaneous delete violates the TAKE_IMAGE end condition.; Timing precision mismatch around 72.135: TURN (satellite3, Phenomenon12, Star4) starts at 72.100 with duration 0.0354 → ends at 72.1354, but TAKE_IMAGE (instrument9, Phenomenon12, image0, satellite3) is scheduled to start at 72.135 (0.0004 earlier). The pointing effect from the TURN is not yet established when the TAKE_IMAGE starts, so the TAKE_IMAGE start precondition (pointing satellite3 Phenomenon12) is not satisfied.
- pfile9: Invalid — precondition violations on satellite sat4 (missing pointing to Star9 at 123.63), causing downstream failures and unmet goals. | Issues: At time 123.630: action (take_image sat4 instrument8 Star9 image3) requires (pointing sat4 Star9) at its start. At that time sat4 is pointing Phenomenon6 (set by (slew sat4 Phenomenon6 GroundStation1) which ended at 99.38). There is no action prior to 123.63 that re-establishes (pointing sat4 Star9). The precondition is violated.; At time 130.630: action (slew sat4 Planet5 Star9) requires (pointing sat4 Star9) at its start. That precondition is false because the earlier step that would have pointed sat4 to Star9 (the take_image at 123.63) is invalid. This slew is therefore invalid.; At time 133.498: action (slew sat4 Phenomenon12 Planet5) requires (pointing sat4 Planet5) at its start. Because the prior slew to Planet5 (130.63) is invalid, sat4 is not pointing Planet5 at 133.498; this precondition is violated.; Because the above actions on sat4 fail, the later sat4 actions are invalid as well: (take_image sat4 instrument8 Phenomenon12 image3) at 185.438, (slew sat4 Star14 Phenomenon12) at 192.438, (take_image sat4 instrument8 Star14 image4) at 219.728, and (slew sat4 Planet5 Star14) at 226.728 all require pointings that were never established.; As a consequence, several goal literals are not achieved by the plan: (have_image Star9 image3), (have_image Phenomenon12 image3), (have_image Star14 image4), and (pointing satellite4 Planet5). (Other goals achieved by valid parts of the plan are not listed here.)
