There are a number of agents—trucks and hoists—coordinating to transport and rearrange crates between locations. The world consists of places (depots and distributors). Things that can be located include trucks, hoists, and surfaces; surfaces are either pallets or crates (a crate is both a movable object and a surface that can support another crate). The state records where each locatable is (at), which crate is on which surface (on), which crate is in which truck (in), whether a hoist is available or currently lifting a specific crate, and which surfaces are clear (nothing on top).

Actions take time and use temporal qualifiers: conditions may be required at the start, over all (continuously during the action), or at the end; effects can occur at the start or at the end. Durations depend on numeric fluents:

The truck can be driven from one place to another. Driving the truck between any two locations lasts duration = distance(from, to) / speed(truck).
During the interval it is not “at” any place, so actions that require co-location over all cannot overlap with the drive. Each truck has its own speed, and the distance table is given by distance(place, place') (which can be asymmetric).

A hoist at a place can lift up a crate from a specific surface at the same place. This action lasts 1 time unit. The hoist must stay at place over all; at the start the hoist is available, the crate is at place, the crate is on surface, and the crate is clear. Start effects immediately move the crate out of the place (it is now in the hoist’s grip), set the hoist to lifting that crate and not available, mark the crate not clear, mark the source surface clear, and remove the on relation.

A hoist can put a hoist-held crate down onto a surface at the same place. This action lasts 1 time unit. The hoist, destination surface, surface’s clear status, and the hoist’s lifting status all hold over all. At the end the hoist becomes available and not lifting, the crate becomes at place, the destination surface becomes not clear, the crate becomes clear, and the crate is on the surface.

A hoist can put a hoist-held crate into a truck at the same place. This lasts duration = weight(crate) / power(hoist).
The hoist and truck must remain at place over all, and the hoist must be lifting the crate over all. At the end the crate is in the truck; the hoist stops lifting and becomes available. Heavier crates or weaker hoists make this slower.

Finally, a hoist can unload a crate out of a truck at the same place. This lasts duration = weight(crate) / power(hoist).
The hoist and truck must remain at place over all; at the start the hoist is available and the crate is in the truck. Start effects immediately remove the crate from the truck and put the hoist into not available and lifting that crate. Again, heavier crates or weaker hoists take longer.

In short: trucks are the mobile carriers between places (their travel time depends on distance and their own speed), while hoists stay at their places and are the only way to pick up, put down, load, and unload crates (with load/unload durations scaling with crate weight and hoist power). Plans typically minimize total time.

Objects:
- 1 depot numbered 0..0.
- 2 distributors numbered 0..1.
- 2 trucks numbered 0..1.
- 3 hoists numbered 0..2.
- 3 pallets numbered 0..2.
- 6 crates numbered 0..5.
Initial locations (per place):
- depot0: crate1, hoist0, pallet0, truck0
- distributor0: crate0, crate3, crate4, hoist1, pallet1, truck1
- distributor1: crate2, crate5, hoist2, pallet2
Stacks (bottom -> top) per place:
- depot0: pallet0 -> crate1
- distributor0: pallet1 -> crate0 -> crate3 -> crate4
- distributor1: pallet2 -> crate2 -> crate5
On relations:
- crate3 is on crate0
- crate5 is on crate2
- crate4 is on crate3
- crate1 is on pallet0
- crate0 is on pallet1
- crate2 is on pallet2
Crates in trucks:
- (none)
Hoists:
- available hoists: ['hoist0', 'hoist1', 'hoist2']
Clear surfaces:
- ['crate1', 'crate4', 'crate5']
Truck speeds:
- truck0: 8
- truck1: 8
Hoist power:
- hoist0: 4
- hoist1: 5
- hoist2: 6
Crate weights:
- crate0: 99
- crate1: 89
- crate2: 67
- crate3: 81
- crate4: 4
- crate5: 50
Distances (directed):
- depot0 to [depot0, distributor0, distributor1]: [0, 3, 6]
- distributor0 to [depot0, distributor0, distributor1]: [9, 0, 3]
- distributor1 to [depot0, distributor0, distributor1]: [1, 9, 0]
Note: distances can be direction-dependent; values shown are per direction.
Goals:
- crate5 is on crate0
- crate0 is on crate1
- crate3 is on crate2
- crate2 is on pallet0
- crate4 is on pallet1
- crate1 is on pallet2
Objective: minimize (total-time)
