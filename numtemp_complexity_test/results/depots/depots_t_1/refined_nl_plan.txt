6) Time 44.8472 — hoist1 unloads crate1 from truck1 at distributor0 (hoist-unload-from-truck)
   - Actor: hoist1 at distributor0, truck1 at distributor0 (not moving)
   - Action: remove crate1 from truck1 so hoist1 holds it

   - Preconditions: crate1 is in-truck truck1; hoist1 is available at start; both hoist1 and truck1 remain at distributor0 and truck1 does not move during the unload.
   - Effects: at start hoist1 becomes unavailable and crate1 is no longer in the truck; at end hoist1 is holding crate1.
   - Result at 54.4028: hoist1 holds crate1 at distributor0; crate1 is no longer in truck1.

7) Time 54.4028 — hoist1 puts down crate1 onto pallet1 at distributor0 (hoist-putdown-on-surface)
   - Actor: hoist1 at distributor0
   - Action: put crate1 down on pallet1
   - Duration: 1.00 time unit (starts at 54.4028, ends at 55.4028)
   - Preconditions: hoist1 is holding crate1; hoist1 and pallet1 are at distributor0; pallet1 is clear for the duration.
   - Effects at end: crate1 is on pallet1 and at distributor0; hoist1 becomes available and is no longer holding crate1; pallet1 becomes not clear; crate1 becomes clear.
   - Result by 55.4028: crate1 is placed on pallet1 at distributor0 (goal for crate1 achieved).

8) Time 54.4028 — truck1 drives from distributor0 to distributor1 (truck-drive)
   - Actor: truck1
   - Action: drive from distributor0 to distributor1
   - Distance: dist(distributor0, distributor1) = 5
   - Speed: speed(truck1) = 8
   - Duration: 5 / 8 = 0.625 → reported as 0.62 (starts at 54.4028, ends at 55.0278)
   - Preconditions: truck1 was at distributor0 and not moving at start.
   - Effects: truck1 is not at distributor0 at start and moves during the drive; at end truck1 is at distributor1 and not moving.
   - Result at 55.0278: truck1 arrives at distributor1 carrying crate0.

9) Time 55.0278 — hoist2 unloads crate0 from truck1 at distributor1 (hoist-unload-from-truck)
   - Actor: hoist2 at distributor1, truck1 at distributor1 (not moving)
   - Action: remove crate0 from truck1 so hoist2 holds it
   - Duration: weight(crate0)=11 divided by power(hoist2)=6 → 11/6 ≈ 1.8333 reported as 1.83 (starts at 55.0278, ends at 56.8611)
   - Preconditions: crate0 is in-truck truck1; hoist2 is available at start; both hoist2 and truck1 remain at distributor1 and truck1 does not move during the unload.
   - Effects: at start hoist2 becomes unavailable and crate0 is no longer in the truck; at end hoist2 holds crate0.
   - Result at 56.8611: hoist2 holds crate0 at distributor1.

10) Time 56.8611 — hoist2 puts down crate0 onto pallet2 at distributor1 (hoist-putdown-on-surface)
    - Actor: hoist2 at distributor1
    - Action: put crate0 down on pallet2
    - Duration: 1.00 time unit (starts at 56.8611, ends at 57.8611)
    - Preconditions: hoist2 is holding crate0; hoist2 and pallet2 are at distributor1; pallet2 is clear for the duration.
    - Effects at end: crate0 is on pallet2 and at distributor1; hoist2 becomes available and is no longer holding crate0; pallet2 becomes not clear; crate0 becomes clear.
    - Result by 57.8611: crate0 is placed on pallet2 at distributor1 (goal for crate0 achieved).

Final state summary:
- crate1 is on pallet1 at distributor0 (goal satisfied).
- crate0 is on pallet2 at distributor1 (goal satisfied).
- The sequence respects durations computed from distances, truck speeds, crate weights, and hoist powers; hoists’ availability and truck movement constraints were respected throughout.
