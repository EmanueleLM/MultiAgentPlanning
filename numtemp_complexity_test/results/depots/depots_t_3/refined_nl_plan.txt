These steps, executed in the given order with the stated start times and durations, yield the final configuration:
- crate5 on crate0
- crate0 on crate1
- crate3 on crate2
- crate2 on pallet0
- crate4 on pallet1
- crate1 on pallet2

and satisfy the goal while respecting agent capabilities and temporal/numeric constraints.
