1) Time 0.00 — instrument0 starts switching on aboard satellite0 (duration 2.00)
   - Action: instrument_switch_on(instrument0, satellite0)
   - Starts at 0.00, ends at 2.00.
   - Preconditions at start: instrument0 is on-board satellite0, satellite0 has power available, instrument0 is off.
   - Effects: satellite0 immediately loses available power; at 2.00 instrument0 becomes powered and its calibration is cleared (un calibrated).
   - Notes: Claims the satellite power feed for instrument0 for the subsequent operations.

2) Time 0.00 — satellite0 starts slewing from Phenomenon6 to GroundStation2 (duration 50.73)
   - Action: satellite_turn(satellite0, Phenomenon6 → GroundStation2)
   - Starts at 0.00, ends at 50.73.
   - Preconditions at start: satellite0 is pointing at Phenomenon6.
   - Effects: at start satellite0 is no longer considered pointing at Phenomenon6 (during the turn it points at no direction); at 50.73 satellite0 will be pointing at GroundStation2.
   - Notes: This move positions the satellite to the instrument's calibration target.

3) Time 50.73 — instrument0 starts calibrating on GroundStation2 (duration 5.90)
   - Action: instrument_calibrate(instrument0, satellite0, GroundStation2)
   - Starts at 50.73, ends at 56.63.
   - Preconditions: at start satellite0 is pointing at GroundStation2 and calibration-target(instrument0)=GroundStation2; instrument0 must be powered for the entire calibration interval (it is powered from step 1).
   - Effects: at 56.63 instrument0 becomes calibrated.
   - Notes: Uses the provided calibration-time of 5.9.

4) Time 50.73 — satellite0 starts slewing from GroundStation2 to Phenomenon4 (duration 39.73)
   - Action: satellite_turn(satellite0, GroundStation2 → Phenomenon4)
   - Starts at 50.73, ends at 90.46.
   - Preconditions at start: satellite0 is pointing at GroundStation2 (true at 50.73).
   - Effects: at start satellite0 stops pointing at GroundStation2 (during the turn it points at no direction); at 90.46 satellite0 points at Phenomenon4.
   - Notes: This turn is started at the same timestamp as calibration start in the plan. The domain requires the satellite to point at the calibration target at the start of calibration (which holds at 50.73). Calibration requires instrument to be powered throughout; instrument remains powered because the switch-on completed at time 2.00. The plan schedules both actions to start at 50.73.

5) Time 90.46 — instrument0 takes an image of Phenomenon4 in mode thermograph0 (duration 7.00)
   - Action: instrument_take_image(instrument0, satellite0, Phenomenon4, thermograph0)
   - Starts at 90.46, ends at 97.46.
   - Preconditions (must hold throughout): instrument0 is on-board satellite0, supports-mode thermograph0, instrument0 must be powered and calibrated for the whole 7.0 interval, and satellite0 must be pointing at Phenomenon4 throughout.
   - Effects: at 97.46 have-image(Phenomenon4, thermograph0) becomes true.
   - Notes: instrument0 was calibrated at 56.63 and remains powered, so this imaging is valid once satellite0 finished slewing at 90.46.

6) Time 97.46 — satellite0 starts slewing from Phenomenon4 to Star5 (duration 64.50)
   - Action: satellite_turn(satellite0, Phenomenon4 → Star5)
   - Starts at 97.46, ends at 161.96.
   - Preconditions at start: satellite0 is pointing at Phenomenon4.
   - Effects: at start satellite0 stops pointing at Phenomenon4; at 161.96 satellite0 will point at Star5.

7) Time 161.96 — instrument0 takes an image of Star5 in mode thermograph0 (duration 7.00)
   - Action: instrument_take_image(instrument0, satellite0, Star5, thermograph0)
   - Starts at 161.96, ends at 168.96.
   - Preconditions (throughout): instrument0 on-board, supports thermograph0, instrument0 powered and calibrated across the interval, and satellite0 pointing at Star5 throughout.
   - Effects: at 168.96 have-image(Star5, thermograph0) becomes true.

8) Time 168.96 — satellite0 starts slewing from Star5 back to Phenomenon6 (duration 29.32)
   - Action: satellite_turn(satellite0, Star5 → Phenomenon6)
   - Starts at 168.96, ends at 198.28.
   - Preconditions at start: satellite0 is pointing at Star5.
   - Effects: at start satellite0 stops pointing at Star5; at 198.28 satellite0 points at Phenomenon6.

9) Time 198.28 — instrument0 takes an image of Phenomenon6 in mode thermograph0 (duration 7.00)
   - Action: instrument_take_image(instrument0, satellite0, Phenomenon6, thermograph0)
   - Starts at 198.28, ends at 205.28.
   - Preconditions (throughout): instrument0 on-board, supports thermograph0, instrument0 powered and calibrated across the interval, and satellite0 pointing at Phenomenon6 throughout.
   - Effects: at 205.28 have-image(Phenomenon6, thermograph0) becomes true.

Summary of achieved goals:
- have-image(Phenomenon4, thermograph0) — acquired at time 97.46
- have-image(Star5, thermograph0) — acquired at time 168.96
- have-image(Phenomenon6, thermograph0) — acquired at time 205.28

Total plan makespan: final action ends at 205.28. All actions and timestamps match the provided plan exactly and respect the specified preconditions, durations, and effects.
