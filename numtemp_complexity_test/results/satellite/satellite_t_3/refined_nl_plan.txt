Notes:
- All actions are in the exact order and timing given by the plan. Durations and start times are reported as in the plan.
- After step 24 completes (satellite4 pointing at Planet9), the required final pointing (satellite4 -> Planet9) is satisfied.
- The sequence of calibrations, switch-ons, slews, and image takes ensures that each instrument is powered and calibrated as required before taking its images.
