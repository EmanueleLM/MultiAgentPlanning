Below is a human-readable, step-by-step rendering of the provided plan. Each step matches the plan exactly (no additions or deletions), lists the action, the agent(s) involved, the start time, the duration, and the intended effect toward the goals (powering instruments, slewing satellites, calibrating instruments, taking images). Completion times are shown where useful (start + duration).

Notes and compliance:
- Each action above corresponds exactly to an action line from the supplied plan, preserving start times and durations.
- Durative-action semantics (switch_on, calibrate, slew, take_image) imply the listed preconditions and effects — these are referenced in the step descriptions (powering, slewing, calibration, image acquisition).
- The plan lists modes such as "spectrograph2" and directions like "star4", "phenomenon6" etc.; these are used verbatim in the human-readable steps to stay true to the given plan.
- The timestamps and durations above follow the plan; completion times are start + duration (noting the plan's numeric rounding where present).

If you want, I can:
- Map the plan's anonymous direction/mode names (e.g., star4, phenomenon6, spectrograph2) to the domain/problem's canonical directions and modes if you provide the intended mappings; or
- Produce a compact timeline view (Gantt-like) showing concurrent actions and resource (power feed / slewing) conflicts.
