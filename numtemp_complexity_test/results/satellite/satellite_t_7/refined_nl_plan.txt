   - total-time increased by 53.93.

9) Time 158.366 — Take image with instrument0 on satellite0 of Phenomenon7 using mode spectrograph2. Duration 7.00.
   - Preconditions: instrument0 is onboard, powered, calibrated, supports spectrograph2, and satellite0 is pointing Phenomenon7 throughout 158.366–165.366.
   - instrument0 is marked "using" at start; at end a have_image(Phenomenon7, spectrograph2) is produced and num-images(spectrograph2) increments by 1.
   - At 165.366 the image is obtained.
   - total-time increased by 7.00.

10) Time 165.366 — Slew satellite0 from Phenomenon7 to Phenomenon5. Duration 43.97.
    - During 165.366–209.336 the satellite is slewing and points to no direction.
    - At 209.336 the satellite is pointing Phenomenon5 (this satisfies the pointing goal pointing(satellite0, Phenomenon5)).
    - total-time increased by 43.97.

11) Time 209.336 — Take image with instrument0 on satellite0 of Phenomenon5 using mode spectrograph2. Duration 7.00.

Final state after these actions:
- have_image(Star4, spectrograph2), have_image(Phenomenon7, spectrograph2), have_image(Phenomenon5, spectrograph2), and have_image(Star3, infrared0) are all achieved.
- num-images(spectrograph2) has been increased by 3 (Star4, Phenomenon7, Phenomenon5) satisfying the >=3 requirement.
- num-images(infrared0) has been increased by 1 (Star3) satisfying the >=1 requirement.
- satellite0 is pointing Phenomenon5, satisfying the pointing goal.
- The sequence respects power exclusivity, calibration and pointing constraints, and the specified durations for slews, calibration, switch-on and imaging.
