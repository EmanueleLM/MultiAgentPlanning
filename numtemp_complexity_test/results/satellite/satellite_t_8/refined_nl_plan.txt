Summary of achieved goals after these steps:
 - have_image(Star3, infrared0) obtained (step 13).
 - have_image(Star4, spectrograph2) obtained (step 6).
 - have_image(Phenomenon5, spectrograph2) obtained (step 8).
 - have_image(Phenomenon7, spectrograph2) obtained (step 10).
 - Numeric counts: at least three spectrograph2 images (Star4, Phenomenon5, Phenomenon7) and at least one infrared0 image (Star3).
 - Final pointing: after the last action satellite1 points at Star3; satellite0 was slewed at step 2 to point at Phenomenon5 (satisfying the satellite0 final-pointing requirement). All actions respect power, calibration, and pointing constraints and match the provided plan exactly.
