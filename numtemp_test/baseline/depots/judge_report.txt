- pfile16: Invalid plan: many action instances do not match the domain action schemas (wrong arity / argument order). | Issues: Domain action signatures require 4 parameters for Lift, Load, Drop and Unload (hoist, crate, surface/truck, place), but the plan uses only 3 arguments for these actions.; Step 1: (lift hoist0 crate5 crate2) — Lift expects 4 parameters (?x - hoist ?y - crate ?z - surface ?p - place); plan provides 3.; Step 2: (load hoist0 truck2 crate5) — Load expects 4 parameters (?x - hoist ?y - crate ?z - truck ?p - place); plan provides 3 (and order does not match the schema).; Step 3: (lift hoist0 crate2 pallet0) — Lift expects 4 parameters; plan provides 3.; Step 4: (load hoist0 truck2 crate2) — Load expects 4 parameters; plan provides 3.; Step 6: (unload hoist1 truck2 crate2) — Unload expects 4 parameters (?x - hoist ?y - crate ?z - truck ?p - place); plan provides 3.; Step 7: (lift hoist5 crate3 crate1) — Lift expects 4 parameters; plan provides 3.; Step 8: (load hoist5 truck0 crate3) — Load expects 4 parameters; plan provides 3 (and order mismatch vs. schema).; Step 9: (lift hoist5 crate1 pallet1) — Lift expects 4 parameters; plan provides 3.; Step 10: (drop hoist5 crate1 pallet6) — Drop expects 4 parameters (?x - hoist ?y - crate ?z - surface ?p - place); plan provides 3.; Step 11: (drop hoist1 crate2 pallet1) — Drop expects 4 parameters; plan provides 3.; Step 13: (unload hoist0 truck0 crate3) — Unload expects 4 parameters; plan provides 3.; Step 17: (load hoist2 truck2 crate4) — Load expects 4 parameters; plan provides 3.; Step 18: (unload hoist2 truck2 crate5) — Unload expects 4 parameters; plan provides 3.; Step 21: (unload hoist0 truck2 crate4) — Unload expects 4 parameters; plan provides 3.; Step 22: (drop hoist0 crate4 crate3) — Drop expects 4 parameters; plan provides 3.; Step 23: (lift hoist5 crate0 pallet4) — Lift expects 4 parameters; plan provides 3.; Step 24: (load hoist5 truck1 crate0) — Load expects 4 parameters; plan provides 3.; Step 26: (unload hoist3 truck1 crate0) — Unload expects 4 parameters; plan provides 3.; Step 27: (drop hoist3 crate0 pallet3) — Drop expects 4 parameters; plan provides 3.; Because these action instances do not match the domain's action schemas exactly (wrong number/order of parameters), the plan cannot be accepted as a valid plan for the given PDDL domain/problem.
- pfile18: invalid — plan actions do not match domain signatures (wrong arity/parameters) | Issues: Most non-Drive actions in the candidate plan use 3 arguments but the domain definitions require 4 arguments for Lift, Drop, Load and Unload. Because of this the ground actions cannot be matched to the domain and their preconditions/effects cannot be validated.; Steps with wrong arity (action in plan -> required arity): 1: (lift hoist1 crate11 crate1) -> Lift requires 4 params (?x ?y ?z ?p). 2: (load hoist1 truck0 crate11) -> Load requires 4 params (?x ?y ?z ?p). 4: (unload hoist2 truck0 crate11) -> Unload requires 4 params. 5: (drop hoist2 crate11 pallet5) -> Drop requires 4 params. 7,8,10,11,13,14,16,17,19,20,21,22,24,25,27,28,29,30,32,33,35,36,37,38,40,41,42,43,45,46,47,48,50,51,53,54,56,57,58,59,60,61,63,64,66,67: all use Lift/Load/Unload/Drop with 3 args but domain requires 4.; Some Drive steps (3,6,9,12,15,18,23,26,31,34,39,44,49,52,55,62,65) have the correct arity for Drive, but they cannot make the plan valid because the surrounding lift/load/unload/drop steps are ill-formed.; Fix: supply the missing place parameter for every Lift/Drop/Load/Unload action (four arguments in the order declared in the domain) and ensure the explicit place arguments satisfy the actions' preconditions (e.g. hoist and crate and truck are co-located where required, available/ lifting/clear facts hold).

Successful plans: 3 / 5
Successful instances: pfile13, pfile10, pfile11
Failed instances:
- pfile12: Invalid plan: precondition violated at step 5 | Issues: Step 5 (hoistputdown hoist5 crate12 pallet5 distributor2) fails the Drop precondition (clear pallet5). pallet5 is not clear at that time: crate0 is on pallet5 (initially (on crate0 pallet5)) and crate0 has not been removed before step 5.; Action name mapping note: plan uses nonstandard names (hoistlift/hoistputin/hoistunload/hoistputdown) that must correspond to Lift/Load/Unload/Drop respectively; the validation above assumes those mappings.
- pfile9: Invalid plan: actions not matching domain and multiple precondition violations | Issues: Plan uses action names not defined in the domain. The domain defines: Drive, Lift, Drop, Load, Unload. The plan uses: 'hoist-lift', 'hoist-put-in-truck', 'hoist-take-from-truck', 'hoist-put-down', 'hoist-put-in-truck' (and 'drive' lowercase). Action names must match exactly those in the domain.; Step 17 (hoist-lift hoist1 crate14 crate9 distributor0): precondition violated — Lift requires (available hoist1). After step 16 (hoist-take-from-truck hoist1 crate13 truck0 distributor0) hoist1 became not available and is lifting crate13, so it cannot perform another Lift until it becomes available (i.e. until a Drop or Load/Unload effects restore availability).; Step 58 (hoist-lift hoist1 crate11 pallet4 distributor0): precondition violated — Lift requires (clear crate11). In the initial state crate12 is on crate11, so crate11 is not clear, and crate12 is not moved off crate11 before step 58. Therefore crate11 cannot be lifted at that point.; Multiple other steps rely on the undefined action names and so cannot be validated against the domain (e.g. steps 1,3,5,6,9,11,12,13,14,16,18–20,22–24,26–31,34–36,39–40,42–45,47–48,50–56,58–64). Even where the intended semantics appear to match domain actions, exact action name mismatch makes the plan invalid.; Note: step 54 is (drive truck0 distributor1 distributor1) — driving from a place to the same place is a no-op (it would delete and then re-add the same atom). That is redundant but not the primary cause of invalidity; the primary problems are the undefined action names and the listed precondition violations.

The candidate plan uses action names 'putin' and 'putdown' which are not defined in the domain (occurrences: putin at steps 3, 11, 17, 23; putdown at steps 6, 8, 14, 20, 26, 28).; Because undefined action names appear, the plan does not exactly match the domain and therefore is invalid. (If 'putin' were intended to be 'Load' and 'putdown' intended to be 'Drop', the sequence of preconditions/effects in the remaining steps appears to be consistent and would achieve the goal; but as written the plan fails strict validation against the given domain.)
- pfile12: Invalid plan: action names/parameters do not match domain specification | Issues: Action 1 uses unknown action name 'hoist-lift' (domain defines 'Lift').; Action 1 parameter types/order mismatch for 'Lift': domain expects (hoist crate surface place). Provided: (hoist1 crate12 depot1 crate10) — 'depot1' is a place but was given where a surface is expected, and 'crate10' is a surface but was given where a place is expected.; Many plan action names are not declared in the domain (examples: 'hoist-putin', 'hoist-putdown', 'hoist-unload', 'drive-truck'). The only declared durative action names are: Drive, Lift, Drop, Load, Unload. Because action names do not match, the plan cannot be validated against the domain.; Because of the above mismatches (unknown actions and wrong parameter typing/order), subsequent steps cannot be reliably checked for precondition or effect satisfaction.
- pfile11: Invalid plan: uses action names not defined in domain and omits temporal/duration info | Issues: The plan contains action names that are not defined in the provided domain: 'hoist-lift', 'hoist-putin', 'hoist-takeout', 'hoist-putdown', 'drive-truck'. The domain defines durative actions named 'Lift', 'Load', 'Unload', 'Drop', and 'Drive' (different names).; Steps using undefined actions (examples): step 1 'hoist-lift', step 2 'hoist-putin', step 9 'drive-truck', step 16 'hoist-takeout', step 17 'hoist-putdown', etc. (many steps use the unknown action names).; The domain uses durative actions with explicit durations and temporal conditions (at start, over all, at end). The candidate plan provides no timestamps or durations, so the required temporal constraints (e.g. over all (at ?x ?p) during a Lift/Load/Unload/Drop) cannot be verified.; Because action names do not match and temporal/duration information is missing, the plan cannot be checked against the domain's preconditions/effects and therefore does not validly achieve the goal.
- pfile15: invalid: action 48 violates a precondition | Issues: Step 48: (hoist_lift hoist2 crate3 crate2 depot2) — the Lift action requires at start (clear crate3). This is not satisfied: crate3 is not clear (crate13 is on crate3 in the initial state: (on crate13 crate3)). No prior action clears or moves crate13, so the precondition fails.

Failed instances:
- pfile13: Invalid plan: uses actions not defined in the domain and thus cannot be validated. | Issues: Undefined/incorrect action names: the plan uses 'lift', 'put-down', 'put-in', and 'drive-truck' which do not match the domain's action names (Drive, Lift, Drop, Load, Unload). Action names must match domain actions exactly.; Ambiguous mapping: even if 'lift' → Lift, 'put-down' → Drop, and 'put-in' → Load are intended, the plan must use the domain action names and satisfy durative-action start/over-all/end preconditions and effects explicitly — the submitted plan does not show these and so cannot be checked as a valid grounding of the domain durative actions.; Because of the undefined action names, specific precondition/effect checks (e.g. hoist availability, object locations at action start/end) cannot be conclusively verified; therefore the plan cannot be accepted as valid.
- pfile12: Invalid plan — precondition violation at step 5 | Issues: {'step': 5, 'action': '(put-down hoist5 crate12 pallet5 distributor2)', 'problem': 'Precondition (over all (clear pallet5)) of Drop is not satisfied.', 'details': 'pallet5 is not clear in the state at this point: initially (on crate0 pallet5) holds and crate0 has not been moved before this step, so pallet5 remains occupied. Therefore putting crate12 down on pallet5 violates the Drop precondition.'}
- pfile14: Plan is invalid. | Issues: Undefined action names: the domain defines actions Drive, Lift, Drop, Load, Unload. The plan uses 'putin' and 'putdown' (steps 2,5,7,10,12,15,18,21,24,30,36) which are not actions in the domain.; Wrong parameter ordering for Unload: the domain signature is (Unload ?x - hoist ?y - crate ?z - truck ?p - place). The plan uses the order (unload hoist truck crate place) in steps 9, 11, 17, 23, 29, 35 (i.e. passing a truck where a crate is required), which type-checks incorrectly and violates the action schema.
- pfile11: Invalid plan: precondition failure at step 17 | Issues: Step 17 (putdown hoist5 crate2 pallet5 distributor2) violates Drop precondition: it requires (clear pallet5) over the whole action, but pallet5 is not clear. In the initial state pallet5 supports crate6 (on crate6 pallet5) and no prior action cleared or removed crate6 before step 17.; Because pallet5 is occupied by crate6, the Drop at step 17 cannot place crate2 on pallet5; subsequent steps that assume crate2 on pallet5 (steps 19, etc.) are therefore based on an invalid state.
