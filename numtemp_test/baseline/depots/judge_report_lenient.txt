=== Variant str ===
Timestamp: 2025-09-28T13:24:13
Successful plans: 3 / 5
Successful instances: pfile19, pfile17, pfile16
Failed instances:
- pfile18: Invalid: precondition failure at step 5 | Issues: {'step': 5, 'action': '(drop hoist2 crate11 pallet5)', 'problem': "Precondition violated: drop requires the target surface (pallet5) to be clear at the hoist's place. In the initial state pallet5 is not clear (crate6 is on pallet5) and no prior action clears pallet5 before this drop."}
- pfile20: Invalid plan: a precondition is violated | Issues: Step 26 (drop hoist6 crate2 pallet6 distributor2) is invalid: the Drop action requires (clear pallet6) but pallet6 is not clear. Initially (on crate7 pallet6) holds and crate7 has not been removed from pallet6 prior to this step, so the precondition (clear pallet6) is false.

Successful plans: 2 / 5
Successful instances: pfile10, pfile13
Failed instances:
- pfile11: Invalid plan — a precondition is violated at step 11. | Issues: Step 11 (hoist-putdown hoist5 crate2 pallet5 distributor2) fails precondition: requires (clear pallet5). pallet5 is not clear (crate6 is on pallet5 from the initial state) and no prior action removed crate6 from pallet5, so the Drop action's precondition is unsatisfied.
- pfile9: Invalid plan: step 17 violates action preconditions (hoist1 is not available and is currently lifting crate13). | Issues: Step 17: (hoist-lift hoist1 crate14 crate9 distributor0) is illegal. After step 16 hoist1 is not available (Unload at step 16 sets (not (available hoist1)) and (lifting hoist1 crate13)), so the Lift action's precondition (available hoist1) fails. Additionally hoist1 is already lifting crate13, so it cannot start lifting crate14.; Because step 17 is invalid, all subsequent steps depending on hoist1's availability or the expected effects from step 17 onward are also unreliable.
- pfile12: invalid: plan violates action preconditions | Issues: {'step': 29, 'action': 'hoistputdown hoist0 crate7 pallet0 depot0', 'problem': 'Precondition (clear pallet0) is false. pallet0 was made not clear at step 23 when crate8 was put down on pallet0 and was never cleared afterwards.'}; {'step': 34, 'action': 'hoistlift hoist3 crate4 pallet3 distributor0', 'problem': 'Precondition (on crate4 pallet3) is false. In the initial state crate4 is (on crate4 crate2) and no action before step 34 places crate4 on pallet3.'}

=== Variant st ===
Timestamp: 2025-09-28T13:27:03
Successful plans: 2 / 5
Successful instances: pfile13, pfile14
Failed instances:
- pfile12: Plan is executable but does not achieve the goal. | Issues: The plan's actions appear to respect preconditions and effects (no internal precondition/effect violations detected), but the final state does not satisfy the problem goal.; Many goal conjuncts are not achieved in the final state:;  - Goal (on crate0 pallet4): crate0 is never moved (remains on pallet5).;  - Goal (on crate2 crate0): crate2 is never moved (remains on pallet3).;  - Goal (on crate3 crate9): crate3 remains on crate0 (not on crate9).;  - Goal (on crate6 crate2): crate6 remains on crate3 (not on crate2).;  - Goal (on crate9 pallet2): crate9 is not moved (remains on crate8).;  - Goal (on crate10 crate13): the plan places crate10 on crate14 (step 11), not on crate13.;  - Goal (on crate12 pallet5): the plan moves crate12 to be on crate13 at distributor2 (step 5), not on pallet5.;  - Goal (on crate13 pallet1): crate13 is not moved to pallet1 (it remains on crate9).;  - Goal (on crate14 crate10): goal requires crate14 on crate10, but the plan puts crate10 on crate14 (reversed) and crate14 remains on crate11.; Actions that do satisfy goal conjuncts:;  - (on crate5 pallet0) is achieved (crate5 moved to pallet0 via steps 13-17).;  - (on crate1 crate12) is achieved (crate1 moved onto crate12 in final steps).; Because multiple required 'on' relations are missing or reversed, the plan is invalid with respect to the problem goal.
- pfile15: Invalid plan — a precondition is violated at step 48. | Issues: Step 48 (hoist_lift hoist2 crate3 crate2 depot2) violates Lift precondition: Lift requires the crate being lifted to be clear at start. In the initial state crate13 is on crate3 (on crate13 crate3) and there is no prior action that removes crate13, so crate3 is not clear at this point.; Because step 48 fails, subsequent actions depending on that lift (steps 48 onward) cannot be validated as correct.
- pfile11: Invalid plan: The domain uses durative actions with explicit durations and temporal conditions (at start, over all, at end). The candidate plan provides no timestamps or durations, so the required temporal constraints (e.g. over all (at ?x ?p) during a Lift/Load/Unload/Drop) cannot be verified.; Because temporal/duration information is missing, the plan cannot be checked against the domain's preconditions/effects and therefore does not validly achieve the goal.


=== Variant t ===
Timestamp: 2025-09-28T13:29:55
Successful plans: 3 / 5
Successful instances: pfile13, pfile14, pfile15
Failed instances:
- pfile12: Plan invalid — a precondition is violated at step 5 | Issues: Step 5 (put-down hoist5 crate12 pallet5 distributor2) violates Drop precondition (clear pallet5). In the initial state pallet5 is not clear because (on crate0 pallet5) is true and crate0 has not been moved before step 5, so pallet5 remains occupied.; Because the Drop at step 5 is invalid, subsequent steps that rely on that placement (and hoist/truck availability resulting from it) cannot be assumed correct.
- pfile11: Invalid plan: precondition failure at step 17 | Issues: Step 17 (putdown hoist5 crate2 pallet5 distributor2) violates Drop precondition: it requires (clear pallet5) over the whole action, but pallet5 is not clear. In the initial state pallet5 supports crate6 (on crate6 pallet5) and no prior action cleared or removed crate6 before step 17.; Because pallet5 is occupied by crate6, the Drop at step 17 cannot place crate2 on pallet5; subsequent steps that assume crate2 on pallet5 (steps 19, etc.) are therefore based on an invalid state.
