Failed instances:
- pfile15: Plan is invalid: final state does not satisfy the goal | Issues: Several goal atoms are not achieved in the final state:; (on crate0 crate8) — NOT achieved: crate0 remains on pallet5 (unchanged).; (on crate2 pallet0) — NOT achieved: crate2 remains on pallet8 (unchanged).; (on crate3 pallet1) — NOT achieved: crate3 remains on crate2 (unchanged).; (on crate5 pallet5) — NOT achieved: crate5 remains on crate0 (unchanged).; (on crate6 pallet6) — NOT achieved: crate6 remains on pallet1 (unchanged).; (on crate7 pallet4) — NOT achieved: crate7 remains on crate6 (unchanged).; (on crate8 pallet7) — NOT achieved: crate8 remains on pallet3 (unchanged).; (on crate13 pallet8) — NOT achieved: crate13 remains on crate3 (unchanged).; Goal atoms that are achieved: (on crate1 crate10), (on crate4 crate7), (on crate9 crate4), (on crate10 crate11), (on crate11 crate9), (on crate12 crate5), (on crate14 pallet9).; No durative-action precondition or timing violations were detected in the steps given (assuming the plan's action names map to domain actions as follows: lift→Lift, putin→Load, putdown→Drop, takeout→Unload, and assuming end-effects are available to actions that start at the same timestamp).
- pfile12: Invalid plan: timing / precondition violations | Issues: t=4.000: (lift hoist1 crate10 crate5) has an at-start precondition (available hoist1). hoist1 only becomes available as an at-end effect of (putin hoist1 crate12 truck1) which ends at t=4. Under PDDL happening semantics start-conditions at t=4 cannot rely on end-effects that also occur at t=4, so this lift's start precondition is violated.; t=13.000: (putin hoist1 crate1 truck1) (Load) requires over-all (at truck1 depot1) during [13,16], but (drive truck1 depot1 distributor2) also starts at t=13 and has an at-start effect (not (at truck1 depot1)). The drive removes the truck's location immediately at t=13, so the load cannot satisfy its over-all requirement.; t=23.000: (takeout hoist1 crate13 truck0) (Unload) requires over-all (at truck0 ?p) during [23,27], but truck0 is en route from distributor2 to depot1 (drive truck0 started at t=16 and ends at t=26) and is not at a place at t=23. The unload's over-all precondition on the truck location is therefore violated.; t=30.000: (putdown hoist5 crate12 pallet5) (Drop) requires over-all (clear pallet5) during [30,31]. Pallet5 initially has crate0 on it (on crate0 pallet5) and crate0 is not removed before t=30 (it is moved much later in the plan), so pallet5 is not clear and the drop precondition is violated.; Cascading / dependency failures: several later steps (e.g. putdown at t=27, subsequent placements) depend on earlier unloads/loads that are invalid as above; because those earlier actions cannot legally occur at the scheduled times, the later actions' preconditions/effects are also not established.
- pfile11: Invalid plan: precondition failures (earliest at time 24) | Issues: Time 24.000: Action 'hoist-take-from-truck hoist3 crate8 truck1 distributor0' (Unload) requires (in crate8 truck1) at start, but crate8 was never loaded into truck1. In the initial state crate8 is at distributor2 on crate7 and no prior action places crate8 inside truck1; the precondition is false.; Time 60.000: Action 'hoist-take-from-truck hoist5 crate2 truck0 distributor2' (Unload) requires truck0 to be at distributor2 over [60,64], but truck0 is at distributor1 and is scheduled to drive from distributor1 to distributor2 starting at 60 (drive 60..70). The truck is not at distributor2 at the required time.; Time 65.000: Action 'hoist-take-from-truck hoist5 crate9 truck0 distributor2' (Unload) similarly requires truck0 at distributor2 over [65,69], but truck0 remains in transit until 70 (drive 60..70), so this precondition is also not satisfied.

Successful plans: 0 / 5
Successful instances: None
Failed instances:
- pfile15: Invalid plan: actions violate preconditions and have conflicting timings/locations. | Issues: Time 1.000: (hoist-putdown hoist3 crate8 pallet7 distributor0) requires (over all (clear pallet7)) but pallet7 is not clear in the initial state (on crate9 pallet7) and no earlier action clears pallet7 before 1.000. Precondition violated.; Time 0.000: two drives for the same truck start with conflicting start locations: (drive truck1 distributor2 distributor0) and (drive truck1 distributor1 depot2) both start at 0.000. The second requires truck1 at distributor1 at start, but truck1 is at distributor2 initially. This is impossible.; Multiple actions use the same resources at incompatible times (e.g. repeated/conflicting drive actions for truck1 at the same timestamp and other overlapping uses), making the temporal ordering internally inconsistent.
- pfile12: invalid: actions violate preconditions (hoist availability / resource conflicts) | Issues: At t=2.300: action 'hoist5-unload crate12 truck1 distributor2' requires hoist5 to be available at start. hoist5 is already engaged (hoist5-lift crate13 from 0.000–1.000 and hoist5-putin-truck crate13 from 1.000–9.111) and therefore is not available at 2.300.; At t=2.744: actions 'hoist5-lift crate12 ...' and the subsequent hoist5 putdown overlap the hoist5-putin-truck (1.000–9.111). hoist5 is not free to perform those lifts/puts at 2.744–3.744.; At t=9.711: action 'hoist1-unload crate13 truck0 depot1' requires hoist1 to be available at start. hoist1 began 'hoist1-unload crate14' at 6.100 (duration 6.200 → runs 6.100–12.300) which makes hoist1 unavailable during that interval, so hoist1 cannot start a second unload at 9.711.
- pfile11: Invalid plan — action preconditions violated (first failure at t=34.667) | Issues: t=34.667: Action 'hoist5_putdown' (Drop hoist5 crate3 onto pallet5) violates precondition: Drop requires the target surface 'pallet5' to be clear over the drop interval, but pallet5 is not clear in the initial state (crate6 is on pallet5) and no prior action clears pallet5 before t=34.667.; As a direct consequence, hoist5 remains unavailable and lifting(crate3) (from the Unload started at t=24.000) is never finished — so at t=36.444 the action 'hoist5_lift' requires available(hoist5) at start but hoist5 is not available (precondition violated).; t=37.444: Action 'hoist5_putin' (Load crate8 into truck1) requires over-all(lifting hoist5 crate8) during its interval. Because the preceding lift at t=36.444 cannot correctly start/complete (hoist5 unavailable), this Load's over-all(lifting ...) precondition is not satisfied.; t=41.167: Action 'hoist3_unload' expects crate8 to be in truck1 at start. Crate8 was never successfully loaded into truck1 (see previous failures), so the Unload precondition (in crate8 truck1) is violated.
- pfile13: invalid | Issues: Action at 101.954763: drive truck1 depot2 depot0 has duration 0.600 in the plan but according to the domain it must be (/ (distance depot2 depot0) (speed truck1)) = 9 / 5 = 1.800. The listed duration is inconsistent with the problem distances and truck speed.; Consequent timing/precondition violation: the subsequent action at 102.554763 (hoist-unload hoist0 truck1 crate0 depot0) requires (at truck1 depot0) at its start. With the correct drive duration the truck would arrive at depot0 at 101.954763 + 1.800 = 103.754763, so at 102.554763 the truck is not at depot0 and the Unload precondition is violated.
- pfile14: Invalid plan: multiple precondition and duration violations | Issues: Action 2 (0.000) drive truck1 depot2->distributor0: wrong duration. Expected 3.000 (distance 6 / speed 2) but plan uses 3.500.; Action 4 (3.500) hoist3_lift crate9 pallet3 depot0: precondition (on crate9 pallet3) is false in the initial state. crate9 is on crate2 (on crate9 crate2), not on pallet3.; Action 5 (4.500) hoist3_load crate9 truck1 distributor0: requires (lifting hoist3 crate9) over its execution, but the preceding lift (action 4) failed, so lifting is not established.; Action 10 (19.667) hoist4_lift crate7 pallet4 distributor1: precondition (on crate7 pallet4) is false. crate7 is on crate6 (on crate7 crate6), not on pallet4.; Action 11 (20.667) hoist4_load crate7 truck0 distributor1: requires (lifting hoist4 crate7) which was not established because action 10 is invalid.; Action 12 (31.867) hoist4_lift crate6 pallet4 distributor1: requires (clear crate6) at start. crate6 is not clear initially (crate7 sits on crate6), and because action 10 failed crate6 was never cleared, so this lift's precondition fails.; Action 13 (32.867) hoist4_load crate6 truck0 distributor1: depends on action 12 (lifting crate6), which did not hold, so this load cannot execute.; Action 15 (45.867) hoist1_unload crate6 truck0 pallet1 depot1: requires crate6 to be in truck0 at start. That would only be true if action 13 (hoist4_load crate6) had succeeded; since it did not, this unload's precondition is not met.; Action 17 (56.867) hoist1_unload crate7 truck0 crate6 depot1: requires crate7 to be in truck0 at start. That would only be true if action 11 (hoist4_load crate7) had succeeded; since it did not, this unload's precondition is not met.; Action 23 (96.500) hoist1_unload crate9 truck1 crate7 depot1: requires crate9 to be in truck1 at start. That would only be true if actions 4 and 5 (hoist3_lift/load crate9) had succeeded; they did not, so this unload's precondition fails.
