Failed instances:
- pfile18: Invalid plan — precondition failure at step 2. | Issues: {'step': 2, 'action': '(turn_to satellite2 Star4 Star3)', 'reason': 'Precondition (pointing satellite2 Star3) is not satisfied. At that point satellite2 is pointing Star4 (initial state) so the required previous direction Star3 is false.'}
- pfile17: invalid plan — action 2 has unsatisfied preconditions | Issues: Step 2: (turn_to satellite1 Planet5 Star3) requires (pointing satellite1 Star3) but before this step satellite1 is pointing Planet5. The arguments for turn_to appear reversed; precondition fails.
- pfile19: invalid: step 1 precondition violated | Issues: Step 1: (TURN satellite2 Phenomenon5 GroundStation4) requires (pointing satellite2 GroundStation4) as precondition but initial state has (pointing satellite2 Phenomenon5).
- pfile16: Plan is invalid: many actions do not match domain action names or parameter ordering, so they are not valid ground actions and their preconditions/effects cannot be applied. | Issues: Undefined/incorrect action name: the plan uses action name 'turn' in steps [3, 7, 9, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20, 22, 24, 27, 29, 31, 33, 35, 38, 40, 44, 46, 49, 51, 53, 55, 57, 61, 63, 65, 69, 71, 75, 77, 79] but the domain defines this action as 'turn_to' with parameters (?s ?d_new ?d_prev).; Incorrect parameter ordering for 'calibrate': steps [2, 8, 15, 28, 34, 39, 45, 52, 62, 70, 76] use (calibrate instrument satellite direction). The domain requires (calibrate ?s - satellite ?i - instrument ?d - direction). These groundings are type-mismatched and therefore invalid.; Incorrect parameter ordering for 'take_image': steps [4, 10, 17, 19, 21, 23, 25, 30, 36, 41, 47, 54, 56, 58, 64, 66, 72, 78, 80] use (take_image instrument satellite direction mode). The domain requires (take_image ?s - satellite ?d - direction ?i - instrument ?m - mode). These groundings are type-mismatched and therefore invalid.; Because of the above mismatches, the listed actions are not valid ground instances of the domain predicates and so their preconditions/effects cannot be applied; the plan therefore does not correctly progress the state toward the goal.
- pfile20: invalid plan — action argument order / precondition violations | Issues: Step 2: (CALIBRATE instrument7 satellite0 GroundStation1) — domain defines calibrate parameters as (?s - satellite ?i - instrument ?d - direction). The plan passes instrument7 where a satellite is expected and satellite0 where an instrument is expected (argument order mismatch). This makes the action ill-typed/its preconditions unsatisfied.; Step 3: (TURN_TO satellite0 GroundStation1 Star6) — domain TURN_TO parameters are (?s ?d_new ?d_prev) and requires (pointing ?s ?d_prev). The third argument is Star6, but satellite0 is pointing GroundStation1 at this point, so the precondition (pointing satellite0 Star6) is false.; Because step 2 and step 3 are invalid, subsequent actions depending on them fail: e.g. Step 4 (TAKE_IMAGE satellite0 Star6 instrument7 spectrograph6) requires instrument7 to be calibrated and satellite0 pointing Star6 — neither is established due to the prior failures.; General pattern: many CALIBRATE actions in the plan use the argument order (instrument satellite direction) rather than the domain's (satellite instrument direction). Also multiple TURN_TO uses appear to have swapped new/previous direction arguments, causing precondition (pointing ?s ?d_prev) mismatches.

Failed instances:
- pfile12: Plan is invalid: many actions use wrong parameter ordering / types so preconditions cannot be checked. | Issues: Step 2: (calibrate instrument4 satellite1 Star4) — action calibrate is declared as (calibrate ?s - satellite ?i - instrument ?d - direction). The plan supplies (instrument, satellite, direction) (types: instrument, satellite, direction) which does not match (satellite, instrument, direction).; Step 4: (take_image Star14 thermograph2 instrument4 satellite1) — action take_image is declared as (take_image ?s - satellite ?d - direction ?i - instrument ?m - mode).

The plan therefore does not correctly achieve the goal.
- pfile13: Invalid plan: action names and parameter orders/types do not match the domain (many mismatches). | Issues: Action name mismatch: the domain defines the action 'turn_to' but the plan uses 'turn' throughout (e.g. step 2 '(turn satellite0 GroundStation3 Star19)') — 'turn' is not a defined action.; Parameter order / type mismatches for 'calibrate': domain signature is (calibrate ?s - satellite ?i - instrument ?d - direction). The plan uses (calibrate instrument1 satellite0 GroundStation3) (step 3) — instrument passed where a satellite is expected.; Parameter order / type mismatches for 'take_image': domain signature is (take_image ?s - satellite ?d - direction ?i - instrument ?m - mode). The plan uses forms like (take_image Planet13 thermograph1 instrument1 satellite0) (step 5) — parameters are in wrong order and types do not match (direction passed where satellite expected, etc.).; Many other steps repeat these errors (non-exhaustive): steps 5, 7, 9, 16, 22, 24, 26, 31 (calibrate), 33 (take_image), 35, 43, 45, 51, 53, 55, 57, 63, 69, 71, 73, 80, 82 are inconsistent with the domain parameter order/types or use undefined action names.; Because of the above mismatches the preconditions/effects cannot be correctly applied or checked against the domain/problem; the plan therefore cannot be validated as a correct sequence to reach the goal.

- pfile11: Invalid plan: multiple actions use wrong parameter ordering / types and thus violate action schemas. | Issues: Step 3 (CALIBRATE instrument4 satellite2 Star2): parameter types/order mismatch.

Domain take_image parameters are (?s - satellite ?d - direction ?i - instrument ?m - mode) but each of these steps supplies (satellite instrument direction mode) (i.e. second and third arguments swapped).; Because of the above parameter mismatches, the listed CALIBRATE and TAKE-IMAGE actions are not well-typed w.r.t. the domain and their preconditions/effects cannot be applied. The plan therefore does not correctly apply domain actions and cannot be valid.

Failed instances:
- pfile12: Invalid plan — multiple action signatures/parameter orders do not match the domain, so preconditions/effects cannot be satisfied. | Issues: Step 3,5,7,9,11,14,17,19,22,25,27,30,33,35,38,41,43,45,48,51,54,57,59,61,64,67: use action name 'turn' but domain defines 'turn_to'. The plan's 'turn' calls therefore do not match any action in the domain.; Even if 'turn' were intended as 'turn_to', the domain's parameter order is (turn_to ?s ?d_new ?d_prev). The plan's arguments appear to use a different ordering (e.g. step 3 likely intends to turn from Star4 to Planet10 but provides (turn satellite1 Star4 Planet10) which would mean d_new=Star4, d_prev=Planet10 and fails the at-start pointing requirement). All 'turn' steps thus have incompatible parameter ordering with the domain.; Step 2,16,24,32,40,50,56,66: the plan calls (calibrate instrument satellite direction) but the domain defines calibrate parameters as (?s - satellite ?i - instrument ?d - direction). The argument order is wrong for every calibrate step.; Step 4,6,8,10,12,18,20,26,28,34,36,42,44,46,52,58,60,62,68: the plan calls take_image with ordering (instrument direction mode satellite) but the domain defines take_image as (?s - satellite ?d - direction ?i - instrument ?m - mode). The argument order is incorrect for every take_image step.; Because of the above signature/name mismatches, the plan cannot be checked against the domain's preconditions/effects (e.g. turn_to's start pointing conditions and take_image/calibrate 'over all' and 'at end' conditions cannot be satisfied as written).; Summary: many steps use wrong action names and/or wrong parameter order (particularly all 'turn', all 'calibrate', and all 'take_image' steps). The plan therefore does not correctly implement the domain actions and is invalid.
- pfile15: Invalid plan: step 1 violates preconditions | Issues: {'step': 1, 'action': '(turn satellite0 Star19 GroundStation0)', 'problem': 'Precondition unsatisfied', 'details': "The durative action turn_to requires at start (pointing satellite0 GroundStation0) (third parameter is the previous direction). In the initial state satellite0 is pointing Star19, not GroundStation0, so the action's at-start precondition fails."}
- pfile11: Invalid — action 1 violates its precondition. | Issues: Step 1: (turn satellite2 Star4 Star2) — the domain action is (turn_to ?s ?d_new ?d_prev) and requires at start (pointing ?s ?d_prev). This action thus requires (pointing satellite2 Star2) at its start, but the initial state has (pointing satellite2 Star4). Therefore the precondition of action 1 is not satisfied.
- pfile13: Invalid plan: action 1 has unsatisfied precondition | Issues: Action 1 (turn satellite4 Phenomenon5 Star4) requires (pointing satellite4 Star4) at start, but initial state has (pointing satellite4 Phenomenon5). The turn parameters are reversed; the required 'pointing' fact does not hold.
- pfile14: invalid — action name / parameter-order mismatches cause preconditions to fail (first failure at step 1) | Issues: Step 1 invalid: plan action (turn satellite0 Phenomenon12 GroundStation2). Domain defines the action as 'turn_to' with parameters (?s - satellite ?d_new - direction ?d_prev - direction). The plan uses action name 'turn' (no such action in the domain) and the parameter order is inconsistent with the domain. Using the domain ordering this step would require (pointing satellite0 GroundStation2) at start, but the initial state has (pointing satellite0 Phenomenon12). Precondition not satisfied.; Systematic parameter-order errors: many actions in the plan pass arguments in a different order than the domain specifies. Examples: step 3 'calibrate instrument0 satellite0 GroundStation2' uses (instrument, satellite, direction) but domain calibrate expects (?s ?i ?d) i.e. (satellite, instrument, direction); step 5 'take_image instrument0 satellite0 Phenomenon12 thermograph0' uses (instrument, satellite, direction, mode) but domain take_image expects (?s ?d ?i ?m) i.e. (satellite, direction, instrument, mode). These mismatches will make the required preconditions (e.g. pointing, calibration_target, supports, on_board, power_on) be checked on wrong objects and therefore fail.; Because of the incorrect action name and widespread argument-order mismatches, the stated preconditions and effects in the domain are not respected by the plan; the plan therefore does not reach the goal legally and is invalid.

Domain: (calibrate ?s - satellite ?i - instrument ?d - direction). Plan uses (calibrate instrument satellite direction) in steps: 3, 13, 23, 40, 58, 69. This violates parameter typing and so preconditions/effects cannot be correctly applied.; take_image actions use the wrong argument order. Domain: (take_image ?s - satellite ?d - direction ?i - instrument ?m - mode). Plan uses (take_image instrument direction mode) (instrument in first position) in steps: 5, 7, 9, 15, 17, 19, 25, 27, 29, 31, 33, 35, 42, 44, 46, 48, 50, 52, 54, 60, 62, 64, 71, 73. This breaks precondition/effect matching (pointing, supports, power_on, etc.).; Because of the above arity/ordering mismatches, action preconditions and effects cannot be correctly matched to the problem facts (types and predicates mismatch). The plan therefore does not correctly (and exactly) follow the domain definition and cannot be validated as achieving the goal.
