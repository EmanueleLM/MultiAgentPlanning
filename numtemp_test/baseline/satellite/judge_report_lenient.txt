Successful plans: 1 / 5
Successful instances: pfile9
Failed instances:
- pfile12: Invalid plan: step 15 violates preconditions. | Issues: Step 15 (take_image Planet11 infrared3 instrument4 satellite1) is invalid: the precondition (pointing satellite1 Planet11) is not satisfied. At that point in the plan the satellite1 is pointing at Phenomenon21 (after step 13) and was never turned to Planet11 prior to step 15.; Because step 15 fails, subsequent actions that depend on its effects (and any later assumed spacecraft pointing or instrument states) cannot be validated; the plan does not correctly achieve the goal.
- pfile13: Invalid plan: a precondition is violated at step 12. | Issues: Step 12: (calibrate instrument0 satellite0 GroundStation3) — precondition requires (pointing satellite0 GroundStation3) and (power_on instrument0). At that point in the plan (after step 11) satellite0 is pointing Star21 (not GroundStation3), so the pointing precondition is not satisfied.; Because step 12's precondition fails, subsequent dependent actions (e.g. the later calibrate at step 14 is the correct placement) invalidate the plan as presented.
- pfile10: Plan invalid: step 22 (TURN satellite4 Star16 Star0) violates fuel precondition. | Issues: {'step': 22, 'action': 'TURN satellite4 Star16 Star0', 'precondition_failed': '(>= (fuel satellite4) (slew_time Star16 Star0))', 'required': 74.69, 'actual': 8.3168, 'explanation': "At step 22 satellite4 has only 8.3168 units of fuel remaining (after previous TURNs: 0.5146, 0.5146, 18.87, 64.85, 15.09, 9.744, 3.16, 78.94), which is less than the required slew_time 74.69 for turning to Star16. Therefore the TURN action's fuel precondition is not satisfied and the plan is invalid."}
- pfile11: Plan is invalid: not all goal literals achieved. | Issues: Missing goal literal: (have_image Phenomenon15 infrared0) — plan never takes an image of Phenomenon15 in mode infrared0.; Missing goal literal: (have_image Star17 infrared0) — plan never takes an image of Star17 in mode infrared0.

=== Variant st ===
Timestamp: 2025-09-28T13:34:42
Successful plans: 4 / 5
Successful instances: pfile13, pfile12, pfile15, pfile14
Failed instances:
- pfile11: Plan fails to achieve all goals | Issues: Missing goal: (have_image Phenomenon7 infrared1) — no action in the plan produces have_image Phenomenon7 infrared1.

=== Variant t ===
Timestamp: 2025-09-28T13:36:54
Successful plans: 4 / 5
Successful instances: pfile12, pfile14, pfile11, pfile13
Failed instances:
- pfile15: Invalid plan — a precondition is violated at step 12 (and propagates). | Issues: Step 12: (take_image instrument13 Star12 thermograph3 satellite6) — requires (pointing satellite6 Star12) during the action. At this point satellite6 is pointing Star3 (set by step 9), so the pointing precondition is not satisfied.; Step 13: (turn satellite6 Star13 Star12) — requires (pointing satellite6 Star12) at start. Because step 12/earlier did not establish pointing Star12, this precondition fails.; Steps 14–18: These actions depend on the successful execution of steps 12–13 (obtaining pointing Star12 then Star13). Since those earlier steps fail, the subsequent take_image/turn actions on satellite6 are also invalid.
