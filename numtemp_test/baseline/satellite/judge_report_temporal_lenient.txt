Successful plans: 2 / 5
Successful instances: pfile11, pfile14
Failed instances:
- pfile13: Invalid — plan contains steps that are not actions in the given domain / malformed NO_OP entries. | Issues: Unknown / malformed actions present: the plan contains entries that do not correspond to any durative-action in the domain. Examples: at 29.000 '(take_image instrument1? NO_OP)' and '(take_image instrument3? duplicate)' (D:0) — these look like NO_OP or comment placeholders, not valid domain actions.; Unknown action name 'arrive-and-hold' (appears at 89.000 and 90.000). There is no 'arrive-and-hold' durative-action in the provided domain; the domain only defines turn_to, switch_on, switch_off, calibrate, take_image.; Because of the invalid/malformed actions above the plan is not a valid instantiation of the provided domain. (Aside: aside from those invalid entries, the real durative actions—turn/switch_on/calibrate/take_image—appear to be used consistently with respect to timing, durations, preconditions and effects and the plan does achieve the goal literals.)
- pfile12: Invalid plan: instrument4 is powered off before later image actions (and is switched-off twice). | Issues: At t=67.000 the plan executes (switch_off instrument4 satellite1). That removes (power_on instrument4) at the start of the action (so instrument4 is powered off after t=67).; At t=72.000 the plan executes (take_image instrument4 satellite1 Planet11 infrared3) which requires (over all (power_on instrument4)) during [72,79]. Instrument4 is not powered on at t=72 (it was switched off at 67 and never switched on again), so this take_image violates its precondition.; At t=84.000 the plan executes (take_image instrument4 satellite1 Phenomenon21 thermograph2) which likewise requires instrument4 to be powered on during [84,91]. Instrument4 remains powered off, so this action also violates its precondition.; At t=91.000 the plan executes (switch_off instrument4 satellite1) again. This action requires (at start (power_on instrument4)), but instrument4 is already powered off (switched off at t=67 and not re-switched-on), so the start precondition fails.; Because the two take_image actions for instrument4 (at t=72 and t=84) cannot run, the plan will not achieve the corresponding goal facts (e.g. have_image Planet11 infrared3 and have_image Phenomenon21 thermograph2).
- pfile15: Invalid plan: multiple precondition and temporal inconsistencies | Issues: At 32.000: (calibrate instrument7 satellite4 Star3) starts but satellite4 is not pointing at Star3 at t=32. The turn that sets satellite4->Star3 runs 30.000..35.000 and only establishes (pointing satellite4 Star3) at t=35. The calibrate at t=32 therefore violates its at-start precondition (pointing satellite4 Star3).; At 37.000: (switch-off instrument1 satellite0) starts but instrument1 is not powered at t=37. Instrument1 was switched-off at 36.000 (the start-effect of that action removes (power_on instrument1)), so the second switch-off at t=37 fails the at-start precondition (power_on instrument1).; At 49.000: several switch-off actions attempt to run although the instruments are already off. (switch-off instrument9 satellite4) and (switch-off instrument16 satellite7) were already executed at 24.000, and (switch-off instrument5 satellite2) was executed at 48.000 — their at-start precondition (power_on <instrument>) is false at t=49.; Cascading error: because (calibrate instrument7 satellite4 Star3) at 32.000 is invalid, the later (take-image instrument7 satellite4 Planet23 thermograph3) at 42.000 cannot rely on instrument7 being calibrated (and thus its take-image preconditions are not met).; The plan contains many duplicate and out-of-order entries (redundant switch-offs, repeated turns with inconsistent required pointings, duplicate actions with conflicting times). These create further temporal contradictions and multiple additional precondition failures (examples: duplicate switch-off of instrument1 at 36.000 and 37.000; multiple repeated switch-offs at 49.000).

Successful plans: 2 / 5
Successful instances: pfile11, pfile12
Failed instances:
- pfile14: Invalid plan — precondition violation (conflicting/duplicated slews on satellite5). | Issues: The plan contains two overlapping turn_to/slew actions for satellite5 with the same parameters: one starting at 281.561 and another at 295.502. The durative action turn_to has an at-start effect (not (pointing ?s ?d_prev)); the first slew at 281.561 therefore removes (pointing satellite5 Phenomenon11) immediately. The second slew at 295.502 requires (pointing satellite5 Phenomenon11) at its start, but that predicate is no longer true (removed at 281.561). Hence the second slew's at-start precondition is violated.; The two slew durations for satellite5 (56.821 and 42.880) do not match the domain's slew_time for Phenomenon11->Planet17 (which is 88.44 in the problem file).
- pfile13: Plan is invalid: missing goal facts and action timing/duration errors | Issues: Missing goal facts: no take_image in the plan produces (have_image Planet7 image3).; Missing goal facts: no take_image in the plan produces (have_image Planet8 image3).; Duration mismatch: (slew satellite2 Planet16 Star14) is listed with D:36.73 but the domain requires slew_time Star14->Planet16 = 52.66.; Duration mismatch: (slew satellite2 Phenomenon18 Planet16) is listed with D:22.03 but the domain requires slew_time Planet16->Phenomenon18 = 43.9.; Duration mismatch: (slew satellite2 Planet11 Phenomenon18) is listed with D:55.50 but the domain requires slew_time Phenomenon18->Planet11 = 32.39.; Duration mismatch: (slew satellite1 Planet9 Planet17) is listed with D:95.27 but the domain requires slew_time Planet17->Planet9 = 21.22.; Potential timing/precondition conflict: (take_image instrument0 Planet6 image4) ends at 126.13 while (switch_off instrument0 satellite0) starts at 126.13. switch_off has a start effect (not (power_on instrument0)) which would conflict with the take_image's at-end requirement (power_on instrument0) if effects are applied simultaneously.
- pfile15: Invalid — several actions violate preconditions (satellites are not pointing at the required directions or required facts are not true at action start times). | Issues: 76.020: (take_image instrument9 satellite4 Phenomenon9 infrared0) — fails because satellite4 is pointing Star3 at t=76.02 (the slew at t=0 changed satellite4 from Phenomenon9 to Star3 and no subsequent slew returns it to Phenomenon9 before 76.02). The take_image requires over-all (pointing satellite4 Phenomenon9).; 124.920: (take_image instrument10 satellite5 Planet6 spectrograph2) — fails because satellite5 is not pointing Planet6 at t=124.92. Satellite5 was slewed at t=0 to GroundStation0 (end 44.01) and no action restores pointing to Planet6 before 124.92, so the over-all (pointing satellite5 Planet6) condition is false.; 131.920: (slew satellite5 Planet6 Planet21) — cannot start at t=131.92 because its start precondition requires (pointing satellite5 Planet6) at that time, which does not hold (satellite5 is pointing GroundStation0).; 145.290: (take_image instrument4 satellite2 Star13 thermograph3) — cannot start at t=145.29 because satellite2 does not point to Star13 until the slew from Star12 to Star13 completes (that slew ends at 188.49). The take_image requires over-all (pointing satellite2 Star13) across its duration.; 152.050: (take_image instrument2 satellite1 Phenomenon5 spectrograph2) — cannot start at t=152.05 because satellite1's slew to Phenomenon5 starts at 145.05 and only finishes at 201.68; satellite1 is not pointing Phenomenon5 at 152.05.; 169.610: (take_image instrument0 satellite0 Planet14 thermograph4) — cannot start at t=169.61 because satellite0 does not have Planet14 pointing until the slew Planet11->Planet14 (started at 162.61) finishes at 198.71.; 216.440: (take_image instrument0 satellite0 Star15 thermograph4) — cannot start at t=216.44 because the slew Planet14->Star15 that would produce Star15 pointing only finishes at 256.27; satellite0 is not pointing Star15 during 216.44..223.44.; General / systemic: multiple take_image and slew actions are scheduled while a satellite is mid-slew (pointing removed at slew start and new pointing only available at slew end). Several take_image or subsequent slews assume pointing that is not present at the specified start times. These timing/pointing precondition violations render the plan invalid and prevent achieving the stated goals.
