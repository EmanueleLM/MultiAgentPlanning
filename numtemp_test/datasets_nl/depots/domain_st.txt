There are a number of agents (trucks and hoists) coordinating to transport and rearrange crates between locations. The world has places—depots and distributors. Things that can be located include trucks, hoists, and surfaces; surfaces are either pallets or crates (a crate is both a movable object and a surface that can support another crate). The state records where each locatable is (at), which crate is on which surface (on), which crate is in which truck (in), which hoist is available or currently lifting a specific crate, and which surfaces are clear (nothing on top).

Actions take time and use temporal qualifiers: conditions may be required at the start, over all (continuously during the action), or at the end; effects may occur at the start or the end. The plan metric is typically to minimize total time.

The truck can be driven from one place to another. Driving the truck between any two locations lasts 10 time units. Because only the start and end positions are stated, the truck is not considered at any place during the travel interval, so other actions that require it to be co-located over all cannot overlap with the drive.

A hoist at a place can lift up a crate from a specific surface at the same place. This action lasts 1 time unit. The hoist must remain at place over all; at the start the hoist is available, the crate is at place, the crate is on surface, and the crate is clear. The start effects immediately move the crate out of the place (it’s now in the hoist’s grip), set the hoist to lifting that crate and not available, mark the crate not clear, mark the source surface clear, and remove the on relation.

A hoist can put a hoist-held crate down onto a surface at the same place. This action lasts 1 time unit. The hoist, the destination surface, and the hoist’s lifting status hold over all, and the surface stays clear over all. At the end the hoist becomes available and not lifting, the crate becomes at place, the destination surface becomes not clear, the crate becomes clear, and the crate is on the surface.

A hoist can put a hoist-held crate into a truck at the same place. This lasts 3 time units. The hoist and truck must remain at place over all, and the hoist must be lifting the crate over all. At the end the crate is in the truck, the hoist stops lifting and becomes available.

Finally, a hoist can take a crate out of a truck at the same place. This lasts 4 time units. The hoist and truck must remain at place over all; at the start the hoist is available and the crate is in the truck. The start effects immediately remove the crate from the truck and have the hoist become not available and lifting that crate.

In short: trucks are the only things that move between places (via a timed drive), while hoists stay at their places and are the only means to pick up, put down, load, and unload crates. Plans must schedule actions so that required co-locations and “keep true over the whole interval” conditions do not conflict.
