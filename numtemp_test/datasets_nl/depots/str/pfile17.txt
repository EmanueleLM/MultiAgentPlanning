There are a number of agents—trucks and hoists—coordinating to transport and rearrange crates between locations. The world contains places (depots and distributors). Things that can be located include trucks, hoists, surfaces, and crates; surfaces come in two kinds: pallets and crates (so a crate is both a movable item and a surface that can support another crate). The state tracks where every locatable is (at), which crates are on which surfaces (on), which crates are in which trucks (in), whether a hoist is available (idle), whether it is lifting a particular crate, and whether a surface is clear (nothing on top).

Drive moves a truck from one place to another. It requires that the truck is at the origin; its effect is that the truck is no longer at the origin and is now at the destination.

Lift uses a hoist at some place to pick up a specific crate from a specific surface at that same place. The hoist must be at the place and available, the crate must also be at the place, the crate must be on that surface, and the crate must be clear. The effects are: the crate is no longer at the place (it’s in the hoist’s grip), the hoist becomes lifting that crate and no longer available, the source surface becomes clear, and the on relation between the crate and surface is removed. While a hoist is lifting, the lifted crate is not clear.

Drop puts a crate down onto a surface at the same place using the hoist that is currently lifting it. The hoist and the destination surface must be at the place, the destination surface must be clear, and the hoist must be lifting the crate. The effects are: the hoist becomes available, is no longer lifting the crate, the crate is again at the place, the destination surface is no longer clear, the crate itself becomes clear, and the crate is now on the destination surface.

Load puts a crate into a truck at the same place, using a hoist that is lifting it. The hoist and the truck must be at that place, and the hoist must be lifting the crate. The effects are: the hoist is no longer lifting the crate, the crate is now in the truck, and the hoist becomes available.

Unload takes a crate out of a truck at the same place and immediately has a hoist start lifting it. The hoist and the truck must be at the place, the hoist must be available, and the crate must be in the truck. The effects are: the crate is no longer in the truck, the hoist becomes not available, and it is now lifting that crate.

In short: trucks are the only things that move between places; hoists stay at their assigned places and are used to pick up, put down, load, and unload crates.
