There are a number of agents (satellites) coordinating to make observations, each carrying one or more scientific instruments. Every instrument supports specific modes of measurement (e.g., thermography, spectrography, generic imaging). The environment contains named directions—stars, ground stations, phenomena—that satellites can point at in order to observe. In addition to the discrete state, each satellite has real-valued fuel and data capacity (on-board storage). There are also two global counters: fuel-used and data-stored. Finally, the you are provided two tables of numeric values: slew_time(a,b), the fuel cost to turn from direction b to direction a, and data(d,m), the storage required to record an image of direction d in mode m.

Each satellite can point at exactly one direction at a time. To re-aim, a satellite turns from its current direction to a different one; you may not turn to the same place. A turn is allowed only if the satellite’s current fuel is at least slew_time(new, prev). Executing the turn updates the pointing (the satellite is now pointing at the new target and no longer at the old one), decreases that satellite’s fuel by slew_time(new, prev), and increases the global fuel-used by the same amount.

Instruments live on board particular satellites. Using any instrument draws from the satellite’s single power feed: switching an instrument on requires that the satellite’s power_avail is true; doing so asserts that the instrument is power_on, makes power_avail false (so no second instrument can be on at the same time), and clears its calibration. Switching an instrument off requires that it is currently on; this turns it off and restores power_avail on the satellite.

Before an instrument can be used for science, it must be calibrated. Each instrument has a designated calibration target (a specific direction). Calibrating requires: the instrument is on board the satellite, the satellite is currently pointing at that target, and the instrument is powered on. The effect is that the instrument becomes calibrated. Calibration persists until you switch that instrument on again (which clears it), so a typical pattern remains: switch on → point at the calibration target → calibrate → point at the science target → take the image → optionally switch off to free power.

To take an image at some direction in some mode, five discrete conditions must hold: the instrument is on board the satellite, supports the requested mode, is powered on, the satellite is pointing at the target direction, and the instrument is calibrated. The numeric guard adds a sixth condition: the satellite’s data_capacity must be at least data(direction, mode). Taking the image then decreases the satellite’s data capacity by data(direction, mode), increases the global data-stored by the same amount, and asserts that you have_image(direction, mode).

All other relations are static: what an instrument supports, which satellite it is on board, and each instrument’s calibration target never change during execution. The only changing numeric quantities are per-satellite fuel and data_capacity and the global accumulators fuel-used and data-stored; the only changing discrete predicates are the satellite’s pointing direction, per-instrument power_on and calibrated, and per-satellite power_avail.
