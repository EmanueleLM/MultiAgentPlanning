There are a number of agents (satellites) coordinating to make observations, each carrying one or more scientific instruments. Every instrument supports specific modes of measurement (e.g., broadband images, infrared, thermography, spectrography). The environment contains named directions—stars, planets, ground stations, phenomena—that satellites can point at in order to observe.

Each satellite can point at exactly one direction at a time. To re-aim, a satellite turns from its current direction to a different one; after the turn it is pointing at the new target and no longer at the old one (you may not “turn” to the same place). Instruments live on board particular satellites. Using any instrument draws from the satellite’s single power feed: switching an instrument on requires the satellite’s power to be available; doing so consumes that availability (no second instrument can be on at the same time) and also clears that instrument’s calibration. Switching an instrument off frees the satellite’s power again.

Before an instrument can be used, it must be calibrated. Each instrument has a designated calibration target (a specific direction). Calibrating requires the host satellite to be currently pointing at that target and the instrument to be powered on; the result is that the instrument is calibrated. Calibration persists across actions, but any subsequent switch_on of that instrument removes the calibration, so typical use is: switch on → slew to the calibration target (if not already) → calibrate → slew to the science target → take the image → (optionally) switch off to free power.

To take an image at some direction in some mode, the satellite must be pointing at that direction, the relevant instrument must be on board and powered on, the instrument must support the requested mode and be calibrated. Taking the image produces the corresponding scientific product (you “have_image” for that direction and mode). Problem goals ask for a set of such images and may also require certain satellites to end up pointing at specific directions. In this STRIPS version there are no durations, no numeric resources, and no costs—it’s pure classical planning with the power-availability predicate modeling “only one instrument on per satellite” as a logical resource.
