Summary: the following 24 sequential steps follow the provided plan exactly. Each step shows: timestamp (t = step index), agent action, location, immediate effects (movement/stacking/loading/unloading), changes to truck loads, hoist availability/holding, and cumulative fuel-cost. All actions and effects match the PDDL domain semantics.

Initial state (before t=0):
- fuel-cost = 0
- truck0 load = 0; truck0 load-limit = 370
- truck1 load = 0; truck1 load-limit = 287
- crate weights: crate0=96, crate1=72, crate2=74, crate3=16, crate4=23, crate5=42
- locations: hoist0@depot0, hoist1@depot1, hoist2@depot2, hoist3@distributor0, hoist4@distributor1, hoist5@distributor2
- crates: crate1@depot0(on pallet0), crate0@depot1(on pallet1), crate4@depot2(on pallet2), crate5@distributor0(on pallet3), crate2@distributor2(on pallet5), crate3 on crate2 at distributor2
- clear surfaces: crate0, crate1, crate3, crate4, crate5, pallet4
- all hoists available

Step-by-step execution

t=0 — Step 1
Action: hoist5 lifts crate3 (from top of crate2) at distributor2.
Effects:
- hoist5 now holding crate3; hoist5 becomes not available.
- crate3 is no longer on crate2 and is not at distributor2.
- crate2 (surface) becomes clear.
- fuel-cost increases by 1 → cumulative fuel-cost = 1.

t=1 — Step 2
Action: hoist2 lifts crate4 (from pallet2) at depot2.
Effects:
- hoist2 now holding crate4; hoist2 becomes not available.
- crate4 no longer on pallet2 and not at depot2.

Action: hoist3 lifts crate5 (from pallet3) at distributor0.
Effects:
- hoist3 now holding crate5; hoist3 becomes not available.
- crate5 no longer on pallet3 and not at distributor0.
- pallet3 becomes clear.
- fuel-cost +1 → cumulative = 3.

t=3 — Step 4
Action: hoist1 lifts crate0 (from pallet1) at depot1.
Effects:

- fuel-cost +1 → cumulative = 5.

t=5 — Step 6
Action: hoist2 places crate4 into truck1 at depot2 (hoist2 was holding crate4; truck1 at depot2).
Effects:
- crate4 is now in truck1.
- hoist2 releases crate4 and becomes available.
- truck1 current-load increases by crate4 weight (23): truck1 load 0 → 23.
- crate4 is not clear (inside truck).
- fuel-cost +1 → cumulative = 6.

t=6 — Step 7
Action: hoist1 places crate0 into truck0 at depot1 (hoist1 was holding crate0; truck0 at depot1).
Effects:
- crate0 is now in truck0.
- hoist1 releases crate0 and becomes available.
- truck0 current-load increases by crate0 weight (96): truck0 load 0 → 96.
- crate0 is not clear (inside truck).
- fuel-cost +1 → cumulative = 7.

t=7 — Step 8
Action: truck1 drives from depot2 to distributor2.
Effects:
- truck1 location depot2 → distributor2.

Effects:
- truck0 location depot1 → distributor2.
- fuel-cost +10 → cumulative = 27.

t=9 — Step 10
Action: hoist5 places crate3 into truck1 at distributor2 (hoist5 was holding crate3; truck1 is now at distributor2).
Effects:
- crate3 is now in truck1.
- hoist5 releases crate3 and becomes available.
- truck1 load increases by crate3 weight (16): truck1 load 23 → 39.
- crate3 is not clear (inside truck).
- fuel-cost +1 → cumulative = 28.

t=10 — Step 11
Action: hoist5 lifts crate2 (from pallet5) at distributor2.
Precondition context: after step 1 crate2 was clear (crate3 had been lifted), and pallet5 was present at distributor2; hoist5 is available and at distributor2.
Effects:
- hoist5 now holding crate2; hoist5 becomes not available.
- crate2 no longer on pallet5 and not at distributor2.
- pallet5 becomes clear.
- fuel-cost +1 → cumulative = 29.

t=11 — Step 12

Effects:
- crate2 now in truck1.
- hoist5 releases crate2 and becomes available.
- truck1 load increases by crate2 weight (74): truck1 load 39 → 113.
- crate2 is not clear (inside truck).
- fuel-cost +1 → cumulative = 30.

t=12 — Step 13
Action: hoist5 takes crate4 out of truck1 at distributor2.
Effects:
- crate4 removed from truck1 and hoist5 is holding crate4; hoist5 becomes not available.
- truck1 load decreases by crate4 weight (23): truck1 load 113 → 90.
- fuel-cost +1 → cumulative = 31.

t=13 — Step 14
Action: hoist5 puts crate4 down on pallet5 at distributor2 (hoist5 holding crate4; pallet5 at distributor2).
Effects:
- crate4 is now on pallet5 at distributor2.
- hoist5 releases crate4 and becomes available.
- crate4 becomes a surface (not clear because something may be placed on it later) — specifically crate4 is placed on pallet5; pallet5 no longer clear.
- fuel-cost +1 → cumulative = 32.

t=14 — Step 15
Action: truck1 drives from distributor2 to distributor0.
Effects:
- truck1 location distributor2 → distributor0.
- fuel-cost +10 → cumulative = 42.

t=15 — Step 16
Action: hoist5 takes crate0 out of truck0 at distributor2.
Context: truck0 drove to distributor2 at t=8, so truck0 is at distributor2, and crate0 was in truck0 from t=6.
Effects:
- crate0 removed from truck0 and hoist5 is holding crate0; hoist5 becomes not available.
- truck0 load decreases by crate0 weight (96): truck0 load 96 → 0.
- fuel-cost +1 → cumulative = 43.

t=16 — Step 17
Action: hoist3 places crate5 into truck1 at distributor0 (hoist3 was holding crate5; truck1 arrived at distributor0 at t=14).
Effects:
- crate5 is now in truck1.
- hoist3 releases crate5 and becomes available.
- truck1 load increases by crate5 weight (42): truck1 load 90 → 132.
- crate5 is not clear (inside truck).
- fuel-cost +1 → cumulative = 44.

t=17 — Step 18
Action: hoist5 puts crate0 down on crate4 at distributor2 (hoist5 holding crate0; crate4 is on pallet5 at distributor2).
Effects:
- crate0 is now on top of crate4 at distributor2.
- hoist5 releases crate0 and becomes available.
- crate0 becomes not clear (something placed on it? actually it is placed onto crate4, so crate0 is on crate4; crate0 may be clear or not depending on future actions — per domain putting down sets clear ?c true and clears surface false; step effects: crate0 becomes at distributor2, on crate4, clear; surface crate4 not clear).
- fuel-cost +1 → cumulative = 45.

t=18 — Step 19
Action: hoist3 takes crate2 out of truck1 at distributor0.
Effects:
- crate2 removed from truck1 and hoist3 is holding crate2; hoist3 becomes not available.
- truck1 load decreases by crate2 weight (74): truck1 load 132 → 58.
- fuel-cost +1 → cumulative = 46.

t=19 — Step 20
Action: hoist3 puts crate2 down on pallet3 at distributor0 (hoist3 holding crate2; pallet3 at distributor0).
Effects:
- crate2 is now on pallet3 at distributor0.
- hoist3 releases crate2 and becomes available.
- pallet3 becomes not clear.
- crate2 becomes at distributor0 and clear.
- fuel-cost +1 → cumulative = 47.

t=20 — Step 21
Action: truck1 drives from distributor0 to depot0.
Effects:
- truck1 location distributor0 → depot0.
- fuel-cost +10 → cumulative = 57.

t=21 — Step 22
Action: hoist0 places crate1 into truck1 at depot0 (hoist0 was holding crate1; truck1 now at depot0).
Effects:
- crate1 is now in truck1.
- hoist0 releases crate1 and becomes available.
- truck1 load increases by crate1 weight (72): truck1 load 58 → 130.
- crate1 is not clear (inside truck).
- fuel-cost +1 → cumulative = 58.

t=22 — Step 23
Action: hoist0 takes crate3 out of truck1 at depot0.
Effects:
- crate3 removed from truck1 and hoist0 is holding crate3; hoist0 becomes not available.
- truck1 load decreases by crate3 weight (16): truck1 load 130 → 114.
- fuel-cost +1 → cumulative = 59.

t=23 — Step 24 (final)
Action: hoist0 puts crate3 down on pallet0 at depot0 (hoist0 holding crate3; pallet0 at depot0).
Effects:
- crate3 is now on pallet0 at depot0 (goal stack for crate3 satisfied).
- hoist0 releases crate3 and becomes available.
- pallet0 becomes not clear.
- fuel-cost +1 → final cumulative = 60.

Final state (after t=23 / step 24):
- Goal conditions achieved:
  - crate0 on crate4 (crate0 placed on crate4 at t=17).
  - crate3 on pallet0 (crate3 placed on pallet0 at t=23).
  - crate2 on pallet3 (crate2 placed on pallet3 at t=19).
  - crate4 on pallet5 (crate4 placed on pallet5 at t=13).
- fuel-cost = 60 (minimized per given plan).
- truck0 final load = 0.
- truck1 final load = 114.
- All hoists available at the end.

Notes:
- All steps correspond exactly to the actions in the given plan in the same order and with the domain effects applied.
- Timestamps are sequential integers (t=0..23), each representing one atomic action; fuel-cost and truck loads are updated after each action according to the domain numeric effects.
