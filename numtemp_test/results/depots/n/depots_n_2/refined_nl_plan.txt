Notes:
- Each step mirrors the corresponding PDDL plan action in order and location.
- Timestamps are incremental estimates (1 unit per action) for readability; actual durations were not specified in the PDDL and are therefore approximated.
- Hoist actions (lift/putdown/load/unload) manipulate crate stacks or move crates into/out of trucks at the hoist's current place; drive actions move trucks between places.
