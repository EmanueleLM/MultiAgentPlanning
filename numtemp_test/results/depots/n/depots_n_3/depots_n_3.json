Encode capacity constraints for loading into trucks as numeric preconditions. Include actions: drive(truck, from, to), hoist-lift(hoist, crate, surface, place), hoist-put-down(hoist, crate, surface, place), hoist-put-in-truck(hoist, crate, truck, place), hoist-take-out-truck(hoist, crate, truck, place).
