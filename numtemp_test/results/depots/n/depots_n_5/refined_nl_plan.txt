Below is a human-readable, step-by-step execution of the provided PDDL plan. Each step follows the plan exactly and reports: the acting agent, the action taken (with objects and place), a short plain‑English description, and the fuel-cost increment caused by that action. For hoist load/unload actions I also report the truck load change when applicable (using the crate weights from the problem). I do not add or remove any actions; steps are listed sequentially as in the plan.

Note: fuel-cost increments — drive adds +10, any hoist action (lift/putdown/load/unload) adds +1.

This completes the sequence of actions given in the plan.

Summary notes:
- Every action listed above corresponds exactly to one action line in the provided plan and is presented in the same order.
- Fuel increments: each hoist action produced +1 fuel; each drive produced +10 fuel. (I reported +1 or +10 at each step.)
- Truck loads were tracked and reported for each hoist-load-into-truck and hoist-unload-from-truck action using the crate-weight values from the problem definition.
- The final step is the last action in the plan (hoist2 puts down crate12 onto crate14 at distributor1), which achieves the final on-relations required by the PDDL goal.

If you want, I can also:
- compute the total fuel-cost accumulated by summing all increments,
- produce timestamps or approximate durations for each step (e.g., assume 1 time unit per hoist action and 5 per drive), or
- present the same sequence grouped by agent (what each truck/hoist did). Which would you prefer?
