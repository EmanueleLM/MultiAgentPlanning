Summary of achieved final placements (as aimed by the plan):
- crate7 is placed on crate3 (step 26).
- crate3 is placed on crate8 (steps 25–27 collectively ensure crate3 on crate8 and crate8 on pallet6).
- crate4 is on pallet0 (step 18).
- crate6 is on pallet1 (step 21).
- crate2 remains on pallet4 (goal-aligned, no change needed).
- crate8 is on pallet6 (step 27).
- crate1 is on pallet7 (step 22).

Timing note: timestamps are sequential integer steps (t=0, t=1, …). Each step represents a single atomic action in the provided sequential plan. If durations are required, assume each atomic action takes one time unit.
