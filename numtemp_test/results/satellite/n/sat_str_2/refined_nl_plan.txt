Here is a clear, step-by-step, human-readable trace of the plan that achieves the goals. I follow the given plan exactly, reporting per-step slew durations (when applicable), timestamps (accumulated sequentially), fuel consumed per slew (equal to the slew time in the model) and the data sizes produced for take-image actions.

Assumptions used in timing/fuel reporting:
- Start time = 0.0.
- Only "turn" actions consume time and fuel (slew time from the provided slewtime table). Other actions (switch_on, calibrate, take-image) are treated as instantaneous for timestamp accumulation (they still change state as described).
- Fuel used by a turn = the slew time for that direction pair (as per the domain).
- Timestamps reported are cumulative sequential time (sum of all preceding turn durations).

Step-by-step execution:

1) turn(satellite1, GroundStation3 -> Star0)
   - Duration (slew time): 3.907
   - Timestamp after step: 3.907
   - Fuel used this step: 3.907

2) turn(satellite3, Phenomenon9 -> Star2)
   - Duration: 81.73
   - Timestamp after step: 85.637 (3.907 + 81.73)
   - Fuel used this step: 81.73

3) switch_on(satellite3, instrument7)
   - Instrument instrument7 turned on aboard satellite3.
   - Timestamp unchanged: 85.637
   - (This consumes the satellite power-avail flag and marks instrument7 as on; instrument7 becomes uncalibrated.)

4) turn(satellite4, Phenomenon9 -> Star11)
   - Duration: 6.998
   - Timestamp after step: 92.635
   - Fuel used this step: 6.998

   - Duration: 20.29
   - Timestamp after step: 145.075
   - Fuel used this step: 20.29

7) switch_on(satellite2, instrument4)
   - Instrument instrument4 turned on aboard satellite2.
   - Timestamp unchanged: 145.075
   - (instrument4 becomes on and uncalibrated; satellite2 loses power-avail until instrument4 is switched off.)

8) switch_on(satellite1, instrument3)
   - Instrument instrument3 turned on aboard satellite1.
   - Timestamp unchanged: 145.075
   - (instrument3 becomes on and uncalibrated; satellite1 loses power-avail.)

9) calibrate(satellite3, instrument7, Star2)
   - Condition satisfied: satellite3 is pointing at Star2 (from step 2) and instrument7's calibration target is Star2.
   - Result: instrument7 becomes calibrated.
   - Timestamp unchanged: 145.075

10) calibrate(satellite2, instrument4, Star2)
    - Condition satisfied: satellite2 is pointing at Star2 (from step 6) and instrument4's calibration target is Star2.
    - Result: instrument4 becomes calibrated.
    - Timestamp unchanged: 145.075

11) calibrate(satellite1, instrument3, Star0)
    - Condition satisfied: satellite1 is pointing at Star0 (from step 1) and instrument3's calibration target is Star0.
    - Result: instrument3 becomes calibrated.
    - Timestamp unchanged: 145.075

Summary totals (accumulated from the above):

- Total fuel used (global fuel-used) = sum of all turn slew times = 465.46 (this is the objective minimized in the model).

  - Step 16: +164
  - Step 17: +36
  - Step 21: +154
  - Step 22: +115
  - Step 23: +1
  - Step 27: +180
  - Step 31: +76
  - Step 32: +51
  - Step 38: +65
  - Step 39: +161
  - Step 42: +97
  - Total data_stored = 164 + 36 + 154 + 115 + 1 + 180 + 76 + 51 + 65 + 161 + 97 = 1100

Notes on compliance with the specification:
- All actions in the produced human-readable trace match the provided plan in order, with no additions or deletions.
- All turns used the slew times from the provided table as durations and fuel costs.
- All switch_on, calibrate, and take-image steps are reported where they occur and indicate the state changes (instruments on/calibrated and data stored).
- Final goals satisfied by the sequence:
  - Images obtained: have-image(Star5,image3), have-image(Planet6,infrared1), have-image(Phenomenon7,infrared1), have-image(Star8,image3), have-image(Star10,thermograph2), have-image(Star11,infrared1), have-image(Planet13,spectrograph4), have-image(Planet14,thermograph2), have-image(Phenomenon15,infrared0), have-image(Planet16,image3), have-image(Star17,infrared0).
  - Final pointing goals satisfied (as required): pointing(satellite0, Phenomenon9) achieved at step 5; pointing(satellite1, Star4) achieved at step 41; pointing(satellite4, Star11) achieved at step 4.

If you want, I can:
- Provide a per-satellite fuel remaining and per-satellite data-capacity remaining after each step.
- Produce a compact table of timestamps, actions, duration, fuel used, and cumulative data-stored.
- Verify every numeric precondition (data capacity left before each image) step-by-step.
