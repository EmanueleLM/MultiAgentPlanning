Notes:
- Actions are listed exactly as in the given plan, with their start times and durations. 
- Each action respects the domain constraints: switches on before calibrating, calibrates while pointed to the calibration target, turns take 5 time units (during which the satellite is not pointing), and take-image actions require the instrument to be powered and calibrated and the satellite to point at the target for the whole imaging duration. 
- All times reported are start times (as in the plan) and end times computed as start + duration.
