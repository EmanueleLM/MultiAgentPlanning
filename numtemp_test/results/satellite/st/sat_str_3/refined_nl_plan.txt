End result: the sequence of actions above follows the provided plan exactly (same actions, start times and durations). Each imaging action obtains the specified image at its action end; calibrations power and calibrate instruments as required; switch-on actions claimed power feeds and made instruments powered, and all turns respected the pointing semantics in the specification.
