Summary notes (how these steps satisfy the goals):
- The sequence follows the given plan timestamps and durations exactly.
- Switch-on/switch-off actions respect per-satellite shared power (an instrument switch-on claims power at start; switch-off releases at end).
- Turn actions make satellites unavailable for imaging/calibration while turning (satellites are “turning” during their turn durations).
- Calibrations occur while satellites are pointing (and stable) at the calibration target and instruments are powered for the whole calibration interval; instruments become calibrated at calibration end times.
- Take-image actions occur only while the satellite points steadily at the target and the instrument is powered and calibrated throughout the imaging interval; images are produced at the end of the take-image actions.
- The final action leaves satellite0 initiating a turn that will complete at time 88.0, placing satellite0 pointing at Planet21 as required by final_pointing for satellite0 in the specification (and other satellites reached their required final pointings at times consistent with the plan).

If you want, I can:
- convert this into a compact timeline per satellite (showing their activities over time),
- verify each precondition and effect formally against the PDDL domain/problem (cross-checking that all required preconditions were met when each action started), or
- produce a visualization of satellite/instrument resource usage over time. Which would you prefer next?
