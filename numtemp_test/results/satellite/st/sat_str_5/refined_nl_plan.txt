Notes on compliance with the specification:
- Each step above corresponds exactly to the actions, start times and durations in the provided plan.
- Turn actions represent satellites being unavailable for pointing during the turn (they stop pointing at start and resume pointing at the new direction at the end).
- switch_on actions claim satellite power at start and make instruments powered at end of their durations.
- calibrate and take_image actions require the satellite to be pointing at the calibration or imaging target for the action duration; instruments are marked "in-use" during calibrations and imaging and become calibrated or produce the image at the action end.
- All timestamps and durations are reported as in the plan; no extra actions were added or removed.
