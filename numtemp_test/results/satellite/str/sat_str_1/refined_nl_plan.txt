Final state note:
- After executing this exact sequence, the produced have_image facts and the pointing facts match the original plan's intent. The final-pointing goals specified in the original problem (for relevant satellites) are satisfied by the plan as provided (the plan preserves satellite1 pointing at Phenomenon19 per the problem’s final-pointing requirement and produces the required have_image facts listed in the problem goal).

If you want, I can:
- produce a compact checklist showing which goal images were achieved by which satellite/instrument step,
- or convert the timestamps into estimated durations (e.g., assign 1 unit per action) or real-time estimates.
