Notes:
- I followed the plan actions exactly and reported each as a readable step.
- Timestamps are illustrative (1-second increments) because the PDDL plan did not provide explicit durations. If you want realistic durations per action (e.g., slewing times or imaging times), provide those or request estimated durations and I can add them.
