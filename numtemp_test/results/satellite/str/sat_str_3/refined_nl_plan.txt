Below I translate the provided PDDL plan into a human-readable, step-by-step action sequence. Each step corresponds exactly to one action in the plan (no actions added or removed). I give a short natural-language description and an estimated timestamp assuming each action is one time unit long (t = 0, 1, 2, ...). Effects listed reflect the domain semantics (pointing changes with slews, switching on consumes the satellite power and clears calibration, calibrate requires pointing at the instrument's calibration target and the instrument on, take-image requires instrument on & calibrated & supporting the mode and satellite pointing at the target).

Timeline (each action ≈ 1 time unit):

1. t=0 — switch-on(satellite0, instrument2)
   - Turn on instrument2 aboard satellite0. Satellite0's power becomes unavailable; instrument2 becomes powered on and any previous calibration of instrument2 (if any) is cleared.

2. t=1 — slew(satellite0, star8, star4)
   - Slew satellite0 from pointing at Star8 to point at Star4. Satellite0 now points at Star4.

3. t=2 — switch-on(satellite3, instrument11)
   - Turn on instrument11 aboard satellite3. Satellite3's power becomes unavailable; instrument11 becomes powered on and any previous calibration of instrument11 is cleared.

   - Slew satellite3 from Phenomenon16 to point at Star1. Satellite3 now points at Star1.

Result: after step 36 the sequence has produced the set of have-image facts required by the problem:
- Phenomenon5 thermograph4 (step 23)
- Planet7 image1 (step 13)
- Star8 thermograph3 (step 15)
- Star9 image1 (step 19)
- Star10 image1 (step 24)
- Phenomenon13 thermograph2 (step 31)
- Star15 thermograph2 (step 34)
- Phenomenon17 thermograph4 (step 17)
- Phenomenon18 image1 (step 28)
- Planet19 thermograph2 (step 36)
- Planet20 thermograph4 (step 27)
- Phenomenon21 image1 (step 32)
- Star22 thermograph3 (step 21)

Notes on compliance:
- Each switch-on respects the "at most one instrument powered per satellite" constraint (power-available predicate becomes false on switch-on).
- Calibrations occur only when the satellite is pointing at the instrument's calibration target and the instrument is on.
- Each take-image occurs when instrument is on and calibrated, the instrument supports the requested mode, and the satellite is pointing at the target of the image.

If you want, I can produce a compact checklist showing which satellite and instrument achieved each goal image, or convert these steps into a table of timestamps, actors, preconditions and effects.
