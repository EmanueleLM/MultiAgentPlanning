Here is a human-readable, step-by-step rendering of the provided PDDL plan. Each step corresponds exactly to one action in the plan (no actions added or removed). I provide a timestamp for each action, assuming actions are executed sequentially and each action takes 1 time unit (timestamps are integer start times).

Notes about compliance with the specification:
- All actions are reported in the same order as the given plan with no additions or deletions.
- Each "switch-on" consumes the satellite's single power resource (prevents another instrument on that satellite from being on simultaneously until switched off).
- After switch-on, instruments are calibrated at calibration targets before any take-image actions using them.
- Each take-image occurs only when the satellite is pointing at the requested direction and the instrument is on, powered by that satellite, calibrated, and supports the requested mode.
- Final required pointings (in the PDDL problem) are satisfied for satellite7 (ends pointing at Star3). The plan also slews other satellites into positions needed to collect images as required by the goal set.

If you want, I can:
- Map each image result to the exact goal it satisfies, showing which goal lines are completed at which timestamp.
- Convert the timestamps to durations other than 1 time unit per action.
