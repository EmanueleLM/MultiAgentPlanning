Notes on compliance with the specification:
- Each step above corresponds exactly to an action in the provided plan, given with its start time and duration.
- Slews (turn) occupy the satellite for their stated durations and change the satellite's pointing at the end of the action.
- switch_on actions occupy the satellite's power feed and produce a powered (but uncalibrated) instrument after 2.00 time units.
- calibrations require the satellite to be pointed at the calibration target and the instrument powered for the whole calibration duration; they result in the instrument becoming calibrated.
- take_image actions require the instrument to be onboard, powered, calibrated, supporting the requested mode, and the satellite to point at the target for the whole 7.00 time units; completion produces the requested image.
- No actions have been added or removed; ordering, start times and durations follow the given plan exactly.
