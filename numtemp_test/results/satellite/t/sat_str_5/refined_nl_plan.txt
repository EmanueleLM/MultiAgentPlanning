Summary / final notes:
- Each step above corresponds exactly to an action in the provided plan, with the same start times and durations.
- The listed take_image actions produce the have-image facts at the indicated completion times.
- Calibrations and switch_on actions respect the required instrument power and pointing constraints during their durations.
- Slews (turns) occupy the satellite for their durations and leave the satellite pointing at the destination direction at the stated end time.
