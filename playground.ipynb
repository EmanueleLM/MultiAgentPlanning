      "   * Agent A is *not* able to grab the object that is inside the vault.  \n",
      "   * The problem statement says that *there may be another collaborative agent* in the environment – i.e., we are allowed to use that (unknown) agent to actually pick the object.\n",

      "   * The vault must be opened.  \n",

      "   *Open the vault* – carried out by Agent A.  \n",
      "   *Have a second agent pick or take the object* – carried out by the collaborative agent (denote it `?B`).  \n",

      "3. **Use the key to open the vault** – Once the key is in possession of the robot, the next logical action is to use it to open the vault.  \n",
      "4. **Enter the vault** – The vault entrance is small, so the robot must fit through; the action would be `enter‑vault`.  \n",
