A partial PDDL may partially solve a planning problem but it may require integration of information from the other PDDL to achieve the goal. Ambiguities may appear for example when two PDDL problems refer to the same object with different names. Here is the information the first agent has and its PDDL response To address the task, we'll create a PDDL domain and problem file reflecting the environment and rules provided.
