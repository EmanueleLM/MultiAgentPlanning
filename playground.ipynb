Keep in mind that the PDDL they send you may be partial or contain ambiguities.

Ambiguities may appear in different forms for example two PDDL problems may refer to the same object with different names. Here is the information the first agent has and its PDDL response To create a PDDL domain and problem for this scenario, we need to represent the actions of traveling between cities using direct flights and staying at each city.
