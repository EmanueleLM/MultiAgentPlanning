Below is a readable, step-by-step rendering of the provided PDDL plan. Each step matches the original plan exactly (no actions added/removed), reports the agent performing the action, and gives a timestamp and duration (1.0 time unit per action). I use uppercase block labels (A–K) to match the problem statement. At the end I confirm the final goal is achieved and report the total cost.

Assumptions adhered to: only the top block of a stack is moved; vowel_agent may only move A, E, I, O, U; consonant_agent may only move J, G, K, F, C, H, D, B.

Step 1 — Time 0.0 to 1.0 (duration 1.0)
- Agent: consonant_agent
- Action: move B from on I to the table
- Description: Consonant agent takes block B (top of stack on I) and places it onto the table.
- Result: B is on the table; I becomes clear.

Step 2 — Time 1.0 to 2.0 (duration 1.0)
- Agent: consonant_agent
- Action: move D from on H to on B
- Description: Consonant agent moves block D (top of H) and stacks it onto B.
- Result: D is on B; H becomes clear; B is no longer clear.

Step 3 — Time 2.0 to 3.0 (duration 1.0)
- Agent: consonant_agent
- Action: move H from on F to on I
- Description: Consonant agent takes H (top of F) and places it on I.
- Result: H is on I; F becomes clear; I is no longer clear.

Step 4 — Time 3.0 to 4.0 (duration 1.0)
- Agent: consonant_agent
- Action: move F from on K to on D
- Description: Consonant agent moves F (top of K) and stacks it onto D.
- Result: F is on D; K becomes clear; D is no longer clear.

Step 5 — Time 4.0 to 5.0 (duration 1.0)
- Agent: consonant_agent
- Action: move K from on J to the table
- Description: Consonant agent moves K (top of J) and places it onto the table.
- Result: K is on the table; J becomes clear.

Step 6 — Time 5.0 to 6.0 (duration 1.0)
- Agent: consonant_agent
- Action: move J from table to on K
- Description: Consonant agent picks up J from the table and places it on top of K.
- Result: J is on K; K is no longer clear; J is no longer on the table.

Step 7 — Time 6.0 to 7.0 (duration 1.0)
- Agent: consonant_agent
- Action: move H from on I to on F
- Description: Consonant agent picks up H (currently on I) and stacks it onto F.
- Result: H is on F; I becomes clear; F is no longer clear.

Step 8 — Time 7.0 to 8.0 (duration 1.0)
- Agent: vowel_agent
- Action: move I from on E to on J
- Description: Vowel agent moves I (a vowel block) from E and stacks it onto J.
- Result: I is on J; E becomes clear; J is no longer clear.

Step 9 — Time 8.0 to 9.0 (duration 1.0)
- Agent: consonant_agent
- Action: move H from on F to on I
- Description: Consonant agent moves H (top of F) and places it onto I.
- Result: H is on I; F becomes clear; I is no longer clear.

Step 10 — Time 9.0 to 10.0 (duration 1.0)
- Agent: vowel_agent
- Action: move E from on C to on F
- Description: Vowel agent moves E (a vowel block) from C and stacks it onto F.
- Result: E is on F; C becomes clear; F is no longer clear.

Step 11 — Time 10.0 to 11.0 (duration 1.0)
- Agent: consonant_agent
- Action: move C from on G to on E
- Description: Consonant agent moves C from G and stacks it onto E.
- Result: C is on E; G becomes clear; E is no longer clear.

Step 12 — Time 11.0 to 12.0 (duration 1.0)
- Agent: consonant_agent
- Action: move G from on A to on H
- Description: Consonant agent takes G (on A) and places it on H.
- Result: G is on H; A becomes clear; H is no longer clear.

Step 13 — Time 12.0 to 13.0 (duration 1.0)
- Agent: consonant_agent
- Action: move C from on E to the table
- Description: Consonant agent moves C (top of E) and places it onto the table.
- Result: C is on the table; E becomes clear.

Step 14 — Time 13.0 to 14.0 (duration 1.0)
- Agent: vowel_agent
- Action: move E from on F to on A
- Description: Vowel agent moves E (a vowel block) from F and stacks it onto A.
- Result: E is on A; F becomes clear; A is no longer clear.

Step 15 — Time 14.0 to 15.0 (duration 1.0)
- Agent: consonant_agent
- Action: move F from on D to on G
- Description: Consonant agent moves F (top of D) and places it onto G.
- Result: F is on G; D becomes clear; G is no longer clear.

Step 16 — Time 15.0 to 16.0 (duration 1.0)
- Agent: vowel_agent
- Action: move E from on A to on F
- Description: Vowel agent moves E (a vowel block) from A and stacks it onto F.
- Result: E is on F; A becomes clear; F is no longer clear.

Step 17 — Time 16.0 to 17.0 (duration 1.0)
- Agent: consonant_agent
- Action: move D from on B to on E
- Description: Consonant agent moves D (top of B) and places it onto E.
- Result: D is on E; B becomes clear; E is no longer clear.

Step 18 — Time 17.0 to 18.0 (duration 1.0)
- Agent: consonant_agent
- Action: move C from the table to on D
- Description: Consonant agent picks up C from the table and stacks it onto D.
- Result: C is on D; table position where C sat is now clear.

Step 19 — Time 18.0 to 19.0 (duration 1.0)
- Agent: consonant_agent
- Action: move B from the table to on C
- Description: Consonant agent picks up B from the table and stacks it onto C.
- Result: B is on C; table position where B sat is now clear.

Step 20 — Time 19.0 to 20.0 (duration 1.0)
- Agent: vowel_agent
- Action: move A from the table to on B
- Description: Vowel agent picks up A (a vowel block) from the table and places it on top of B.
- Result: A is on B; the table position where A sat is now clear.

Final state (after Time 20.0)
- The goal is achieved:
  - A on B
  - B on C
  - C on D
  - D on E
  - E on F
  - F on G
  - G on H
  - H on I
  - I on J
  - J on K
  - K on table
- Total plan cost: 20 (20 actions, unit cost each).

Notes:
- Each step follows the agents' constraints: vowel_agent moved only vowel blocks (A, E, I); consonant_agent moved only consonant blocks (B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K).
- Each move involved the top block of its source stack and one block at a time, as required.
