Assuming each action takes 1.0 time unit, start at t=0.0. Steps follow the given plan exactly.

1. t=0.0–1.0 — consonant_agent: move B from on top of G to the table.  
2. t=1.0–2.0 — consonant_agent: move D from on top of C onto E.  
3. t=2.0–3.0 — consonant_agent: move C from the table onto D.  
4. t=3.0–4.0 — consonant_agent: move B from the table onto C.  
5. t=4.0–5.0 — consonant_agent: move F from on top of H onto G.  
6. t=5.0–6.0 — consonant_agent: move F from on top of G to the table.  
7. t=6.0–7.0 — consonant_agent: move G from on top of I onto H.  
8. t=7.0–8.0 — consonant_agent: move F from the table onto G.  
9. t=8.0–9.0 — vowel_agent: move I from on top of J to the table.  
10. t=9.0–10.0 — consonant_agent: move J from on top of A to the table.  
11. t=10.0–11.0 — vowel_agent: move A from the table onto B.  
12. t=11.0–12.0 — vowel_agent: move I from the table onto J.  
13. t=12.0–13.0 — consonant_agent: move F from on top of G to the table.  
14. t=13.0–14.0 — consonant_agent: move G from on top of H to the table.  
15. t=14.0–15.0 — consonant_agent: move F from the table onto G.  
16. t=15.0–16.0 — consonant_agent: move H from the table onto I.  
17. t=16.0–17.0 — consonant_agent: move F from on top of G to the table.  
18. t=17.0–18.0 — consonant_agent: move G from the table onto H.  
19. t=18.0–19.0 — consonant_agent: move F from the table onto G.  
20. t=19.0–20.0 — vowel_agent: move A from on top of B to the table.  
21. t=20.0–21.0 — consonant_agent: move B from on top of C to the table.  
22. t=21.0–22.0 — vowel_agent: move A from the table onto B.  
23. t=22.0–23.0 — consonant_agent: move C from on top of D to the table.  
24. t=23.0–24.0 — consonant_agent: move D from on top of E to the table.  
25. t=24.0–25.0 — vowel_agent: move E from the table onto F.  
26. t=25.0–26.0 — consonant_agent: move D from the table onto E.  
27. t=26.0–27.0 — consonant_agent: move C from the table onto D.  
28. t=27.0–28.0 — vowel_agent: move A from on top of B to the table.  
29. t=28.0–29.0 — consonant_agent: move B from the table onto C.  
30. t=29.0–30.0 — vowel_agent: move A from the table onto B.

Result at t=30.0: final stack achieved — bottom J (on the table), then I, H, G, F, E, D, C, B, and A on top. Total plan cost / total time: 30 units.
