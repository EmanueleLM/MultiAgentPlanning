Final note: All actions above respect the agents' manipulation constraints (vowel_agent only moved A, E, I; consonant_agent moved the other blocks). After step 70 the plan achieves the specified global goal: a single tower with N on the table and the blocks above it in the order N M L K J I H G F E D C B A (A is the topmost block).
