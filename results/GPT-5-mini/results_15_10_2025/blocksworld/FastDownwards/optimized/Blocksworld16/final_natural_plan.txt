Assumptions: each action takes 1 second (unit duration). Timeline starts at t = 0 s. Agents: vowel_agent (moves vowels: A, E, I) and consonant_agent (moves consonants: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M). Actions are executed in the exact order of the given plan.

0s  — Step 1 — vowel_agent: Pick up A from on top of M.
1s  — Step 2 — consonant_agent: Pick up M from on top of I.
2s  — Step 3 — consonant_agent: Put down M onto the table.
3s  — Step 4 — consonant_agent: Pick up L from on top of G.
4s  — Step 5 — consonant_agent: Put down L on top of M.
5s  — Step 6 — vowel_agent: Put down A onto the table.
6s  — Step 7 — vowel_agent: Pick up I from on top of K.
7s  — Step 8 — consonant_agent: Pick up K from the table.
8s  — Step 9 — consonant_agent: Put down K on top of L.
9s  — Step 10 — consonant_agent: Pick up G from on top of F.
10s — Step 11 — consonant_agent: Put down G on top of A.
11s — Step 12 — consonant_agent: Pick up F from on top of J.
12s — Step 13 — consonant_agent: Put down F onto the table.
13s — Step 14 — consonant_agent: Pick up J from on top of E.
14s — Step 15 — consonant_agent: Put down J on top of K.
15s — Step 16 — consonant_agent: Pick up H from on top of D.
16s — Step 17 — vowel_agent: Put down I on top of J.
17s — Step 18 — vowel_agent: Pick up E from the table.
18s — Step 19 — consonant_agent: Put down H on top of I.
19s — Step 20 — consonant_agent: Pick up G from on top of A.
20s — Step 21 — consonant_agent: Put down G on top of H.
21s — Step 22 — consonant_agent: Pick up F from the table.
22s — Step 23 — consonant_agent: Put down F on top of G.
23s — Step 24 — consonant_agent: Pick up D from on top of C.
24s — Step 25 — vowel_agent: Put down E on top of F.
25s — Step 26 — vowel_agent: Pick up A from the table.
26s — Step 27 — consonant_agent: Put down D on top of E.
27s — Step 28 — consonant_agent: Pick up C from on top of B.
28s — Step 29 — consonant_agent: Put down C on top of D.
29s — Step 30 — consonant_agent: Pick up B from the table.
30s — Step 31 — consonant_agent: Put down B on top of C.
31s — Step 32 — vowel_agent: Put down A on top of B.

Completion: 32 actions executed, final time t = 32 s. Final configuration (top-to-bottom) satisfies the goal: A on B on C on D on E on F on G on H on I on J on K on L on M (with M on the table).
