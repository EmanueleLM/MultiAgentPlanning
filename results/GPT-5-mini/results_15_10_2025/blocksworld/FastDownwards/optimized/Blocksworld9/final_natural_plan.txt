Below is a step-by-step, human-readable execution of the provided PDDL plan. Each step matches the plan exactly (no actions added or removed). I report a simple timestamp assuming each action takes 1 second (start t = 0s). Agent names follow the specification: vowel_agent (v_ actions — can move A, E, I) and consonant_agent (c_ actions — moves consonants).

Step 1 — t = 0s (duration 1s): vowel_agent moves I from on top of B to on top of J.
