PROBLEM
------------------------------
You are an expert at scheduling meetings. You are given a few constraints on the existing schedule of each participant, the meeting duration, and possibly some preferences on the meeting time. Note there exists a solution that works with existing schedule of every participant.TASK: You need to schedule a meeting for Michelle, Steven and Jerry for one hour between the work hours of 9:00 to 17:00 on Monday. 

Here are the existing schedules for everyone during the day: 
Michelle has meetings on Monday during 11:00 to 12:00; 
Steven has blocked their calendar on Monday during 9:00 to 9:30, 11:30 to 12:00, 13:30 to 14:00, 15:30 to 16:00; 
Jerry has blocked their calendar on Monday during 9:00 to 9:30, 10:00 to 11:00, 11:30 to 12:30, 13:00 to 14:30, 15:30 to 16:00, 16:30 to 17:00; 

 Here is the proposed time: Monday, 14:30 - 15:30 Here is the proposed time: Monday, 14:30 - 15:30. Verify that the proposed time satisfies all the constraints or provide an alternative plan.

NATURAL-PLAN sas_plan_4
------------------------------
Step 1 — Schedule meeting (matches plan: (schedule t1430 t1500))
- Action: Schedule a one-hour meeting on Monday.
- Start time: 14:30 (t1430).
- End time: 15:30 (uses consecutive slots t1430 and t1500 → covers 14:30–15:30).
- Duration: 60 minutes.
- Participants: Michelle, Steven, Jerry.
- Note: This start time is within the 09:00–17:00 work window and was chosen because all three participants are free for the required consecutive half-hour slots that make up the one-hour meeting.
================================================================================


PROBLEM
------------------------------
You are an expert at scheduling meetings. You are given a few constraints on the existing schedule of each participant, the meeting duration, and possibly some preferences on the meeting time. Note there exists a solution that works with existing schedule of every participant.TASK: You need to schedule a meeting for Raymond, Billy and Donald for half an hour between the work hours of 9:00 to 17:00 on Monday. 

Here are the existing schedules for everyone during the day: 
Raymond has blocked their calendar on Monday during 9:00 to 9:30, 11:30 to 12:00, 13:00 to 13:30, 15:00 to 15:30; 
Billy has meetings on Monday during 10:00 to 10:30, 12:00 to 13:00, 16:30 to 17:00; 
Donald has meetings on Monday during 9:00 to 9:30, 10:00 to 11:00, 12:00 to 13:00, 14:00 to 14:30, 16:00 to 17:00; 

Billy would like to avoid more meetings on Monday after 15:00. Here is the proposed time: Monday, 14:30 - 15:00. Verify that the proposed time satisfies all the constraints or provide an alternative plan.

2) Donald accepts the 09:30 timeslot on Monday — meeting time: 09:30 to 10:00 (30 minutes).

3) Raymond accepts the 09:30 timeslot on Monday — meeting time: 09:30 to 10:00 (30 minutes).

PROBLEM
------------------------------
You are an expert at scheduling meetings. You are given a few constraints on the existing schedule of each participant, the meeting duration, and possibly some preferences on the meeting time. Note there exists a solution that works with existing schedule of every participant.TASK: You need to schedule a meeting for Roy, Kathryn and Amy for half an hour between the work hours of 9:00 to 17:00 on Monday. 

Here are the existing schedules for everyone during the day: 
Roy has blocked their calendar on Monday during 9:00 to 9:30, 10:00 to 10:30, 11:00 to 11:30, 12:30 to 13:00; 
Kathryn has meetings on Monday during 9:30 to 10:00, 16:30 to 17:00; 
Amy has blocked their calendar on Monday during 9:00 to 14:30, 15:00 to 16:00, 16:30 to 17:00; 

Amy would rather not meet on Monday after 15:30. Here is the proposed time: Monday, 14:30 - 15:00. Verify that the proposed time satisfies all the constraints or provide an alternative plan.

NATURAL-PLAN sas_plan_2
------------------------------
Step 1 — Schedule the meeting (14:30–15:00, Monday)
- Action taken: schedule s1430_1500
- Result: A 30-minute meeting is selected and marked scheduled for Monday 14:30–15:00.
- Participants: Roy, Kathryn, Amy
- Why this slot: all three participants are available at 14:30–15:00, and the slot ends before 15:30, so Amy’s preference to avoid meeting after 15:30 is satisfied.
