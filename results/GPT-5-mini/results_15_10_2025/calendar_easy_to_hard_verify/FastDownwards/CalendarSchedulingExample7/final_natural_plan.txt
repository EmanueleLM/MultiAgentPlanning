Step 1 — schedule-at slot7
- Action: Schedule the 30-minute meeting at slot7.
- Time (Monday): 12:00–12:30 (slot7 corresponds to 12:00–12:30).
- Duration: 30 minutes.
- Participants: Heather, Nicholas, Zachary.
- Rationale: All three participants are available at this slot; this respects Heather and Nicholas hard constraints and Zachary's preference (meeting is before 14:00).
- Effect: Meeting is scheduled at 12:00–12:30 and that slot is consumed for all participants.

Result: Goal achieved — a 30-minute meeting on Monday within 09:00–17:00 has been scheduled for Heather, Nicholas, and Zachary at 12:00–12:30.
