Step 1 — schedule slot_15_00
- Action: schedule(slot_15_00)
- Date: 2025-10-21
- Start time: 15:00
- End time: 15:30
- Duration: 30 minutes
- Participants: alice, bob, carol
- Effect: the meeting is scheduled (slot_15_00 marked scheduled, meeting-scheduled achieved)

Notes: This single action implements the plan’s solution — the 30-minute meeting is placed at 15:00–15:30 on 2025-10-21, which satisfies all participants’ availabilities and the tie-break preference to avoid interrupting Bob’s morning.
