Step 1 — Schedule the meeting
- Action (from plan): schedule-meeting t0900 t0900 t0900 michelle michelle michelle
- Human-readable: Schedule a one-hour meeting on Monday starting at 09:00 (09:00–10:00).
- Duration/timestamp: 60 minutes; start 09:00, end 10:00.
- Participants (as encoded in the plan): michelle (the plan's parameters use "michelle" for all participant slots).
- Effect: The planner marks the meeting as scheduled (meeting-scheduled) and records the meeting start at 09:00.

Note about consistency with the specification:
- The PDDL plan executed above contains a single scheduling action that achieves the goal predicate meeting-scheduled. However, it supplies "michelle" for every participant parameter in the action. That means the produced plan schedules the meeting (per the PDDL solution) but does not explicitly include steven or jerry as attendees. If the intended real-world requirement is a meeting that includes Michelle, Steven and Jerry, this plan does not enforce Steven’s and Jerry’s attendance; a different plan or domain encoding would be needed to guarantee all three are included.
