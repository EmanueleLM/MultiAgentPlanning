Summary: the following is a step-by-step, human-readable execution trace of the given plan applied to the provided initial state. Each step lists a timestamp (start time in arbitrary units), an assumed duration (1.0 unit each), the grounded action, the precondition check (which required facts were present), the effects (facts added and facts deleted), and the immediate resulting relevant changes. All preconditions were satisfied at the time of application. The final goal (next object_10 object_7, next object_11 object_7, next object_9 object_7) is achieved at the end.

Initial relevant facts (before step 1, from the problem):
- cats object_0
- collect object_5 object_1
- collect object_6 object_1
- collect object_7 object_2
- collect object_8 object_2
- hand object_10, hand object_11, hand object_9
- next object_0 object_5
- next object_10 object_8
- next object_11 object_6
- next object_3 object_5
- next object_4 object_7
- next object_9 object_5
- sneeze object_3, sneeze object_4
- spring object_5, spring object_7
- stupendous object_1, stupendous object_2
- texture object_5, texture object_6, texture object_7, texture object_8

Execution trace (each action duration = 1.0 time unit):

1) Time 0.0 → 1.0 : sip(object_9, object_0, object_5)
- Preconditions checked (all present): hand object_9; cats object_0; texture object_5; next object_9 object_5; next object_0 object_5.
- Effects:
  - Added: vase object_9 object_0
  - Deleted: next object_9 object_5
- Resulting immediate change: object_9 now holds vase(object_9,object_0); object_9 is no longer linked to object_5.

- Effects:
  - Added: next object_3 object_6
  - Deleted: next object_3 object_5
- Resulting immediate change: object_3's next changes from object_5 to object_6.

3) Time 2.0 → 3.0 : clip(object_11, object_3, object_6)

- Effects:
  - Added: vase object_11 object_0

- Effects:
  - Added: next object_0 object_7
  - Deleted: next object_0 object_5

8) Time 7.0 → 8.0 : paltry(object_9, object_0, object_7)

- Effects:
  - Added: next object_9 object_7

Final relevant state (after step 13):
- next object_10 object_7 (added at step 13)
- next object_11 object_7 (added at step 9)
- next object_9 object_7 (added at step 8)
=> The goal (next object_10 object_7 AND next object_11 object_7 AND next object_9 object_7) is satisfied.

Notes/assumptions:
- Each action was executed sequentially; I reported a simple uniform duration of 1.0 time unit per action and timestamps as cumulative start times.
- All preconditions used in checks were present in the initial state or were produced by earlier steps in the plan; no missing information was required.
- I reported only the directly relevant facts added/deleted by each action (vase and next facts and the predicates required in preconditions) rather than dumping the entire state each step. If you want the full complete state after each step (all predicates), I can provide that as well.
