Summary
- Initial notable facts: hand(object_11); sneeze(object_3), sneeze(object_4); texture(object_5,object_6,object_7,object_8,object_9,object_10); collect(object_10,object_2), collect(object_8,object_2), collect(object_9,object_2), …; next(object_0,object_5), next(object_11,object_8), next(object_3,object_5), next(object_4,object_10); stupendous(object_1), stupendous(object_2); spring(object_5), spring(object_8).
- Goal: next(object_11,object_9).
- Plan (4 actions, unit cost each). Each step shows timestamp (start→end, units arbitrary), which preconditions were checked, effects applied, and whether the step is valid.

Step 1 — time 0 → 1
Action: wretched object_4 object_10 object_8 object_2
- Grounding: (wretched ?o0=object_4 ?o1=object_10 ?o2=object_8 ?o3=object_2)
- Required preconditions:
  - sneeze(object_4) — present
  - texture(object_10) — present
  - texture(object_8) — present
  - stupendous(object_2) — present
  - next(object_4,object_10) — present
  - collect(object_10,object_2) — present
  - collect(object_8,object_2) — present
- All preconditions hold in the initial state → action applicable.
- Effects (applied):
  - Add: next(object_4,object_8)
  - Remove: next(object_4,object_10)
- Resulting changes to key facts: next(object_4,object_10) is deleted; next(object_4,object_8) is added.

Step 2 — time 1 → 2
Action: clip object_11 object_4 object_8
- Grounding: (clip ?o0=object_11 ?o1=object_4 ?o2=object_8)
- Required preconditions:
  - hand(object_11) — present
  - sneeze(object_4) — present
  - texture(object_8) — present
  - next(object_4,object_8) — present (added by Step 1)
  - next(object_11,object_8) — present (initial)
- All preconditions hold → action applicable.
- Effects (applied):
  - Add: vase(object_11,object_4)
  - Remove: next(object_11,object_8)
- Resulting changes: next(object_11,object_8) is deleted; vase(object_11,object_4) is added.

Step 3 — time 2 → 3
Action: wretched object_4 object_8 object_9 object_2
- Grounding: (wretched ?o0=object_4 ?o1=object_8 ?o2=object_9 ?o3=object_2)
- Required preconditions:
  - sneeze(object_4) — present
  - texture(object_8) — present
  - texture(object_9) — present
  - stupendous(object_2) — present
  - next(object_4,object_8) — present (from Step 1; not yet removed by any intervening step)
  - collect(object_8,object_2) — present (initial)
  - collect(object_9,object_2) — present (initial)
- All preconditions hold → action applicable.
- Effects (applied):
  - Add: next(object_4,object_9)
  - Remove: next(object_4,object_8)
- Resulting changes: next(object_4,object_8) is deleted; next(object_4,object_9) is added.

Step 4 — time 3 → 4
Action: tightfisted object_11 object_4 object_9
- Grounding: (tightfisted ?o0=object_11 ?o1=object_4 ?o2=object_9)
- Required preconditions:
  - hand(object_11) — present
  - sneeze(object_4) — present
  - texture(object_9) — present
  - next(object_4,object_9) — present (added by Step 3)
  - vase(object_11,object_4) — present (added by Step 2)
- All preconditions hold → action applicable.
- Effects (applied):
  - Add: next(object_11,object_9)
  - Remove: vase(object_11,object_4)
- Resulting changes: next(object_11,object_9) is added (this is the goal); vase(object_11,object_4) is removed.

Conclusion
- Every action in the provided plan is applicable when executed in the given order; each step's preconditions are satisfied at its time of execution.
- The final effect of Step 4 produces next(object_11,object_9), which meets the goal.
- Plan validity: valid. Total cost (unit cost per action): 4. Total duration (as reported): 4 time units (0→4).
