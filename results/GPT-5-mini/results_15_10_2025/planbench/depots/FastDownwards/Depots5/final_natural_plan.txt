Summary: The following is a step-by-step, human-readable trace of the supplied PDDL plan. Each step shows the action, its parameters, which preconditions are being used (from the current state), the state change (effects), an estimated timestamp/duration (1 time unit per action), and a short note on whether the preconditions hold. The trace follows the plan exactly and ends by confirming the requested goals are achieved.

Assumed start time t = 0.0. Each action is treated as taking 1.0 time unit. Total cost = 8.

1) t = 0.0 → 1.0
Action: clip object_9 object_4 object_7
- Meaning (from domain): With hand = object_9 and sneeze = object_4 and texture = object_7, if next(object_4, object_7) and next(object_9, object_7) hold, create vase(object_9, object_4) and remove next(object_9, object_7).
- Preconditions used: hand(object_9), sneeze(object_4), texture(object_7), next(object_4,object_7), next(object_9,object_7).
- Are preconditions satisfied now? Yes (next object_4 object_7 and next object_9 object_7 are present initially).
- Effects (state change): add (vase object_9 object_4); delete (next object_9 object_7).
- Note: After this step next(9,7) is removed; vase(9,4) appears.

2) t = 1.0 → 2.0
Action: tightfisted object_9 object_4 object_8
- Meaning: With hand = object_9, sneeze = object_4, texture = object_8, if next(object_4,object_8) and vase(object_9,object_4) hold, produce next(object_9,object_8) and remove vase(object_9,object_4).
- Preconditions used: hand(object_9), sneeze(object_4), texture(object_8), next(object_4,object_8), vase(object_9,object_4).
- Are preconditions satisfied now? Yes (next object_4 object_8 was in the initial state; vase(9,4) was created in step 1).
- Effects: add (next object_9 object_8); delete (vase object_9 object_4).
- Note: After this step next(9,8) exists (goal-relevant).

3) t = 2.0 → 3.0
Action: wretched object_3 object_5 object_6 object_1
- Meaning: With sneeze = object_3, textures = object_5 & object_6, stupendous = object_1, if next(object_3,object_5) and collect(object_5,object_1) and collect(object_6,object_1) hold, change next(object_3,object_5) into next(object_3,object_6) (i.e., add next(3,6) and remove next(3,5)).
- Preconditions used: sneeze(object_3), texture(object_5), texture(object_6), stupendous(object_1), next(object_3,object_5), collect(object_5,object_1), collect(object_6,object_1).
- Are preconditions satisfied now? Yes (these facts are present in the initial state).
- Effects: add (next object_3 object_6); delete (next object_3 object_5).
- Note: Next link for object_3 moves from object_5 to object_6.

4) t = 3.0 → 4.0
Action: clip object_9 object_3 object_6
- Meaning: With hand = object_9 and sneeze = object_3 and texture = object_6, if next(object_3,object_6) and next(object_9,object_6) hold, create vase(object_9,object_3) and remove next(object_9,object_6).
- Preconditions used: hand(object_9), sneeze(object_3), texture(object_6), next(object_3,object_6), next(object_9,object_6).
- Are preconditions satisfied now? Yes (next(3,6) was added in step 3; next(9,6) existed initially).
- Effects: add (vase object_9 object_3); delete (next object_9 object_6).
- Note: vase(9,3) appears; next(9,6) is removed.

5) t = 4.0 → 5.0
Action: wretched object_3 object_6 object_5 object_1
- Meaning: With sneeze = object_3, textures = object_6 & object_5, stupendous = object_1, if next(object_3,object_6) and collect(object_6,object_1) and collect(object_5,object_1) hold, change next(object_3,object_6) into next(object_3,object_5).
- Preconditions used: sneeze(object_3), texture(object_6), texture(object_5), stupendous(object_1), next(object_3,object_6), collect(object_6,object_1), collect(object_5,object_1).
- Are preconditions satisfied now? Yes (next(3,6) exists from step 3; collect facts were initial).
- Effects: add (next object_3 object_5); delete (next object_3 object_6).
- Note: This reverts object_3’s next link back to object_5.

6) t = 5.0 → 6.0
Action: tightfisted object_9 object_3 object_5
- Meaning: With hand = object_9, sneeze = object_3, texture = object_5, if next(object_3,object_5) and vase(object_9,object_3) hold, produce next(object_9,object_5) and remove vase(object_9,object_3).
- Preconditions used: hand(object_9), sneeze(object_3), texture(object_5), next(object_3,object_5), vase(object_9,object_3).
- Are preconditions satisfied now? Yes (next(3,5) was restored in step 5; vase(9,3) created in step 4).
- Effects: add (next object_9 object_5); delete (vase object_9 object_3).
- Note: next(9,5) now exists.

7) t = 6.0 → 7.0
Action: sip object_9 object_0 object_5
- Meaning: With hand = object_9 and cats = object_0 and texture = object_5, if next(object_9,object_5) and next(object_0,object_5) hold, create vase(object_9,object_0) and remove next(object_9,object_5).
- Preconditions used: hand(object_9), cats(object_0), texture(object_5), next(object_9,object_5), next(object_0,object_5).
- Are preconditions satisfied now? Yes (next(9,5) from step 6; next(0,5) was in initial state).
- Effects: add (vase object_9 object_0); delete (next object_9 object_5).
- Note: vase(9,0) appears.

8) t = 7.0 → 8.0
Action: paltry object_9 object_0 object_7
- Meaning: With hand = object_9 and cats = object_0 and texture = object_7, if vase(object_9,object_0) and next(object_0,object_7) hold, create next(object_9,object_7) and remove vase(object_9,object_0).
- Preconditions used: hand(object_9), cats(object_0), texture(object_7), vase(object_9,object_0), next(object_0,object_7).
- Are preconditions satisfied now? Yes (vase(9,0) was created in step 7; next(0,7) was present initially).
- Effects: add (next object_9 object_7); delete (vase object_9 object_0).
- Note: next(9,7) is restored/created.

Final state relevant facts (after step 8)
- next(object_9, object_8) — created in step 2
- next(object_9, object_7) — created in step 8

Goal check
- Required goal: (next object_9 object_8) and (next object_9 object_7).
- Both are present in the final state (see notes above). Therefore the plan achieves the goal.

Total plan duration (estimated): 8.0 time units
Total cost (as given): 8
