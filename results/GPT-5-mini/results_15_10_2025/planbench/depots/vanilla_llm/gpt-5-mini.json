But having next(object_4, object_8) alone does not help because creating the required vase object_9,object_4 (to use tightfisted) still requires sip/clip which both need next(object_9, object_8), so that path is circular.\n\nConclusion: every way to make next(object_9, object_8) either requires cats or sneeze for object_9 (which cannot be created) or requires next(object_9, object_8) itself to create auxiliary facts (circular).

    "response": "I examined the domain and the second problem instance. Short answer: there is no valid plan that achieves next object_10 object_6 from the given initial facts. Below is a concise proof/explanation.\n\nKey observations about how next object_10 object_6 could ever be produced\n- The only actions that can add a next fact of the form next o0 o2 are:\n  - paltry(o0, o1, o2) \u2014 requires hand o0, cats o1, texture o2, vase o0 o1, next o1 o2\n  - tightfisted(o0, o1, o2) \u2014 requires hand o0, sneeze o1, texture o2, next o1 o2, vase o0 o1\n  - memory(o0, o1, o2) \u2014 requires cats o0, spring o1, spring o2, next o0 o1\n  - wretched(o0, o1, o2, o3) \u2014 requires sneeze o0, texture o1, texture o2, stupendous o3, next o0 o1, collect o1 o3, collect o2 o3\n\nTo create next object_10 object_6, some action above must be applied with o0 = object_10.\n\nWhy memory and wretched cannot be used with o0 = object_10\n- memory requires cats object_10. The initial facts include cats only for object_0 and object_1; no action in this domain ever adds a cats fact. So memory(object_10, \u2026) is impossible.\n- wretched requires sneeze object_10. The initial sneeze facts are only for object_4 and object_5; no action ever adds sneeze. So wretched(object_10, \u2026) is impossible.\n\nThat leaves paltry and tightfisted, which both require vase object_10 X for some X\n- So we must create some vase object_10 X. The only actions that add a vase fact are clip and sip (both add vase o0 o1).\n- Both clip and sip require next object_10 Y in their preconditions (clip needs next o0 o2, sip needs next o0 o2). That means to create any vase(10,\u00b7) via clip/sip we already must have some next object_10 Y true.\n\nWhich next facts with subject 10 are available initially?\n- The initial state contains next object_10 object_9 (only next with subject 10 is next 10 9).\n\nThus the only usable clip/sip to create any vase(10,\u00b7) must use next10 9 as the required next fact. Check what is possible:\n- clip(10,5,9) is applicable in the initial state: hand 10, sneeze 5, texture 9, next 5 9, next 10 9 are all true. That yields vase 10 5 (and deletes next 10 9).\n- sip(10,1,9) would require cats 1, texture 9, next 10 9, next 1 9 \u2014 but next 1 9 is not in the initial facts, so sip variants are not generally available except where both next(10,9) and next(1,9) hold.\n\nSo the only vase for object_10 we can plausibly create is vase(10,5) (by clip(10,5,9)).\n\nCan we then use paltry or tightfisted with vase(10,5) to make next 10 6?\n- paltry(10, o1, o2) requires cats(o1). cats is true only for object_0 and object_1, not for object_5, so paltry cannot use o1 = 5. To use paltry to add next 10 6 we would need vase(10,1) or vase(10,0), which we cannot create without already having a different next(10,\u00b7) that we do not have.\n- tightfisted(10,5,6) would require next 5 6 in addition to vase 10 5. So the question reduces to: can we make next 5 6?\n\nCan we create next 5 6?\n- next 5 6 could be added by wretched(5,9,6,o3) (because next 5 9 is initially true), but wretched requires collect 9 o3 and collect 6 o3 for the same o3. The initial collect facts are:\n  - collect 6 2\n  - collect 7 2\n  - collect 8 3\n  - collect 9 3\n  There is no o3 that both collect 9 o3 and collect 6 o3 hold for the same o3 \u2014 they point to different collect targets (9 \u2192 3, 6 \u2192 2). No action in the domain adds collect facts. So wretched cannot produce next 5 6.\n- memory(5, \u2026) requires cats(5) which does not hold and cannot be created.\n- paltry(5, \u2026) would require vase(5,\u00b7) and cats(\u00b7) etc., but even if vase(5,\u00b7) were created, paltry would require cats for the intermediary which is not available for 5 as needed.\n\nTherefore next 5 6 is not reachable with the actions available and the given collect facts.\n\nConclusion\n- memory and wretched with o0 = object_10 are impossible because object_10 lacks cats and sneeze and nothing can add them.\n- paltry/tightfisted can only succeed if a suitable vase(10, X) is available; vase(10, X) can only be created by clip/sip and those require an existing next(10, Y). The only initial next(10, \u00b7) is next(10,9), so the only vase we can make is vase(10,5) via clip(10,5,9).\n- With vase(10,5) the only applicable tightfisted possibility requires next(5,6), but next(5,6) cannot be produced given the collect facts (no common collect target to support the necessary wretched), and memory/paltry routes are blocked by missing cats on relevant objects.\nHence no sequence of actions from the initial state can produce next object_10 object_6.\n\nIf you want, I can:\n- produce the best partial plan fragments (for example clip(10,5,9) is applicable) and show exactly where the plan gets stuck; or\n- try variants if you can change initial facts (e.g., add cats object_10 or add a collect linking 6 and 9 under the same o3), in which case I can produce a working plan."

    "response": "Short answer: The full goal (next object_10 object_8, next object_11 object_7, and next object_9 object_6) is impossible from the given initial state. I can, however, give a correct sequence that achieves next_10\u21928 and next_11\u21927; the third target next_9\u21926 cannot be reached because of irreconcilable precondition requirements (explained below).\n\nWhy next_9\u21926 is impossible\n- The only actions that can establish next for a hand subject (like object_9) are paltry and tightfisted.\n  - paltry(9, 0, 6) would require next(0,6) true. The only action that changes next for object_0 is memory(object_0, p, q), which can only set next(0,q) when p and q are springs. The only spring objects are 5 and 7, so memory can only produce next(0,5) or next(0,7) \u2014 never next(0,6). So paltry cannot produce next(9,6).\n  - tightfisted(9, s, 6) would require (a) some sneeze s with next(s,6) true (the only such is s=3, since next(3,6) is initial), and (b) vase(9,s) true. To get vase(9,3) you would need to use clip(9,3,b), but clip(9,3,b) requires next(9,b) already true (and next(3,b) true). For b=6 you would already need next(9,6) true \u2014 circular. For any other b where next(3,b) is true you either do not have such b or cannot create it. So you cannot create vase(9,3) without already having next(9,6). Therefore tightfisted cannot produce next(9,6) either.\n- Because both ways to create next(9,6) are blocked (paltry requires next(0,6) impossible; tightfisted requires vase(9,3) which is circular), next(9,6) is unreachable from the initial facts.\n\nValid partial plan that achieves the other two goals\nThe following sequence is valid and ends with next(10,8) and next(11,7). It cannot produce next(9,6) for the reasons above.\n\n1) sip object_10 object_0 object_5\n   - pre: hand10, cats0, texture5, next10 5, next0 5 (all true initially)\n   - effect: vase10 0 becomes true; next10 5 becomes false\n\n2) sip object_11 object_0 object_5\n   - effect: vase11 0 becomes true; next11 5 becomes false\n\n3) memory object_0 object_5 object_7\n   - pre: cats0, spring5, spring7, next0 5 (next0 5 still true)\n   - effect: next0 7 becomes true; next0 5 becomes false\n\n4) paltry object_11 object_0 object_7\n   - pre: hand11, cats0, texture7, vase11 0 (set in step 2), next0 7 (set in step 3)\n   - effect: next11 7 becomes true; vase11 0 becomes false\n\n5) paltry object_10 object_0 object_7\n   - pre: hand10, cats0, texture7, vase10 0 (set in step 1), next0 7\n   - effect: next10 7 becomes true; vase10 0 becomes false\n\n6) clip object_10 object_4 object_7\n   - pre: hand10, sneeze4, texture7, next4 7 (initial), next10 7 (set in step 5)\n   - effect: vase10 4 becomes true; next10 7 becomes false\n\n7) wretched object_4 object_7 object_8 object_2\n   - pre: sneeze4, texture7, texture8, stupendous2, next4 7, collect7 2, collect8 2 (all satisfied initially)\n   - effect: next4 8 becomes true; next4 7 becomes false\n\n8) tightfisted object_10 object_4 object_8\n   - pre: hand10, sneeze4, texture8, next4 8 (set in step 7), vase10 4 (set in step 6)\n   - effect: next10 8 becomes true; vase10 4 becomes false\n\nResult after these steps:\n- next(object_10, object_8) is true (goal achieved)\n- next(object_11, object_7) is true (goal achieved)\n- next(object_9, object_6) is still not true (unreachable as argued)\n\nConclusion\n- The two goals next object_10 object_8 and next object_11 object_7 are achievable; the plan above achieves them.\n- The third goal next object_9 object_6 is impossible from the given initial facts and action definitions (no sequence of actions can produce it because of the circular / missing preconditions described).\n\nIf you want, I can:\n- Output the above plan in a different format,\n- Search for any alternative sequences reaching the two achievable goals (there are variants), or\n- Re-check if I missed any action interpretation you intended (e.g., if collect/spring/stupendous sets differ), which might make next_9\u21926 reachable."

    "response": "Short answer: From the second initial state you gave, the triple goal (next 10 7, next 11 7, next 12 7) is not reachable. You can make next 12 7, but next 10 7 and next 11 7 cannot be achieved under the given action preconditions.\n\nWhy (concise proof sketch / key invariants)\n- Only actions that create a vase(a,b) are:\n  - sip(a,b,c) \u2014 requires cats(b)\n  - clip(a,b,c) \u2014 requires sneeze(b)\n  Thus vase(a,b) can only ever be created for b that are either cat-objects (0 or 1 here) via sip, or sneeze-objects (4 or 5 here) via clip.\n- To get next(subject, 7) for subject in {10,11,12} we need some action that produces next subject 7:\n  - paltry(a,b,7) requires vase(a,b) and next(b,7)\n  - tightfisted(a,b,7) requires vase(a,b) and next(b,7) and sneeze(b)\n  - clip and sip do not directly create next a 7 (they create vases), memory/wretched create next only for subjects that satisfy their preconditions (memory requires cats(subject); wretched requires sneeze(subject)).\n  So, for subject \u2208 {10,11,12} (none are cats or sneeze), the only way to give them next ... 7 is via paltry or tightfisted, and that requires vase(subject, b) and next(b,7).\n- Which b can have next(b,7)?\n  - Only object_4 can be made to have next(...,7) from its initial next 6, using wretched(4,6,7,2) \u2014 because 4 is a sneeze-object and collects for 6 and 7 align (both collect to stupendous 2).\n  - Object_5 cannot be made to point to 7 (its collect partners map to stupendous 3, so it can only switch between 8 and 9).\n  - Objects 0 and 1 cannot be wretched (they lack sneeze), and changing them to point to 7 is not possible with the available preconditions (no suitable stupendous/collect alignment).\n  => therefore the only usable b that can provide next(b,7) is b = object_4.\n- So for each subject a \u2208 {10,11,12} we need vase(a,4). How can we create vase(a,4)?\n  - Only clip(a,4,c) can create vase(a,4) because sip requires cats(4) (false).\n  - clip(a,4,c) requires next a c and next 4 c simultaneously (and sneeze 4 and texture c).\n  - next 4 initially is 6 (it can become 7 later via wretched). So clip(a,4,6) is the candidate; that requires next a 6 as a precondition.\n  - Initially next12 6 is true so clip(12,4,6) is possible; next10 6 and next11 6 are not true and there is no action available that changes next10 or next11 to 6 (memory would, but it requires cats(10) or cats(11) which are false; wretched would, but it requires sneeze(subject) which is false for 10 and 11). Thus you cannot make next10 6 or next11 6, so you cannot perform clip(10,4,6) or clip(11,4,6) to obtain vase(10,4) or vase(11,4).\nConclusion: vase(12,4) is obtainable, but vase(10,4) and vase(11,4) are not, so you cannot produce next 10 7 or next 11 7.\n\nFeasible partial plan (makes next 12 7)\n1. clip object_12 object_4 object_6\n   - pre: hand12, sneeze4, texture6, next4 6, next12 6 \u2014 all true initially\n   - effect: vase(12,4) becomes true, next12 6 is deleted\n2. wretched object_4 object_6 object_7 object_2\n   - pre: sneeze4, texture6, texture7, stupendous2, next4 6, collect6 2, collect7 2 \u2014 all true initially\n   - effect: next4 7 becomes true (next4 6 deleted)\n   - Note: Do clip(12,4,6) before this wretched, because wretched would delete next4 6 which clip needs.\n3. tightfisted object_12 object_4 object_7\n   - pre: hand12, sneeze4, texture7, next4 7, vase12 4 \u2014 now true after steps 1\u20132\n   - effect: next12 7 becomes true (vase12 4 deleted)\n\nAfter these three steps you have next 12 7. The other two goals (next 10 7 and next 11 7) remain unreachable for the reasons above.\n\nIf you want to make the full triple goal reachable, you need to change the domain or starters:\n- Add cats(object_10) and/or cats(object_11) so memory-based moves become possible for them; or\n- Give sneeze(object_10) and/or sneeze(object_11) so wretched can act on them; or\n- Add or change collect/stupendous facts so some b other than 4 can be made to point to 7 while that b also matches next of 10/11 so clip can create vase(10,b) / vase(11,b).\nIf you tell me which initial facts you are allowed to change (e.g., add cats/sneeze to some objects or modify collects), I can produce a full plan achieving all three goals."

    "response": "I checked the available actions and the initial facts you gave for the second problem and I could not find any valid action sequence that achieves all four goal facts. In fact some individual goal facts are unreachable from the given initial state because every operator that would change that object's current next would require preconditions that never become true.\n\nSummary of why the goal is unreachable\n\n- General observation: every operator that changes \"next X Y\" to \"next X Z\" requires that the specific \"next X Y\" is present (it is) and then one of a small set of patterns must hold:\n  - memory(X,Y,Z) needs cats(X) and spring(Y) and spring(Z);\n  - wretched(X,Y,Z,D) needs sneeze(X) (and collect constraints for Y and Z);\n  - paltry(X,Y,Z) needs vase(X,Y) and cats(Y);\n  - tightfisted(X,Y,Z) needs vase(X,Y) and sneeze(Y);\n  - (sip/clip produce/delete vase or next in certain patterns but require other preconditions).\n  So to change next for an object X you must be able to satisfy one of those patterns for that X.\n\n- next object_11 object_7 (i.e. change next11 from 5 \u2192 7)\n  - memory(11,5,7) would require cats(11) \u2014 not present and there is no operator that can add cats(11).\n  - wretched(11,5,7,...) would require sneeze(11) \u2014 not present and there is no operator that can add sneeze(11).\n  - paltry(11,5,7) would require vase(11,5) and cats(5) \u2014 cats(5) is not true and there is no way to make cats(5).\n  - tightfisted(11,5,7) would require vase(11,5) and sneeze(5) \u2014 sneeze(5) is not true and there is no operator to make sneeze(5).\n  - You can create a vase(11,3) by clip(11,3,5) (since sneeze(3) and next3=5 are present), but then to use that vase to get next11=7 you would need tightfisted(11,3,7), which needs next3=7. next3 is initially 5; making next3=7 would require wretched(3,5,7,...) which needs collect(5,D) and collect(7,D) for the same D \u2014 those collect facts are different in the initial state, so next3\u21927 cannot be obtained. Therefore next11=7 is not achievable.\n\n- next object_12 object_7 (change next12 from 6 \u2192 7)\n  - memory(12,6,7) needs cats(12) \u2014 not present.\n  - wretched(12,6,7,...) needs sneeze(12) \u2014 not present.\n  - tightfisted/paltry would require making a suitable vase(12,\u2026) and a sneeze or cats precondition; while you can create some vase(12,3) by clip(12,3,6) after making next3=6, to then get next12=7 you would need next3=7 (for tightfisted(12,3,7)) or other preconditions that again reduce to the same impossibility for making next3=7 (see previous point). So next12=7 is not reachable.\n\n- next object_9 object_6 (change next9 from 7 \u2192 6)\n  - memory(9,7,6) needs cats(9) \u2014 not present.\n  - wretched(9,7,6,...) needs sneeze(9) \u2014 not present.\n  - paltry/tightfisted approaches need vase(9,...) and either cats of the intermediate or sneeze of the intermediate; creating vase(9,3) would require next3=6 and next9=6 simultaneously to use clip(9,3,6) (clip requires next9=6 pre), which is circular. There is no available path to make sneeze(9) or cats(9) or produce next3=7 (see above), so next9=6 is not achievable.\n\n- next object_10 object_6 (change next10 from 8 \u2192 6)\n  - memory(10,8,6) needs cats(10) \u2014 not present.\n  - wretched(10,8,6,...) needs sneeze(10) \u2014 not present.\n  - You can create vase(10,4) by clip(10,4,8) (those preconditions are present) and you can make next4=7 or next4=6 by wretched depending on collects, but to get next10=6 via tightfisted(10,4,6) you need next4=6. Making next4=6 would require a wretched(4,8,6,...) that requires both collect(8,D) and collect(6,D) for the same D \u2014 but the available collects are collect(8,2) and collect(6,1), so there is no common D and thus next4\u21926 cannot be obtained. Therefore next10=6 cannot be obtained.\n\nBecause each of the four required next-changes has no feasible operator chain from the initial facts (they all require either cats or sneeze on the target hand object, or require changing a sneeze-object\u2019s successor in ways blocked by collect mismatches), the overall goal set {next10 6, next11 7, next12 7, next9 6} is unreachable from the given initial state.\n\nIf you want, I can:\n- produce a maximal partial plan that achieves some reachable subgoals (e.g. change next3\u21926 or next4\u21927 are achievable), or\n- attempt to synthesize a plan after you modify the initial state (for example: give cats for some hand object(s), add a sneeze for one of the hands, or add/align collect facts so wretched can change sneeze-object successors). Tell me which changes you\u2019re willing to make and I\u2019ll produce a valid plan."

    "response": "Short answer: There is no valid plan that achieves the requested goal (next 10 8, next 11 6, next 12 8, next 9 5) from the given initial state and operators.\n\nReasoning (concise invariant-based proof):\n\n1) Partition of the \"next-target\" domain by the collect facts\n- collect pairs present: collect(5,1), collect(6,1) and collect(7,2), collect(8,2).\n- Any wretched step can replace next(o, a) by next(o, b) only when collect(a, t) and collect(b, t) for the same t. That means wretched can only move a next-target within the set {5,6} (both collect to 1) or within the set {7,8} (both collect to 2). So wretched preserves the \"group\" {5,6} vs {7,8} of a next-target.\n\n2) Other next-creating actions and their constraints\n- memory can add next(o, x) only when o is the cats object (object_0); its two spring parameters are spring objects 5 and 7, so memory for object_0 can only move object_0's next between 5 and 7 (it cannot produce 6 or 8).\n- paltry and sip require that the second parameter is a cats object (the specification uses \"cats object_1\"), and cats is true only for object_0 in the initial state. So paltry/sip are always of the form paltry(X, 0, Y) or sip(X, 0, Y) \u2014 they cannot be used with arbitrary middle objects to cross groups.\n- clip and tightfisted require that the second parameter is a sneeze object; sneeze is true only for objects 3 and 4. Those sneeze objects can have their next-target moved only within their current collect-group (by wretched) unless they are object_0 (they are not).\n\n3) Consequence for reachability (key invariant)\n- Any object whose current next-target lies in group {5,6} can only ever have its next-target in {5,6} (except object_0 which can be moved between 5 and 7 by memory, but not to 6 or 8).\n- Any object whose current next-target lies in group {7,8} can only ever have its next-target in {7,8}.\n- The only cross-group movement that memory can effect is for object_0 (and only between 5 and 7).\n\n4) Apply the invariant to the requested goal\n- Initial nexts:\n  - next(10) = 7 (group {7,8})\n  - next(11) = 8 (group {7,8})\n  - next(12) = 5 (group {5,6})\n  - next(9)  = 8 (group {7,8})\n- Goal nexts:\n  - next(10) = 8 (still in {7,8}) \u2014 this one stays in the same group, so it is not ruled out by the group invariant alone.\n  - next(11) = 6 (moves from {7,8} to {5,6}) \u2014 this is a cross-group change for object 11 and would require an operator that can move an object from {7,8} to {5,6}. No such operator exists for object 11 (it is not object_0 and not sneeze).\n  - next(12) = 8 (moves from {5,6} to {7,8}) \u2014 cross-group change for object 12; impossible for the same reason (12 is not object_0).\n  - next(9)  = 5 (moves from {7,8} to {5,6}) \u2014 cross-group change; impossible.\n\nBecause three of the four goal next-relations require crossing the {5,6} \u2194 {7,8} partition for objects that are not object_0, and no operator permits such cross-group moves for those objects, the overall goal state is unreachable.\n\nConclusion\n- No valid action sequence from the given operators and initial facts can achieve the requested goal. If you want a reachable goal, either:\n  - change the goal so each object's goal-next stays within its initial collect-group (or is the same object_0\u21947/5 move that memory can do for object_0), or\n  - add operators or initial facts (e.g. make some targeted object sneeze or cats, or add suitable spring/collect facts) that would allow the necessary cross-group transitions.\n\nIf you want, tell me which of the four goal next-relations are essential and I can try to produce a maximal achievable subset plan (or suggest the minimal change to initial facts/operators that would make the full goal reachable)."

    "response": "Thanks \u2014 I checked both problems.\n\n1) First statement + given plan\n- I verified each step against the action preconditions and effects, tracking the changing facts.\n- All 12 steps are applicable in order and their effects were applied consistently.\n- After the final step the four goal facts are present:\n  - next object_10 object_6 (created by step 10)\n  - next object_11 object_8 (created by step 3)\n  - next object_12 object_7 (created by step 12)\n  - next object_13 object_9 (was present in the initial state and never deleted)\n- Conclusion: the given plan is valid and achieves the stated goal.\n\n2) Second statement (initial facts given) \u2014 goal: next object_11 object_10\n- I examined what actions can create a next X Y fact: paltry, memory, wretched and tightfisted are the only actions that can add a next relation.\n- To obtain next object_11 object_10 one of those actions must be invoked with object_0 = object_11. I checked each possibility:\n\n  a) memory with object_0 = object_11\n     - memory requires cats object_11, but cats is true only for object_0 in the initial facts. So memory(11,\u00b7,\u00b7) is impossible.\n\n  b) wretched with object_0 = object_11\n     - wretched requires sneeze object_11, but sneeze holds only for object_3 and object_4 in the initial facts. So wretched(11,\u00b7,\u00b7,\u00b7) is impossible.\n\n  c) paltry with object_0 = object_11\n     - paltry requires vase(11,X), cats(X) and next(X,10). cats(X) is true only for X = object_0, so X must be object_0; that requires next(object_0,object_10). There is no way to produce next(object_0,object_10) given the available actions and the available spring/sneeze facts (memory could change next for object_0 because cats(object_0) is true, but memory would require spring(object_10) which is not present). So paltry(11,\u00b7,10) is not achievable.\n\n  d) tightfisted with object_0 = object_11\n     - tightfisted(11,X,10) requires:\n       * sneeze(X) \u2014 so X must be object_3 or object_4 (the only sneeze objects),\n       * next(X,10),\n       * vase(11,X).\n     - Consider X = object_3:\n       * next(object_3,object_7) is initial; wretched can only change next(object_3,\u00b7) among objects that share the same collect-target (collect facts are fixed). From the collects provided, object_7 belongs to the collect-group {5,6,7} while object_10 belongs to the collect-group {8,9,10}. No sequence of available wretched invocations can move next(object_3,object_7) into next(object_3,object_10). So next(object_3,object_10) is unreachable.\n     - Consider X = object_4:\n       * next(object_4,object_8) is initial, and using wretched we can get next(object_4,object_10) (because object_8 and object_10 share the same collect-target and stupendous object required is available). So next(object_4,object_10) is reachable.\n       * but tightfisted also requires vase(11,object_4). A vase is only produced by clip or sip. sip(11,4,\u00b7) would require cats(object_4) which is false. A clip that would produce vase(11,4) must be clip(11,4,Y) and needs next(4,Y) and next(11,Y). The only Y for which next(11,Y) is initially true is Y = object_6. That would require next(4,6). However next(4,\u00b7) can only take values in the collect-group {8,9,10} (because it starts at 8 and wretched only swaps among same collect-group), so next(4,6) cannot be produced. Therefore vase(11,4) cannot be produced.\n\n- Because none of paltry/memory/wretched/tightfisted can be made to produce next(object_11,object_10) under the given initial facts, the goal next object_11 object_10 is unreachable.\n\nFinal answer\n- First plan: valid and achieves its goal.\n- Second instance: the goal next object_11 object_10 is not achievable from the given initial state with the available actions (I gave the reasoning above)."

Reasoning:\n\n- Any operator that can add a next fact has an effect of the form \"next object_0 object_2\" \u2014 so to get next object_11 object_9 we must execute an operator whose first argument is object_11.\n- For each operator with first argument object_11, its preconditions (specialized below) are not achievable from the initial facts unless next object_11 object_9 already holds (circular) or unless we add a missing initial fact:\n\n  1. paltry(11, X, 9) requires hand 11 (present), cats X (the only cats fact is cats object_0 so X must be object_0), texture 9 (present), vase 11 object_0 (not present), and next object_0 object_9 (not present). So paltry needs next object_0 object_9 (or vase 11 object_0) first \u2014 cannot be made without an operator that itself needs next object_11 object_9 or some unavailable fact.\n\n  2. sip(11, X, 9) requires next 11 9 as a precondition (so circular).\n\n  3. clip(11, X, 9) requires next 11 9 as a precondition (circular).\n\n  4. wretched(11, A, 9, B) requires sneeze 11 (absent). We cannot create sneeze 11 with any operator (no operator adds sneeze facts), so this path is blocked.\n\n  5. memory(11, A, 9) requires cats 11 (absent) and springs matching the other arguments; cats 11 cannot be created by any operator.\n\n  6. tightfisted(11, A, 9) needs vase 11 A (which can only be added by sip/clip, both of which require next 11 9) \u2014 again circular.\n\nBecause none of the operators that could produce next object_11 object_9 can be initiated from the available facts (they either require next object_11 object_9 itself, require sneeze object_11 or cats object_11 which are not and cannot be made true), the goal is unreachable under the current initial conditions.\n\nIf you are willing to change the initial facts slightly, here is a minimal fix and a one-step plan:\n\n- Add sneeze object_11 to the initial facts. Then wretched 11 8 9 2 is applicable:\n  - Preconditions: sneeze 11 (now true), texture 8 (true), texture 9 (true), stupendous 2 (true), next 11 8 (true in your initial state), collect 8 2 (true), collect 9 2 (true).\n  - Effect: adds next 11 9 (and deletes next 11 8).\nSo with sneeze object_11 added, the single action\n  wretched object_11 object_8 object_9 object_2\nachieves the goal.\n\nIf you prefer a different allowed modification (e.g. adding cats object_11 or spring object_9), tell me which kinds of initial facts you can change and I will produce a feasible plan under that modification."

    "response": "Short answer: with the operators you gave and the second initial state, the goals (next object_11 object_7 and next object_12 object_5) are not achievable. The required preconditions to produce those two next(...) facts cannot be satisfied from the given facts \u2014 the plan space contains unavoidable dead-ends. Below I show why (concise invariant reasoning), point out where any attempted plan gets stuck, and give a few minimal changes you could make to the initial facts so a plan would exist.\n\nWhy it is impossible (key invariants and bottlenecks)\n\n1) Which actions can create next for a hand (object_11 or object_12)?\n- Only paltry(...) and tightfisted(...) produce a next fact whose first argument is a hand (they both have an effect next object_0 object_2 where the first arg is the hand).\n- paltry(h,c,t) requires vase(h,c) and cats(c) and next(c,t).\n- tightfisted(h,s,t) requires vase(h,s) (s is a sneeze) and next(s,t).\n\nSo to get next object_12 object_5 we must either\n  A) have vase(object_12, object_0) and next(object_0, object_5) and then run paltry(12,0,5), or\n  B) have some sneeze s with next(s,object_5) and a vase(object_12, s) and then run tightfisted(12,s,5).\n\n2) paltry route (A) is blocked by a circularity:\n- The only operator that can create vase(h,c) with c being a cat is sip(h,c,t). But sip(h,c,t) requires next(h,t) as a precondition. For h = object_12 and t = object_5 that would require next(object_12,object_5) to already hold \u2014 that is circular. There is no other way to make vase(object_12,object_0) without already having next(object_12,object_5). So paltry cannot give next(object_12,object_5) starting from the given facts.\n\n3) tightfisted route (B) requires:\n- A vase(object_12, s) where s is a sneeze, and\n- next(s,object_5).\n\nA vase(object_12,s) can only be created by clip(12,s,t) (clip creates vase(h,s)) and clip requires next(s,t) and next(12,t) for the same t. In the initial state the only next with first arg 12 is next(object_12,object_10) (t = object_10). So t must be object_10. Thus you need some sneeze s for which next(s,object_10) can be made. That is possible for sneeze object_4 (you can use wretched(4,8,10,2) because collect(8,2) and collect(10,2) hold) \u2014 that yields next(4,10), then clip(12,4,10) makes vase(12,4). But now tightfisted(12,4,5) needs next(4,5). Can next(4,5) be produced? Starting state has next(4,8). wretched can change next(4,8) -> next(4,X) only when you have collect(8,stup) and collect(X,stup) for the same stup. The collects that go with the same stup in your initial facts are pairs with stup = object_2 (10,8,9) and with stup = object_1 (5,6,7). For object_4's current next (8), the only t2 you can get from wretched(4,8,t2,2) are textures t2 that have collect(t2,object_2) \u2014 those are 10 and 9 (not 5). So you cannot get next(4,5). That blocks tightfisted(12,4,5). The other sneeze (object_3) can reach 5 (wretched(3,6,5,1) works) but you cannot make vase(12,3) because clip(12,3,t) would require next(3,t) and next(12,t) for the same t; the only next(12,t) initially is t=10, and next(3,10) is not achievable given the collect facts (3's starting next is 6; 6 and 10 do not share a collect target). So there is no way to produce vase(12,3) while also meeting clip preconditions. In sum: every path that could produce vase(object_12, sneeze) ends up requiring making some sneeze point to object_5 that is impossible given the collect mapping.\n\nConclusion for object_12: next(object_12,object_5) cannot be produced from the given initial facts and operators.\n\n4) Similar blocking exists for next(object_11,object_7)\n- To produce next for hand object_11 we again need paltry(11,0,7) or tightfisted(11,s,7). paltry requires vase(11,0) which has the same circularity as above. For tightfisted we would need a sneeze s with next(s,7) and vase(11,s).\n- To create vase(11,s) we need clip(11,s,t) with next(s,t) and next(11,t). Initially next(11,t) = next(11,object_9). So t must be object_9. We can make next(4,9) via wretched(4,8,9,2) (since collect(8,2) and collect(9,2) hold), then clip(11,4,9) would create vase(11,4). But tightfisted(11,4,7) then requires next(4,7). However, as above, 4 can be moved only among textures that share the same collect(stup) group (object_2 group: {8,9,10}). 7 is in the other collect group (object_1), so next(4,7) is not achievable. Sneeze 3 could be made to 7 (wretched(3,6,7,1) works) but you cannot create vase(11,3) because clip(11,3,t) would require next(3,t) and next(11,t) for same t; t would have to be 9 (since next(11,9) initially), but next(3,9) is not achievable because 3's collect group is different. Therefore next(object_11,object_7) is likewise unreachable.\n\nSo both goal facts are blocked; any plan attempting to produce them will get stuck for the reasons above.\n\nWhat to change so the goals become achievable\nIf you want a concrete plan, you will need to change some initial facts so a non-circular precondition can be satisfied. Minimal helpful changes (examples):\n\n- To get next(object_12,object_5):\n  - Add collect(object_5, object_2). With that extra collect, sneeze object_4 can be made to point to object_5 (via wretched) and the sequence below becomes possible:\n    1) wretched object_4 object_8 object_10 object_2  (makes next(4,10))\n    2) clip    object_12 object_4 object_10            (creates vase(12,4), deletes next(12,10))\n    3) wretched object_4 object_10 object_5 object_2  (makes next(4,5))\n    4) tightfisted object_12 object_4 object_5        (uses vase(12,4) and next(4,5) to make next(12,5))\n- To get next(object_11,object_7):\n  - Add collect(object_7, object_2) (or alternatively change the collect grouping to allow a sneeze that can both reach the t used by clip and reach 7). With that, a similar 4\u219210\u21927 sequence becomes possible and then clip/tightfisted can create next(11,7).\n\nIf you prefer, I can:\n- (A) Search for and output a concrete valid action sequence after you accept one or more of the minimal fact changes above, or\n- (B) Try to synthesize any other possible fact adjustments (or operator relaxations) that would make both goals achievable, or\n- (C) Re-run a planner to try different assignment choices if you think I've overlooked a route (tell me if any operator pre/effects differ from what you posted).\n\nWhich would you like me to do next?"

However, next object_13 object_9 is not achievable from the given initial facts and the available actions \u2014 there is no valid sequence that produces next object_13 object_9. Reason:\n\n- The only actions that can add a next fact with first argument 13 are:\n  - paltry (requires cats object_13 \u2014 cats object_13 is not in the initial state and no action can add cats),\n  - wretched (requires sneeze object_13 \u2014 sneeze object_13 is not in the initial state and no action can add sneeze),\n  - memory (requires cats object_13 \u2014 again not possible),\n  - tightfisted (requires a vase fact vase object_13 X and other preconditions).\n- So the only viable route would be to create a vase fact vase object_13 X and then use tightfisted to add next object_13 Y. A vase with first arg 13 can only be created by:\n  - clip object_13 S T (requires S to be a sneeze object, so S \u2208 {object_4, object_5}), and requires both next S T and next 13 T already hold; or\n  - sip object_13 C T (requires C to be a cats object \u2014 there is no cats object_13 and no action can create cats 13).\n- clip to create vase(13,S) therefore requires some next(13,T) to already exist (it is circular), except in the special bootstrap case where next(13,T) already exists initially. Initially we have next object_13 object_7. That lets us create vase object_13 object_4 by first making next object_4 object_7 (which is possible via wretched because 4 \u2192 8 can change to 4 \u2192 7). That path yields vase(13,4) and then tightfisted can produce next(13,Z) only for Z values reachable from next(4,\u00b7) (i.e. within the collect-group of 4\u2019s targets: {6,7,8}). In short, using the available bootstrap, next(13,\u00b7) values you can obtain lie in {6,7,8}.\n- To get next(13,9) you would need to produce a vase(13,5) (so tightfisted with sneeze=5 could yield next(13,9)), but vase(13,5) would require a next(13,T) already present for some T that matches next(5,T) (circular), and there is no non-circular way to bootstrap vase(13,5) given the initial facts. There is no action that can create cats(13) or sneeze(13), so paltry/memory/wretched for o0=13 are impossible.\n- Therefore next object_13 object_9 is unreachable under the given initial state and actions.\n\nIf you want I can:\n- produce a full reachable-set analysis for next(13,\u00b7) showing which targets are reachable (e.g. {6,7,8}), or\n- suggest minimal changes to the initial facts (e.g. add sneeze object_13 or cats object_13, or add a collect that links groups) that would make next object_13 object_9 reachable and then produce a plan."

    "response": "Short answer: there is no valid plan \u2014 the subgoal next object_12 object_8 is unreachable from the given initial facts and actions. Therefore the overall goal (next 11 8, next 12 8, next 13 10) cannot be achieved.\n\nReason (concise, focusing on object_12):\n\n1. Which actions can produce a next fact next(X,Y)?\n   - paltry(h,a,b) produces next(h,b).\n   - memory(a,s,t) produces next(a,t).\n   - wretched(s,t,b,stup) produces next(s,b) (s must be a sneeze object).\n   - tightfisted(h,s,b) produces next(h,b).\n\n   So to obtain next object_12 object_8 we must use one of those four actions with h or a or s = object_12.\n\n2. Why memory and wretched are impossible for object_12:\n   - memory requires cats(object_12). cats is only given for object_0 in the initial state, hence memory cannot produce next for object_12.\n   - wretched can produce next(s,...) only for s that is a sneeze object. object_12 is not a sneeze in the initial state, and no action can add a sneeze fact. So wretched cannot produce next for object_12.\n\n3. Remaining possibilities: paltry or tightfisted for object_12\n   - paltry(12,a,b) requires a vase fact vase(12,a) and cats(a). The only cats fact is cats(object_0), so paltry would require vase(12,object_0). How can vase(12,object_0) be created?\n     - sip can create vase(h,a) but sip(12,0,b) would require next(12,b) and next(0,b) to already exist (and next(12,b) is the thing we want to create), so that is circular.\n     - clip creates vase(h,s) only for s that is a sneeze object. object_0 is not a sneeze, so clip cannot create vase(12,object_0).\n     => therefore vase(12,object_0) cannot be produced, so paltry cannot yield next(12,8).\n   - tightfisted(12,s,8) requires vase(12,s) for some sneeze s (s must be 3 or 4 here), and next(s,8).\n     - For s = object_3: to get next(3,8) is impossible under the collect facts given. Starting from next(3,7), wretched can change next(3,7) only to objects whose collect value shares the same stupendous index; from 7 the reachable targets are limited to those with the same collect stupendous as 7, and none allow reaching 8. A short reachable-set analysis shows next(3,8) cannot be reached.\n     - For s = object_4: next(4,8) is reachable (via wretched 4 10 8 2), but vase(12,4) is required. vase(12,4) could only be produced by clip(12,4,b) or sip(12,4,b). clip(12,4,b) requires next(12,b) and next(4,b) already true. The only next(12,?) present initially is next(12,6); that would force b=6, but next(4,6) cannot be made (collect/stupendous constraints prevent making next(4,6)). sip needs cats(4) which is false. Thus vase(12,4) cannot be produced.\n     => tightfisted cannot be executed for object_12 with any sneeze s.\n\n4. Conclusion for object_12:\n   - None of paltry, memory, wretched, tightfisted can produce next object_12 object_8 from the given initial facts and action definitions. So next object_12 object_8 is unreachable.\n\nSince one required goal atom (next object_12 object_8) is unreachable, the overall goal set {next object_11 object_8, next object_12 object_8, next object_13 object_10} is unreachable; no valid plan exists.\n\nIf you like, I can:\n- produce a proof trace / detailed reachable-set argument for object_12 (step-by-step reasoning about which next-values for object_12 and for the relevant sleepers/sneeze nodes are possible),\n- or produce a maximal partial plan that achieves the two reachable goal atoms (next 11 8 and next 13 10), and then show where it gets stuck on next 12 8. Which would you prefer?"

Conclusion: the goal (next object_12 object_10, next object_13 object_10, next object_14 object_9) is not reachable from the given initial state \u2014 there is no valid sequence of the available actions that can achieve all three goal facts.  \n\nReason (summary of the blocking cycles):\n- Which actions can add next(X,Y)?\n  - paltry(X,.,Y), wretched(X,.,Y,.), memory(X,.,Y), tightfisted(X,.,Y).\n- For X = object_12 and object_13:\n  - memory requires cats(X) \u2014 cats only holds for object_0 and object_1, so memory cannot change next for 12 or 13.\n  - wretched requires sneeze(X) \u2014 sneeze holds only for object_4 and object_5, so wretched cannot change next for 12 or 13.\n  - That leaves paltry and tightfisted. Both paltry and tightfisted require a vase fact vase(X,...) as a precondition (paltry needs vase X o1; tightfisted needs vase X o1). But vase facts can only be produced by sip or clip.\n  - sip and clip both require next(X, some_o2) in their preconditions (they require next o0 o2). So to create vase(X,...) you already need a next(X,...) fact. Thus getting a vase for X is circular \u2014 you cannot create the required vase for object_12 or object_13 without already having the target next for that same object. Therefore next object_12 object_10 and next object_13 object_10 are impossible to create.\n\n- For X = object_14 and target 9:\n  - paltry(14,1,9) would be a straightforward way (hand14 and cats1 and texture9 and next1 9 are present) but it requires vase(14,1).\n  - As for object_12/13, vase(14,1) can only be made by sip or clip, and each of those requires next(14, ...) to already hold. So again creation of the necessary vase for object_14 is circular and impossible under the initial facts.\n  - Other alternatives (wretched on 14, memory on 14, or tightfisted on 14 with some other sneeze object) are blocked by missing sneeze/cats/spring facts or by the same vase/next circularity.\n\nBecause each goal next(...) for 12,13,14 would require a vase that can only be made if the very next(...) we want (or some other next for the same hand-object) already exists, there is no non\u2011circular way to establish those next facts from the given initial state.\n\nIf you want a viable plan, you must relax/change the initial state (examples):\n- give object_12 or object_13 the sneeze property (so wretched can be used), or\n- give object_12 or object_13 the cats property (so memory can be used), or\n- add spring object_10 (so memory(1,9,10) could create next1 10 and then paltry/tightfisted approaches become possible), or\n- add an initial vase fact like vase object_12 object_1 (this breaks the cycle and allows paltry/tightfisted to add the desired next), or\n- add next object_12 object_10 (trivial).\n\nTell me which initial fact(s) you can change/allow and I will produce a concrete action sequence to reach the goal."

    "response": "I examined the domain, initial facts and the available actions. I could not find any valid action sequence that achieves all of your goals (next object_11 object_9, next object_12 object_8, next object_13 object_5, next object_14 object_7) from the given initial state. Key reasons (by goal) follow.\n\nHigh-level observation\n- The only actions that can add a next X Y are: wretched (adds next a c), memory (adds next a c), paltry (adds next a c), and tightfisted (adds next a c).\n- Each of those has prerequisites that must already hold for the particular object a (or require creating a vase fact first). Many of those prerequisites are absent in the initial state and cannot be generated by any other action (so they are unreachable).\n\nWhy next object_12 object_8 is unreachable\n- To change next(12,5) \u2192 next(12,8) we need an action that produces next(12,8).\n- memory(12,5,8) would be the simplest (it requires cats object_12, spring object_5, spring object_8 and next(12,5)). spring(5) and spring(8) and next(12,5) exist, but cats object_12 does not \u2014 and there is no action that produces cats facts, so cats object_12 is permanently unreachable.\n- wretched(12, \u2026) would require sneeze object_12 (not present) and there is no action that can create sneeze facts.\n- paltry/tightfisted require a vase(12, b) plus other preconditions; vase(12,b) can only be created by clip or sip, but clip(a,b,c) requires next(12,c) to already hold (c would need to be 5 to use the existing next(12,5)), and clip also requires next(b,c) for the same c. No object b in the initial state has next(b,5), so clip cannot produce a vase for object_12. sip requires cats b (only object_0 is cats) and also requires next(12,c) to already hold for that c \u2014 so sip is circular or unusable.\n- Conclusion: none of the actions can produce next(12,8) given the missing cats(12) or sneeze(12) or a suitable b with next(b,8). So next(12,8) is unreachable.\n\nWhy next object_13 object_5 is unreachable\n- We currently have next(13,7). To get next(13,5), memory(13,7,5) would work if cats(13) existed \u2014 it does not, and cats facts cannot be created by any action.\n- wretched requires sneeze(13) (not present and cannot be created).\n- paltry/tightfisted would require a vase(13,b) and other preconditions (cats b or sneeze b etc). There is no way to create such a vase without already having appropriate next links or cats on 13. So unreachable.\n\nWhy next object_11 object_9 and next object_14 object_7 are blocked\n- next(14,7): initially next(14,9). To change 14\u21927 we need one of the actions that adds next(14,7). memory(14,9,7) would require cats(14) (absent), wretched requires sneeze(14) (absent), paltry/tightfisted require vase(14,b) and next(b,7). There is no b with sneeze and next(b,7) combination available to create the needed vase. Thus unreachable under current facts.\n- next(11,9): similar reasoning \u2014 to produce next(11,9) we need memory(11,10,9) (requires cats(11)), or wretched(11, \u2026) (requires sneeze(11)), or paltry/tightfisted which require creating vase(11,b) and suitable next(b,9) \u2014 the only b with next(b,9) initially is b=4, but making the vase(11,4) requires a clip that itself needs next(4,10) (which can be created only by wretched(4,9,10,2) but that deletes next(4,9) so it undermines the later use of 4\u21929). I checked the possible sequences and they are circular or destructive; no sequence yields next(11,9) while keeping the needed prerequisites in place.\n\nSummary\n- At least the three critical missing prerequisites (cats on the source object, or sneeze on the source object, or an available b with suitable next(b,target) and sneeze(b), etc.) cannot be produced by any action in the model.\n- Therefore, with the provided initial facts and actions, there is no valid plan that achieves the goal set.\n\nIf you want a plan, you can either:\n- Relax/modify the goals (for example keep some existing next links), or\n- Add one of the missing prerequisite facts to the initial state so the relevant action becomes applicable. Minimal helpful additions would be, for example:\n  - Add cats object_12 (then memory(12,5,8) would give next(12,8)), and/or\n  - Add cats object_13 (memory(13,7,5) to get next(13,5)), and/or\n  - Add cats object_11 (memory(11,10,9) to get next(11,9)), and/or\n  - Add cats object_14 (memory(14,9,7) to get next(14,7)).\n- Alternatively, add sneeze for the relevant source objects (sneeze object_11, object_12, object_13, object_14) if you prefer wretched/tightfisted-based sequences \u2014 but note wretched also needs appropriate collect and stupendous facts.\n\nIf you want, tell me which minimal initial-fact additions you are willing to allow (e.g., add cats object_12 and cats object_13), and I will produce a concrete action sequence (plan) that attains the goals under those modified initials."

Those two require either sneeze A or cats A.\n\nExamine the goal subjects A = object_11, object_12, object_13, object_14 in the initial state:\n- None of these have sneeze (sneeze objects are only object_3 and object_4).\n- None of these have cats (cats is only object_0).\n- They do have hand, but that does not allow wretched or memory.\n\nBecause none of object_11,12,13,14 satisfy sneeze or cats, there is no way to introduce new next facts for them except by actions (sip/clip/paltry/tightfisted) that themselves require a next for the same object already (circular). That makes it impossible to derive the required next facts next(11,10), next(12,6), next(13,10), next(14,7).\n\nIf you want a constructive plan, you must change the problem input. Options:\n- Give cats to the objects you want memory to act on (e.g., cats object_11) so memory can set their next.\n- Give sneeze to those objects so wretched can change their next.\n- Or allow an initial next for each subject that can be used by clip/sip to bootstrap a vase and then use paltry/tightfisted to change it.\n\nTell me which of those changes you'd like (or permit adding a small helper action that grants sneeze/cats), and I will produce a valid plan."

The only actions that can add next for a hand node are paltry or tightfisted.\n  - Both paltry and tightfisted require a vase object_15 B to exist. The only action that creates a vase is clip, which requires a sneeze B with next B C equal to the current next of object_15.\n  - object_15's current next is object_6. There is no sneeze node that has next to object_6 in the initial state (sneeze nodes are object_4 and object_5; their nexts are not object_6). Because no clip can be formed to create a vase for object_15, no paltry/tightfisted can change object_15's next. So next object_15 object_9 cannot be achieved.\n\n- next object_14 object_10 (desired) is unreachable:\n  - As above, to set next for hand object_14 we need paltry or tightfisted and thus a vase object_14 B created by clip.\n  - A clip to create vase object_14 B needs a sneeze B whose next equals the current next of object_14 (current next object_14 object_7). There is a sneeze node (object_4) with next object_7, so clip object_14 object_4 object_7 would produce vase object_14 object_4 \u2014 that part is possible.\n  - To then do tightfisted object_14 object_4 object_10 (to get next object_14 object_10) we would need next object_4 object_10. But object_4 is a sneeze node whose next can only be changed by wretched. Every wretched that moves a sneeze node's next moves it among objects that share the same collect target D. object_4's initial next is object_7, and object_7 belongs to the collect-group whose D = object_2 (objects {object_6, object_7, object_8}). Thus object_4's next can only move among {object_6, object_7, object_8} \u2014 it can never reach object_10, which belongs to the different collect-group (D = object_3, members {object_9, object_10, object_11}). The other sneeze (object_5) can reach object_10, but clip to create vase object_14 object_5 would require next object_5 to equal object_14's current next (object_7), which object_5 cannot become (object_5 is in the other collect-group). So there is no way to produce the required next object_4 object_10 (or to get a vase with a sneeze that does have next to object_10 while matching object_14's next), so next object_14 object_10 cannot be achieved.\n\nSummary\n- Achievable (with the 7-step plan above): next object_12 object_11 and next object_13 object_8.\n- Unachievable from the given initial state: next object_14 object_10 and next object_15 object_9 (reasons given).\n\nIf you want, I can:\n- produce the plan in another format, or\n- try alternative rearrangements (but the two impossible goals will remain unreachable under the given constraints), or\n- search for any alternative combination that achieves additional goals (it looks impossible for those two)."

    "response": "Short answer: the second goal state is unreachable from the given initial state. No valid sequence of the available actions can produce next object_11 object_7, next object_12 object_9, next object_13 object_8, next object_14 object_9 and next object_15 object_6 all at once.  \n\nReasoning (key invariants and impossibility arguments):\n\n1) Collect-group partition of textures\n- From the collect facts we can partition textures into two collect-groups:\n  - G1 = {object_5, object_6, object_7} (they collect -> object_1)\n  - G2 = {object_8, object_9, object_10} (they collect -> object_2)\n\n2) Which entities can ever hold textures from which group\n- Sneeze object_3 initially has next object_3 object_6 (object_6 \u2208 G1). The only action that changes a sneeze's next is wretched, and wretched requires collect facts that force both old and new textures to share the same collect-parent (same o3). Thus sneeze object_3 can only ever take textures from G1.\n- Sneeze object_4 initially has next object_4 object_8 (object_8 \u2208 G2). By the same wretched constraint, sneeze object_4 can only ever take textures from G2.\n- Cats object_0 initially has next object_0 object_5 (object_5 \u2208 G1). The only action that can change cats' next is memory, and memory here can only toggle object_0 between the two springs present (object_5 and object_8), because the springs available are object_5 and object_8. So cats object_0 can only ever be object_5 or object_8 (i.e., either object_5 \u2208 G1 or object_8 \u2208 G2), never object_9.\n\n3) How hands acquire textures\n- The only actions that create a next fact for a hand are:\n  - paltry: creates next hand texture using the cats' texture (requires a vase between hand and cats and next cats texture).\n  - tightfisted: creates next hand texture using a sneeze's texture (requires a vase between hand and sneeze and next sneeze texture).\n- A vase between a hand and a sneeze is produced by clip; clip requires the hand already to have next to the same texture as the sneeze (i.e., clip needs next hand T and next sneeze T). Hence to use tightfisted to put a new texture T' onto a hand, you must first have had the hand mapped to some texture T such that the corresponding sneeze also had T. Because sneeze3 is stuck in G1 and sneeze4 is stuck in G2, you cannot use them to move a hand from a texture in one collect-group to a texture in the other collect-group in general (you would need a sneeze that can simultaneously hold textures from both groups, which does not exist).\n- Similarly paltry uses cats' texture; but cats object_0 can only be object_5 or object_8 (never object_9), so paltry cannot set a hand to object_9.\n\n4) Applying the above to the requested goals\n- The goal requires hand object_12 \u2192 object_9 and hand object_14 \u2192 object_9 (object_9 \u2208 G2), but hands object_12 and object_14 initially have next to object_5 (object_5 \u2208 G1).\n- To move a hand from a G1 texture to a G2 texture we would need either:\n  - a sneeze that can hold a G1 texture (to satisfy clip precondition) and also a G2 texture (to be used by tightfisted) \u2014 impossible because sneeze{3,4} are each confined to one collect-group; or\n  - cats to provide object_9 via paltry \u2014 impossible because cats object_0 can only be object_5 or object_8, never object_9.\n- Therefore object_12 and object_14 cannot be moved from object_5 to object_9 under these rules. Because fulfilling those two hand mappings is required by the goal, the whole goal state is unreachable.\n\nConclusion and offer\n- There is no valid plan that achieves the requested goal from the given initial state.\n- If you want I can:\n  - produce a proof trace that demonstrates one of the required hand mappings is impossible (step-by-step invariant reasoning), or\n  - search for a reachable goal that is as close as possible (e.g., map object_12 and object_14 to object_8 instead of object_9), or\n  - attempt to produce a plan for a relaxed / modified goal (for example, if you allow cats to get object_9 as a spring or add collect/collectable facts).

    "response": "Short answer: There is no valid plan that achieves the second goal set. In particular, next object_12 object_6 is unreachable from the given initial facts and action schemas, so the overall goal (which requires next object_12 object_6) cannot be achieved.\n\nReasoning (compact, stepwise):\n\n1) Which actions can create a next(X,Y) fact?\n   - paltry(X,_,Y)\n   - wretched(X,_,Y,_)\n   - memory(X,_,Y)\n   - tightfisted(X,_,Y)\n\n   So to get next(12,6) some action of one of those four families must be applied with X = 12 and Y = 6.\n\n2) Check each option for X=12:\n   - memory(12, ..., 6) requires cats(12). The only cats fact in the initial state is cats object_0 (i.e. cats 0). So cats(12) is false \u2192 memory cannot add next(12,6).\n   - wretched(12, ..., 6, ...) requires sneeze(12). The only sneeze facts are sneeze 3 and sneeze 4; sneeze(12) is false \u2192 wretched cannot add next(12,6).\n   - paltry(12, A, 6) requires vase(12,A) and next(A,6) (and hand(12), cats(A), texture(6)). We do have hand(12) and texture(6); cats(A) forces A = 0 (since only cats 0 is true). So paltry(12,0,6) would need vase(12,0) and next(0,6). There is no way to obtain next(0,6) (see point 3), and vase(12,0) can only be created by clip/sip, which themselves require next(12,\u00b7) preconditions (circular). So paltry cannot produce next(12,6).\n   - tightfisted(12, A, 6) requires vase(12,A), sneeze(A), texture(6), and next(A,6). The only sneeze A values are 3 or 4, so we would need some A in {3,4} with next(A,6) and vase(12,A). So the problem reduces to creating both (a) next(3,6) or next(4,6) and (b) vase(12,3) or vase(12,4). We can examine these subgoals:\n\n3) Can we get next(3,6) or next(4,6)?\n   - next(3,6) can be produced by wretched(3,7,6,1) because sneeze(3), texture(7), texture(6), stupendous(1) are true, next(3,7) is true initially, and collect(7,1) and collect(6,1) are both true. So next(3,6) is achievable.\n   - next(4,6) would require wretched(4,*,6,*). Any candidate wretched(4,x,6,o3) needs collect(x,o3) and collect(6,o3) with the same o3. The collect facts are collect(6,1) and collect(9,2), collect(10,2), collect(8,2), etc. There is no object o3 that is collected by both 6 and some x that gives a usable precondition to reach 6 for source 4. In short, next(4,6) is not achievable with the available collect facts (no matching collect pair to satisfy wretched preconditions). So only next(3,6) is achievable among sneeze sources.\n\n4) Can we create vase(12,3) so we can use tightfisted(12,3,6)?\n   - vases are created only by clip(...) or sip(...). Both clip(12,3,\u00b7) and sip(12,3,\u00b7) require next(12,\u00b7) as a precondition (they require next object_0 object_2 where object_0 is 12). Initially next(12,8) is true, so only clip(12,3,8) or sip(12,3,8) are immediately feasible in that respect, but both also require next(3,8).\n   - next(3,8) cannot be created: wretched(3,7,8,...) would require collect(7,o3) and collect(8,o3) for the same o3; collect(7,1) and collect(8,2) do not share an o3, so that wretched precondition cannot be satisfied. memory(3,...) cannot be used because cats(3) is false. So next(3,8) is not achievable, hence clip(12,3,8)/sip(12,3,8) cannot produce vase(12,3).\n   - More generally, any clip/sip that would make vase(12,A) requires some next(A,t) that we either cannot build or that forces circular dependence on next(12,6) itself. There is no noncircular way to get vase(12,3) (or vase(12,4) that pairs with next(4,6), because next(4,6) is itself unachievable as explained).\n\n5) Therefore there is no way to produce both a vase(12,A) and next(A,6) with A sneeze(=3 or 4). The two required pieces for tightfisted(12,A,6) cannot be simultaneously obtained from the initial state and the rules.\n\n6) Since none of paltry/wretched/memory/tightfisted can produce next(12,6) (either directly or indirectly), next(12,6) is unreachable. Because the goal includes next(12,6), the full goal is unreachable.\n\nExtra note: some parts of the goal are reachable (for example the sequence sketched in my head for making next(15,8) is feasible), but that does not salvage the overall goal because next(12,6) is a hard blocker.\n\nIf you want, I can:\n- produce a maximal partial plan that achieves as many of the goal atoms as possible (e.g. show how to reach next(15,8) and next(13,5) if they are reachable), or\n- try a small search to double-check the impossibility exhaustively (I reasoned symbolically above), or\n- suggest minimal changes to the problem (add cats(12) or sneeze(12) or a collect linking 3 and 8) that would make the goal achievable. Which would you prefer?"

But neither next object_0 object_7 nor next object_1 object_7 can be created with the available operators and static facts:\n      - memory to move next object_0/1 to 7 would require spring object_7 \u2014 not present.\n      - wretched to move next object_1 to 7 would require sneeze object_1 \u2014 not present.\n    - If Y = object_4 or object_5 (sneeze-holding Ys), then tightfisted would need next Y object_7. Although we can create next object_4 object_7 using wretched (4 8 7 2 is possible), we cannot create vase object_13 object_4: clip requires a common z such that next object_4 z and next object_13 z simultaneously hold; there is no way to make such a z for object_13 and object_4 together given the collect/next constraints in the instance (attempts to create next object_13 8 or next object_4 9 etc. fail because the required collect facts are not compatible). And sip cannot create vase object_13 object_4 because sip requires cats object_4 (false).\n- Because neither memory nor wretched apply to object_13 and because all ways to obtain the necessary vase + partner next facts for paltry/tightfisted are blocked by missing static facts (cats, sneeze, springs, collects), there is no sequence of the available operators that can produce next object_13 object_7 from the given initial state.\n\nIf you want I can:\n- produce a compact plan in the exact formal action syntax only (the 7-step plan above), or\n- try alternative search orders to double-check there is absolutely no longer sequence that could produce next object_13 object_7 (I already traced the operator requirements and the static predicates preventing the necessary preconditions), or\n- modify the problem instance (e.g., add spring object_7 or cats object_13 or a collect that enables the necessary wretched) so next object_13 object_7 becomes achievable and then produce a full plan. Which would you prefer?"

Neither cat (object_0 or object_1) has next = object_8 initially, and the only operator that changes cat next (memory) can only swap between the two spring values present (object_6 and object_9), so you cannot make a cat have next = object_8.\n- tightfisted would require vase(object_16, s) for some sneeze s and next(s, object_8). The only sneeze that can have next = object_8 is object_4 (it initially has next 4 8 and can move among {6,7,8} because collect entries with stup object_2 cover {6,7,8}). But to get vase(object_16, object_4) via clip you need next(object_16, t) and next(object_4, t) for the same t \u2014 that requires next(object_16, 8) to already be true (because next(object_4,8) is the available match), which is circular. Other sneeze objects (e.g. object_5) that you can align with object_16 by using clip cannot be moved to give next = object_8 because their collect group (stup object_3) does not include object_8.\n- So there is no sequence of allowed actions that produces next object_16 object_8 from the given initial facts.\n\nIf you want, I can:\n- produce a variant plan that also sets next object_16 to some reachable value (e.g. 9) instead, or\n- show a step-by-step simulation of the state changes for the plan above, or\n- try again if you change the initial collects/springs/stupendous facts so that object_16\u21928 becomes achievable."

    "response": "I checked the domain and the second problem instance. Short answer: no valid plan can achieve all the requested goal facts from the given initial facts. Two of the goal facts are already true, but the other four cannot be produced because their prerequisites are unreachable given the initial facts.\n\nWhat is already satisfied\n- next object_14 object_7 (present initially)\n- next object_15 object_10 (present initially)\n\nWhat must be produced but cannot be reached\n- next object_11 object_5\n- next object_12 object_8\n- next object_13 object_8\n- next object_16 object_8\n\nWhy these are unreachable (concise reasoning)\n- Every action that can add a next X Y for a particular X is one of: memory, wretched, paltry, tightfisted (these are the only operators that add next for a specific first argument).\n  - memory requires cats(X) (a cat fact about the same X).\n  - wretched requires sneeze(X).\n  - paltry / tightfisted require a vase(X, Z) fact (vase with X as the first argument).\n- For the four failing X (11, 12, 13, 16) the initial state has none of:\n  - cats(X) (only cats object_0 is present)\n  - sneeze(X) (only sneeze objects 3 and 4)\n  - any vase(X, \u00b7) fact\n  So memory and wretched are impossible for these X, and paltry/tightfisted require a vase(X, \u00b7) first.\n- A vase(X, \u00b7) can only be produced by clip or sip. Both clip and sip require next facts of the form next(X, someY) (i.e. they require an existing next for the same X) as preconditions (clip/sip need next X Z and next something Z). That makes creation of any vase with X as subject circular unless next(X,\u00b7) already exists.\n- Therefore there is no way to bootstrap any new next(X,\u00b7) for X in {11,12,13,16} from the given initial facts; you cannot create the needed vase facts nor satisfy memory/wretched preconditions. Consequently next 11->5, 12->8, 13->8, 16->8 are all unreachable.\n\nPossible fixes / suggestions\n- Modify the initial facts so that at least one of the enabling preconditions for each target X holds. For example, for each X \u2208 {11,12,13,16} add at least one of:\n  - cats(X) (so memory would become available), or\n  - sneeze(X) (so wretched would become available), or\n  - an initial vase(X, Y) for some Y (so paltry/tightfisted could add a next).\n  Any one of these avoids the circularity for that X.\n- For next object_11 object_5 specifically, paltry would also require a next(object_1,5) with object_1 having cats. Currently only object_0 has cats and next object_0 object_8 is present, not next object_0 object_5; so you would need to add a suitable next or adjust cats facts accordingly (for example, add next object_0 object_5 initially, or give cats to a different object that already has next(...,5)).\n- If you want me to, I can:\n  - propose minimal concrete initial-fact changes that make the goal achievable, or\n  - produce a concrete plan for a modified initial state (tell me which added fact(s) you prefer), or\n  - attempt to produce a plan if you allow insertion of specific vase/next/cats/sneeze facts into the initial state.\n\nIf you want, tell me which small initial changes you are willing to allow (e.g., add cats to which objects; add vase facts; add a few next facts), and I will produce a valid plan for that modified instance."

    "response": "Short answer: there is no valid plan that achieves all six goals from the given initial state. In particular next object_13 object_7 and next object_15 object_8 cannot be reached under the action schemata and the given initial facts. I can, however, show a correct plan that achieves the reachable goals (next object_11 object_5 and next object_14 object_5) while preserving next object_12 object_9 and next object_16 object_6, and I will explain why the other two goals are unreachable.\n\nWhy next object_13 object_7 is unreachable (sketch)\n- The only action that can produce next(h,7) for a hand h is tightfisted(h, s, 7) (it copies a sneeze-node's next to the hand) or paltry(h, object_0, 7) (but object_0 can only ever be 5 or 8 here because springs are only for 5 and 8). So producing next object_13 object_7 requires tightfisted with a sneeze node that has next ... 7. Only sneeze object_3 can have 7 (object_3's possible nexts are in {5,6,7}); sneeze object_4's group is {8,9,10} so it cannot provide 7.\n- tightfisted requires a vase between the hand and that sneeze node. Vase(h,3) can be created only by clip(h,3,x) when h and 3 both currently have next to the same x in {5,6,7}. But object_13 initially points to 10 (group {8,9,10}), so 13 does not have a next in {5,6,7}. To get 13 into {5,6,7} before clip would itself require a vase (paltry or tightfisted), so you get a circular dependency. Therefore you cannot create the needed vase13-3 and cannot get next 13 7.\n\nWhy next object_15 object_8 is unreachable (sketch)\n- To get next(15,8) you either need paltry(15,object_0,8) (object_0 can be 8 but paltry requires a vase 15\u2013object_0 which sip would create only if 15 already has next to the same value object_0 currently points to) or tightfisted(15,s,8) with a sneeze s that has next to 8 (only sneeze object_4 can have 8). Creating a vase between 15 and sneeze4 by clip requires both to share a successor x; 15 initially points to 6 and sneeze4 cannot be made to 6 (its group is {8,9,10}). So you cannot produce the necessary vase15-4, and the paltry/sip route is circular as well. Hence next(15,8) cannot be obtained.\n\nA plan that achieves the reachable subset (make next 11 5 and next 14 5; keep next 12 9 and next 16 6)\nThis plan uses the memory \u2194 sip \u2194 paltry trick: flip object_0 from 5 to 8 so we can create vase(hand,object_0) for hands that already have next=8, then flip object_0 back to 5 and use paltry to copy the 5 to the hand.\n\n1) memory object_0 object_5 object_8\n   - makes next object_0 object_8 (object_0 no longer points to 5)\n\n2) sip object_11 object_0 object_8\n   - pre: next 11 8 and next 0 8 -> creates vase 11 0\n\n(prepare hand 14 so it can match object_0=8)\n3) clip object_14 object_4 object_9\n   - pre: next 14 9 and next 4 9 -> creates vase 14 4 (deletes next14 9)\n\n4) wretched object_4 object_9 object_8 object_2\n   - changes next 4 9 -> next 4 8\n\n5) tightfisted object_14 object_4 object_8\n   - uses vase 14 4 and next 4 8 to give next 14 8\n\n6) sip object_14 object_0 object_8\n   - pre: next14 8 and next0 8 -> creates vase 14 0\n\n(flip object_0 back to 5 so paltry can copy 5)\n7) memory object_0 object_8 object_5\n   - makes next object_0 object_5 again\n\n8) paltry object_11 object_0 object_5\n   - uses vase11-0 and next0-5 to establish next11 5 (deletes vase11-0)\n\n9) paltry object_14 object_0 object_5\n   - uses vase14-0 and next0-5 to establish next14 5 (deletes vase14-0)\n\nAfter step 9 the state satisfies:\n- next object_11 object_5 (goal achieved)\n- next object_14 object_5 (goal achieved)\n- next object_12 object_9 (unchanged; goal satisfied from initial state)\n- next object_16 object_6 (unchanged; goal satisfied from initial state)\n\nBut next object_13 object_7 and next object_15 object_8 are not reached; as argued above they are unreachable from the given initial facts and available actions.\n\nIf you want:\n- I can produce the formal action sequence above in the exact requested [PLAN] format.\n- Or I can try to find an alternative goal assignment that is reachable, or propose minimal changes to initial facts (e.g., give object_13 an initial next in {5,6,7} or provide an extra collect linking so a sneeze can be repositioned) that would make the full goal reachable.\n\nWhich would you prefer?"

Adds vase(11,0) and deletes next(11,8).\n- Step 2 (memory 0 8 9): uses cats(0), spring(8), spring(9), next(0,8) (still true). Adds next(0,9).\n- Step 3 (paltry 11 0 9): uses hand(11), cats(0), texture(9), vase(11,0) (from step 1), and next(0,9) (from step 2). Adds next(11,9) (the needed goal) and deletes vase(11,0).\n\nnext(10,9) was already true and none of these steps delete it, so both goals hold at the end."
