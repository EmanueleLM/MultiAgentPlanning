FINAL-PLAN
------------------------------
I don't yet have the individual agents' structured action models or the initial state facts needed to build the combined PDDL domain + problem. Please provide the structured inputs from each agent (paltry_agent, sip_agent, clip_agent, wretched_agent, memory_agent, tightfisted_agent) and the initial statements. I will then reconcile names, preserve each agent's action names, encode constraints as hard constraints, and produce a FastDownwards-compatible domain and problem with the goal:
next object_8 object_6

To make this fast and unambiguous, please give each agent's model in the following template (repeat for each agent):

Agent: paltry_agent
Predicates used:
- (predicate-name ?params...)  ; list all predicate signatures this agent uses

Actions:
- action-name
  parameters: (?p1 - type1 ?p2 - type2 ...)
  preconditions:
  - (pred1 ?args)
  - (not (pred2 ?args))
  add-effects:
  - (pred3 ?args)
  del-effects:
  - (pred4 ?args)

(Repeat for each action the agent provides)

Objects (global list you want in the problem):
- object_1 - typeX
- object_2 - typeX
... (must include object_6 and object_8)

Initial facts (I will treat all "would rather / prefer / avoid" as hard constraints unless you tell me otherwise):
- (pred ?args)
- (not (pred ?args))   ; explicit negations if needed
- (available-slot slot1)  ; any facts relevant to timing/availability

Timing / temporal constraints (if any):
- e.g., "action A must be before action B" or "slot S unavailable at times 3-5" — provide as facts or explicit constraints.

Notes on naming conflicts or synonyms (optional but helpful):
- e.g., "paltry_agent uses (at ?x ?y) while memory_agent uses (located ?x ?y) — treat as the same predicate 'at'." If you do not specify, I'll resolve by renaming and documenting choices in PDDL comments.

Additional requirements:
- If any actions are durative / require numeric time, say so. Otherwise I will produce a STRIPS-style domain (:requirements :strips :typing :negative-preconditions) compatible with FastDownwards.
- If any predicate should be typed, give types; otherwise I'll use a minimal typing scheme (e.g., object, location, slot, agent).

Once you provide these items, I'll produce:
- A single PDDL domain enclosed in <domain>...</domain> including all predicates, types, and each agent's actions (with names prefixed or otherwise kept distinct).
- A single PDDL problem enclosed in <problem>...</problem> with objects, initial state, and the goal (next object_8 object_6).
- Inline comments in the PDDL (where supported by the format) documenting any naming resolutions or decisions I make.

If you prefer, you can paste the agents' structured models directly and I will proceed.

FINAL-PLAN
------------------------------
I don’t yet have the structured outputs from planner1 and planner2 you referenced. To produce an accurate, integrated PDDL domain and problem that respect the planners’ discovered preconditions/effects, object sets, initial facts, and goals, I need those planner analyses (the structured summaries).

Please either:
- Paste the structured outputs from planner1 and planner2 (their object lists, predicates, actions with preconditions/effects, initial facts, and goals), or
- Tell me I should proceed by making a best-effort (assumption-based) integration for the six named actions (paltry, sip, clip, wretched, memory, tightfisted). If you choose this, I will state all assumptions I make and produce PDDL accordingly.

If you want me to assume and generate now, useful clarifying details to supply or confirm:
- Agent names (one or many) and whether actions are agent-specific (e.g., paltry_by_agent1 vs paltry_by_agent2) or shared.
- The domain objects and types (e.g., items, cups, clips, memories, slots, resources, locations).
- Which goals from planner1 and planner2 must both be satisfied (list them).
- Any hard temporal constraints (e.g., orderings, earliest times, unavailable slots) that should be encoded as strict constraints.
- Any predicates the planners used (e.g., at, has, clipped, remembered, tight, free-slot).

If you want me to proceed with a reasonable default integration, say “Proceed with assumptions” and I will: 
- Define types agent, item, cup, clip, memory, slot.
- Create predicates and actions named exactly paltry, sip, clip, wretched, memory, tightfisted, keeping separate agent parameters where relevant.
- Produce a FastDownward-compatible classical PDDL domain and a problem using a combined hypothetical object set and combined goals, and list all assumptions at top of the output.

================================================================================


FINAL-PLAN
------------------------------
Player1 plan analysis (compact, machine-friendly):

Initial facts (player1):
cats o0
collect o5 o1
collect o6 o2
hand o7
hand o8
next o0 o6
next o3 o5
next o4 o6
next o7 o6
next o8 o6
sneeze o3
sneeze o4
spring o5
spring o6
stupendous o1
stupendous o2
texture o5
texture o6

Planned sequence:
1) sip o8 o0 o6
   preconditions: hand o8, cats o0, texture o6, next o8 o6, next o0 o6
   effects: add vase o8 o0; del next o8 o6
   preconditions satisfied at execution time: YES (all present)
   state changes: next o8 o6 removed; vase o8 o0 added

2) sip o7 o0 o6
   preconditions: hand o7, cats o0, texture o6, next o7 o6, next o0 o6
   effects: add vase o7 o0; del next o7 o6
   preconditions satisfied at execution time: YES (next o7 o6 present; next o0 o6 still present)
   state changes: next o7 o6 removed; vase o7 o0 added

3) memory o0 o6 o5
   preconditions: cats o0, spring o6, spring o5, next o0 o6
   effects: add next o0 o5; del next o0 o6
   preconditions satisfied at execution time: YES (next o0 o6 still present)
   state changes: next o0 o6 removed; next o0 o5 added

4) paltry o8 o0 o5
   preconditions: hand o8, cats o0, texture o5, vase o8 o0, next o0 o5
   effects: add next o8 o5; del vase o8 o0
   preconditions satisfied at execution time: YES (vase o8 o0 created by step1; next o0 o5 created by step3)
   state changes: vase o8 o0 removed; next o8 o5 added

5) paltry o7 o0 o5
   preconditions: hand o7, cats o0, texture o5, vase o7 o0, next o0 o5
   effects: add next o7 o5; del vase o7 o0
   preconditions satisfied at execution time: YES (vase o7 o0 created by step2; next o0 o5 created by step3)
   state changes: vase o7 o0 removed; next o7 o5 added

Goal (player1): next o7 o5 AND next o8 o5
Result: Both goals produced by the plan (step4 produces next o8 o5; step5 produces next o7 o5). No missing facts or contradictions found in player1 local analysis. Plan is internally consistent and feasible given the provided public action schemas and player1 initial facts.

Player2 feasibility analysis (compact, machine-friendly):

Initial facts (player2):
cats o0
cats o1
collect o6 o2
collect o7 o3
hand o8
hand o9
next o0 o6
next o1 o6
next o4 o6
next o5 o7
next o8 o7
next o9 o7
sneeze o4
sneeze o5
spring o6
spring o7
stupendous o2
stupendous o3
texture o6
texture o7

Goal (player2): next o8 o7 AND next o9 o6

- next o8 o7 already present in initial facts (satisfied).
- Need to realize next o9 o6.

Actions that can add a next predicate (public schemas):
- paltry adds next ?x ?z but requires vase ?x ?y and next ?y ?z, and hand and cats and texture.
- memory adds next ?x ?z but requires cats ?x, spring ?y and spring ?z, and next ?x ?y.
- wretched adds next ?x ?z but requires sneeze ?x (the same ?x to be advanced), textures, stupendous ?w, next ?x ?y, and collect ?y ?w, collect ?z ?w.
- tightfisted adds next ?x ?z but requires vase ?x ?y, next ?y ?z, hand ?x, sneeze ?y, texture ?z.

To produce next o9 o6, candidate actions:
- memory requires cats o9 (not present) => memory cannot produce next o9 o6.
- wretched would require sneeze o9 (not present) => cannot.
- paltry/tightfisted require a vase with subject o9 (vase o9 ?y). Vase creation options are sip and clip:
   - sip creates vase ?x ?y but requires next ?x ?z and next ?y ?z (for same z) — requires next o9 o6 to pre-exist.
   - clip creates vase ?x ?y but requires next ?x ?z and next ?y ?z — again requires next o9 o6 to pre-exist.

Conclusion:
- There is a circular dependency: creating any vase with subject o9 (vase o9 ...) requires next o9 z to already exist; adding next o9 o6 via paltry/tightfisted requires an existing vase o9 y or next o9 something for sip/clip; memory/wretched require predicates (cats o9 or sneeze o9) that are not present. No available action sequence from player2's initial facts can produce next o9 o6 without introducing new initial facts not provided.
- Therefore next o9 o6 is unreachable given only player2's initial facts and the public action schemas.
- next o8 o7 is already satisfied.

Combined-decision note:
- Use full union of both agents' initial facts for the global instance.
- Include all public action schemas unchanged.
- Include both agents' goals as hard goals (even if some are unreachable from the combined initial state under provided operators).

PDDL domain and problem (STRIPS) ready for Fast Downward follow. Domain encodes the public action schemas exactly; problem encodes the union of initial facts from both agents and the combined goals.

NATURAL-PLAN sas_plan_0
------------------------------
Summary: the following is a human-readable, step-by-step rendering of the given plan. Each step lists a timestamp (one time unit per action), the action and its parameters, the schema preconditions checked against the current state, the effects applied, and a short confirmation. The sequence exactly matches the provided plan (9 actions, unit cost each; total cost = 9).

Initial relevant facts (excerpted from the combined initial state before step 0)
- cats: object_0, object_1
- hand: object_7, object_8, object_9
- texture: object_5, object_6, object_7
- spring: object_5, object_6, object_7
- sneeze: object_3, object_4, object_5
- stupendous: object_1, object_2, object_3
- collect: (object_5 → object_1), (object_6 → object_2), (object_7 → object_3)
- next relations initially include (relevant subset):
  next object_0 object_6
  next object_1 object_6
  next object_5 object_7
  next object_7 object_6
  next object_8 object_6
  next object_8 object_7
  next object_9 object_7
- no vase facts initially

Plan (timestamps t = 0..8; each step duration = 1 time unit)

Step 1 — t=0 — sip object_8 object_1 object_6
- Schema sip(?x ?y ?z)
  - Preconditions required: hand ?x, cats ?y, texture ?z, next ?x ?z, next ?y ?z
- Instantiated preconditions checked:
  - hand object_8 — TRUE
  - cats object_1 — TRUE
  - texture object_6 — TRUE
  - next object_8 object_6 — TRUE
  - next object_1 object_6 — TRUE
- Effects applied:
  - add (vase object_8 object_1)
  - delete (next object_8 object_6)
- Confirmation: action valid and executed. next(object_8,object_6) removed; vase(object_8,object_1) added.

Step 2 — t=1 — sip object_7 object_1 object_6
- Schema sip(?x ?y ?z)
  - Preconditions required: hand object_7, cats object_1, texture object_6, next object_7 object_6, next object_1 object_6
- Instantiated preconditions:
  - hand object_7 — TRUE
  - cats object_1 — TRUE
  - texture object_6 — TRUE
  - next object_7 object_6 — TRUE
  - next object_1 object_6 — TRUE
- Effects applied:
  - add (vase object_7 object_1)
  - delete (next object_7 object_6)
- Confirmation: action valid and executed. next(object_7,object_6) removed; vase(object_7,object_1) added.

Step 3 — t=2 — memory object_1 object_6 object_5
- Schema memory(?x ?y ?z)
  - Preconditions required: cats ?x, spring ?y, spring ?z, next ?x ?y
- Instantiated preconditions:
  - cats object_1 — TRUE
  - spring object_6 — TRUE
  - spring object_5 — TRUE
  - next object_1 object_6 — TRUE
- Effects applied:
  - add (next object_1 object_5)
  - delete (next object_1 object_6)
- Confirmation: action valid and executed. next(object_1,object_6) removed; next(object_1,object_5) added.

Step 4 — t=3 — paltry object_8 object_1 object_5
- Schema paltry(?x ?y ?z)
  - Preconditions required: hand ?x, cats ?y, texture ?z, vase ?x ?y, next ?y ?z
- Instantiated preconditions:
  - hand object_8 — TRUE
  - cats object_1 — TRUE
  - texture object_5 — TRUE
  - vase object_8 object_1 — TRUE (added in Step 1)
  - next object_1 object_5 — TRUE (added in Step 3)
- Effects applied:
  - add (next object_8 object_5)
  - delete (vase object_8 object_1)
- Confirmation: action valid and executed. next(object_8,object_5) added; vase(object_8,object_1) removed.

Step 5 — t=4 — paltry object_7 object_1 object_5
- Schema paltry(?x ?y ?z)
  - Preconditions required: hand ?x, cats ?y, texture ?z, vase ?x ?y, next ?y ?z
- Instantiated preconditions:
  - hand object_7 — TRUE
  - cats object_1 — TRUE
  - texture object_5 — TRUE
  - vase object_7 object_1 — TRUE (added in Step 2)
  - next object_1 object_5 — TRUE (still TRUE from Step 3)
- Effects applied:
  - add (next object_7 object_5)
  - delete (vase object_7 object_1)
- Confirmation: action valid and executed. next(object_7,object_5) added; vase(object_7,object_1) removed.

At this point player1's goals are satisfied:
- next object_7 object_5 — TRUE (added Step 5)
- next object_8 object_5 — TRUE (added Step 4)

Step 6 — t=5 — memory object_1 object_5 object_7
- Schema memory(?x ?y ?z)
  - Preconditions required: cats ?x, spring ?y, spring ?z, next ?x ?y
- Instantiated preconditions:
  - cats object_1 — TRUE
  - spring object_5 — TRUE
  - spring object_7 — TRUE
  - next object_1 object_5 — TRUE (from Step 3; still true until removed)
- Effects applied:
  - add (next object_1 object_7)
  - delete (next object_1 object_5)
- Confirmation: action valid and executed. next(object_1,object_7) added; next(object_1,object_5) removed.

Step 7 — t=6 — sip object_9 object_1 object_7
- Schema sip(?x ?y ?z)
  - Preconditions required: hand ?x, cats ?y, texture ?z, next ?x ?z, next ?y ?z

  - hand object_9 — TRUE
  - cats object_1 — TRUE
  - texture object_7 — TRUE
  - next object_9 object_7 — TRUE (initial)
  - next object_1 object_7 — TRUE (added Step 6)
- Effects applied:
  - add (vase object_9 object_1)
  - delete (next object_9 object_7)
- Confirmation: action valid and executed. next(object_9,object_7) removed; vase(object_9,object_1) added.

Step 8 — t=7 — memory object_1 object_7 object_6
- Schema memory(?x ?y ?z)
  - Preconditions required: cats ?x, spring ?y, spring ?z, next ?x ?y
- Instantiated preconditions:
  - cats object_1 — TRUE
  - spring object_7 — TRUE
  - spring object_6 — TRUE
  - next object_1 object_7 — TRUE (added Step 6; still present)
- Effects applied:
  - add (next object_1 object_6)
  - delete (next object_1 object_7)
- Confirmation: action valid and executed. next(object_1,object_6) re-added; next(object_1,object_7) removed.

Step 9 — t=8 — paltry object_9 object_1 object_6
- Schema paltry(?x ?y ?z)
  - Preconditions required: hand ?x, cats ?y, texture ?z, vase ?x ?y, next ?y ?z
- Instantiated preconditions:
  - hand object_9 — TRUE
  - cats object_1 — TRUE
  - texture object_6 — TRUE
  - vase object_9 object_1 — TRUE (added Step 7)
  - next object_1 object_6 — TRUE (added Step 8)
- Effects applied:
  - add (next object_9 object_6)
  - delete (vase object_9 object_1)
- Confirmation: action valid and executed. next(object_9,object_6) added; vase(object_9,object_1) removed.

Final relevant state (after step 9) — goals check
- next object_7 object_5 — TRUE (achieved Step 5)
- next object_8 object_5 — TRUE (achieved Step 4)
- next object_8 object_7 — TRUE (remained from initial state; never deleted)
- next object_9 object_6 — TRUE (achieved Step 9)

All required goals are satisfied:
- player1 goals: next object_7 object_5 and next object_8 object_5 — satisfied
- player2 goals: next object_8 object_7 and next object_9 object_6 — satisfied

Plan cost: 9 (unit cost per action), total cost = 9.

Notes
- Every action in the provided plan was executed in order, and for each the required preconditions were present at the time of execution.
- The plan does not introduce any contradictions with the public action schemas; all delete/add effects were applied consistently and needed preconditions were available when actions were executed.

Tightfisted object_0 object_1 object_2.

I have the following restrictions on my actions:
To perform paltry action, the following facts need to be true: hand object_0, cats object_1, texture object_2, vase object_0 object_1, and next object_1 object_2
Once paltry is performed the following facts will be true: next object_0 object_2
Once paltry is performed the following facts will be false: vase object_0 object_1
To perform sip action, the following facts need to be true: hand object_0, cats object_1, texture object_2, next object_0 object_2, and next object_1 object_2
Once sip is performed the following facts will be true: vase object_0 object_1
Once sip is performed the following facts will be false: next object_0 object_2
To perform clip action, the following facts need to be true: hand object_0, sneeze object_1, texture object_2, next object_1 object_2, and next object_0 object_2
Once clip is performed the following facts will be true: vase object_0 object_1
Once clip is performed the following facts will be false: next object_0 object_2
To perform wretched action, the following facts need to be true: sneeze object_0, texture object_1, texture object_2, stupendous object_3, next object_0 object_1, collect object_1 object_3, and collect object_2 object_3
Once wretched is performed the following facts will be true: next object_0 object_2
Once wretched is performed the following facts will be false: next object_0 object_1
To perform memory action, the following facts need to be true: cats object_0, spring object_1, spring object_2, and next object_0 object_1

FINAL-PLAN
------------------------------
I don't have the player_analysis or observer_analysis inputs yet. I need those to integrate findings and produce the PDDL domain + problem. Please provide:

- player_analysis output (capabilities, goals, constraints, any chosen actions or preferences).
- observer_analysis output (environment->public_information, observed initial facts, any inferred constraints or unavailable slots).
- If a specific scenario / goal was selected, state which one; otherwise specify the desired goal for the problem.
- Any hard constraints or timing preferences that must be treated as strict.

If helpful, paste the analyses in this form (example):

player_analysis:
- agents: agent1 (capabilities...), agent2 (capabilities...)
- goals: agent1 -> achieve X by time T; agent2 -> achieve Y
- constraints: agent1 cannot use resource R at time 3; preferences treated as hard

observer_analysis:
- environment->public_information: predicates such as (connected loc1 loc2), (available resource R), (time-slot free t1)
- initial facts: list of grounded predicates present initially
- unavailable slots/resources: list

If any facts are unknown, indicate whether I should assume them false or provide defaults.

Once you supply the analyses, I'll (1) document any ambiguity and my resolution choices, and (2) produce FastDownward-compatible PDDL domain and problem files enclosed in <domain> and <problem> tags.

NATURAL-PLAN sas_plan_1
------------------------------
Summary: execute the given 3-step plan in order. Each step shows parameter mapping, precondition check, effects applied, and the resulting relevant facts. I use simple timestamps (start at t=0s) and assume each action takes 1.0s.

Step 1 — t=0.0s (duration 1.0s)
- Action: clip(object_9, object_4, object_7)
- Parameter mapping:
  - object_0 -> object_9
  - object_1 -> object_4
  - object_2 -> object_7
- Preconditions (required / satisfied):
  - (hand object_9) — present ✓
  - (sneeze object_4) — present ✓
  - (texture object_7) — present ✓
  - (next object_4 object_7) — present ✓
  - (next object_9 object_7) — present ✓
  => All preconditions satisfied.
- Effects applied:
  - Add: (vase object_9 object_4)
  - Remove: (next object_9 object_7)
- Resulting relevant facts after Step 1 (changes only):
  - (vase object_9 object_4) is now true.
  - (next object_9 object_7) has been removed (no longer true).
  - All other initial facts remain unchanged.

Step 2 — t=1.0s (duration 1.0s)
- Action: wretched(object_4, object_7, object_8, object_2)
- Parameter mapping:
  - object_0 -> object_4
  - object_1 -> object_7
  - object_2 -> object_8
  - object_3 -> object_2
- Preconditions (required / satisfied):
  - (sneeze object_4) — present ✓
  - (texture object_7) — present ✓
  - (texture object_8) — present ✓
  - (stupendous object_2) — present ✓
  - (next object_4 object_7) — present ✓
  - (collect object_7 object_2) — present ✓
  - (collect object_8 object_2) — present ✓
  => All preconditions satisfied.
- Effects applied:
  - Add: (next object_4 object_8)
  - Remove: (next object_4 object_7)
- Resulting relevant facts after Step 2 (changes cumulative):
  - (next object_4 object_8) is now true.
  - (next object_4 object_7) has been removed.
  - (vase object_9 object_4) from Step 1 remains true.
  - (next object_9 object_7) remains removed.

Step 3 — t=2.0s (duration 1.0s)
- Action: tightfisted(object_9, object_4, object_8)
- Parameter mapping:
  - object_0 -> object_9
  - object_1 -> object_4
  - object_2 -> object_8
- Preconditions (required / satisfied):
  - (hand object_9) — present ✓
  - (sneeze object_4) — present ✓
  - (texture object_8) — present ✓
  - (next object_4 object_8) — present ✓ (added in Step 2) ✓
  - (vase object_9 object_4) — present ✓ (added in Step 1) ✓
  => All preconditions satisfied.
- Effects applied:
  - Add: (next object_9 object_8)
  - Remove: (vase object_9 object_4)
- Resulting relevant facts after Step 3 (final relevant facts):
  - (next object_9 object_8) is now true — this achieves the goal.
  - (vase object_9 object_4) has been removed.
  - (next object_4 object_8) remains true (from Step 2).
  - Other initial facts remain as originally stated except those explicitly removed above.

Goal check
- Goal: (next object_9 object_8)
- Status after Step 3: achieved ✓

Notes / assumptions
- Each action was executed in the exact order provided by the plan and each action duration was assumed 1.0 second for clarity.
- No additional actions or facts were introduced beyond the plan effects and the initial facts.

NATURAL-PLAN sas_plan_0
------------------------------
Plan summary (3 steps, unit cost each; timestamps are illustrative — each action takes 1 time unit):

Step 1 — t = 0 → 1
Action: clip object_9 object_4 object_6
- Parameters: actor/object o0=object_9, target sneeze o1=object_4, texture o2=object_6
- Preconditions (checked against the initial state):
  - (hand object_9) — present
  - (sneeze object_4) — present
  - (texture object_6) — present
  - (next object_4 object_6) — present
  - (next object_9 object_6) — present
  ⇒ All preconditions satisfied.
- Effects:
  - Add: (vase object_9 object_4)
  - Delete: (next object_9 object_6)
- Local state change summary after step:
  - (vase object_9 object_4) is now true.
  - (next object_9 object_6) is now false (removed).
  - Other facts unchanged.

Step 2 — t = 1 → 2
Action: wretched object_4 object_6 object_7 object_2
- Parameters: o0=object_4, o1=object_6, o2=object_7, o3=object_2
- Preconditions:
  - (sneeze object_4) — present
  - (texture object_6) — present
  - (texture object_7) — present
  - (stupendous object_2) — present
  - (next object_4 object_6) — present (was true in the initial state and not changed by step 1)
  - (collect object_6 object_2) — present
  - (collect object_7 object_2) — present
  ⇒ All preconditions satisfied.
- Effects:
  - Add: (next object_4 object_7)
  - Delete: (next object_4 object_6)
- Local state change summary after step:
  - (next object_4 object_7) is now true.
  - (next object_4 object_6) is now false (removed).
  - (vase object_9 object_4) from step 1 remains true.

Step 3 — t = 2 → 3
Action: tightfisted object_9 object_4 object_7
- Parameters: o0=object_9, o1=object_4, o2=object_7
- Preconditions:
  - (hand object_9) — present
  - (sneeze object_4) — present
  - (texture object_7) — present
  - (next object_4 object_7) — present (established by Step 2)
  - (vase object_9 object_4) — present (established by Step 1)
  ⇒ All preconditions satisfied.
- Effects:
  - Add: (next object_9 object_7)
  - Delete: (vase object_9 object_4)
- Local state change summary after step:
  - (next object_9 object_7) is now true — this is the goal achieved.
  - (vase object_9 object_4) is removed.

Final check
- Goal (next object_9 object_7) is true after Step 3. The three planned actions were applied in order, all preconditions were satisfied when executed, and the final state achieves the required goal.

FINAL-PLAN
------------------------------
Comment (modeling decisions and summary)
- I produced a single PDDL domain encoding the six actions paltry, sip, clip, wretched, memory, tightfisted using the predicates and action semantics given by agents A and B.
- Parameter roles were made explicit and consistent:
  - paltry (?s ?x ?y): ?s = subject (must have hand), ?x = cats argument, ?y = texture argument.
  - sip (?s ?x ?y): ?s = subject (hand), ?x = cats argument, ?y = texture argument (note: sip creates vase ?s ?x and deletes next ?s ?y).
  - clip (?s ?x ?y): ?s = subject (hand), ?x = sneeze-arg, ?y = texture-arg (adds vase ?s ?x, deletes next ?s ?y).
  - wretched (?a ?b ?c ?d): ?a = sneeze-arg, ?b/?c = texture args, ?d = stupendous arg (adds next ?a ?c, deletes next ?a ?b).
  - memory (?a ?b ?c): ?a = cats arg, ?b/?c = spring args (adds next ?a ?c, deletes next ?a ?b).
  - tightfisted (?s ?x ?y): ?s = subject (hand), ?x = sneeze arg, ?y = texture arg (adds next ?s ?y, deletes vase ?s ?x).
- I preserved all predicates from the agents: hand, cats, texture, vase, next, sneeze, spring, collect, stupendous.
- I used only STRIPS-style preconditions and add/delete effects (no fluents, no durative actions, no conditional effects) so FastDownward (classical) can consume them.
- I generated two separate problem files (scenario_a and scenario_b) — one per agent scenario — to keep initial states and goals explicit and separate.
- Validation summary:
  - Scenario A: I validated agent_a's proposed 6-step plan against the initial facts and the action schemas. Every step's preconditions are satisfied when executed in sequence; the plan is valid and achieves goal (next object_10 object_6).
  - Scenario B: next object_10 object_5 is already true in the initial facts. next object_9 object_7 is not reachable with the given facts and actions because all ways to create next(9,7) require either:
    - a vase(9, X) together with next(X,7) and cats(X) (paltry/tightfisted), but vase(9, X) cannot be produced without already requiring a next involving 9 (circular), or
    - sneeze(9) (none present), or
    - collect/stupendous patterns required by wretched are not matched by the existing collect/stupendous pairs (no single stupendous object connects the two required collect facts).
  - Suggested missing facts or changes if next object_9 object_7 must be achieved:
    - Add sneeze object_9, or
    - Add a collect/vase/next combination that allows wretched or clip/sip to produce an intermediate next or vase for object_9; e.g., add collect X D and collect 7 D with appropriate stupendous D to enable wretched to produce next(3,7) then propagate to 9, or
    - Add next object_0 object_7 and vase object_9 object_0 (or other vase that makes paltry/tightfisted applicable).
- No agent-provided action definitions were expanded beyond the given semantics. I did not invent extra actions or implicit multi-hop effects.

Now the PDDL domain and problem files follow.

NATURAL-PLAN sas_plan_2
------------------------------
Summary schedule (each action 1 time unit, start t=0). I follow the given plan exactly and verify preconditions/effects against the initial facts and prior effects. All six actions are applicable in sequence and the final goal next object_10 object_6 is achieved.

0) t = 0 → 1 (action 1)
- Action: clip object_10 object_5 object_9
- Plain English: With hand object_10, use object_5 (a sneeze) and object_9 (a texture) that are linked (next object_5 object_9) and object_10 is also linked to object_9 (next object_10 object_9) to create vase object_10 object_5 and remove the link next object_10 object_9.
- Preconditions checked at t=0: (hand object_10), (sneeze object_5), (texture object_9), (next object_5 object_9), (next object_10 object_9) — all present in the initial state.
- Effects applied: add (vase object_10 object_5); delete (next object_10 object_9).

1) t = 1 → 2 (action 2)
- Action: wretched object_5 object_9 object_8 object_3
- Plain English: Using sneeze object_5, textures object_9 and object_8, and stupendous object_3, and given next object_5 object_9 plus collect object_9 object_3 and collect object_8 object_3, change the link from object_5→object_9 to object_5→object_8.
- Preconditions checked at t=1: (sneeze object_5), (texture object_9), (texture object_8), (stupendous object_3), (next object_5 object_9) and (collect object_9 object_3), (collect object_8 object_3) — all present (next object_5 object_9 was not touched by step 1).
- Effects applied: add (next object_5 object_8); delete (next object_5 object_9).

2) t = 2 → 3 (action 3)
- Action: tightfisted object_10 object_5 object_8
- Plain English: With hand object_10 and vase object_10 object_5, and given sneeze object_5 and texture object_8 and link next object_5 object_8, change to link next object_10 object_8 and remove the vase object_10 object_5.
- Preconditions checked at t=2: (hand object_10) present, (sneeze object_5) present, (texture object_8) present, (next object_5 object_8) added in step 2, (vase object_10 object_5) added in step 1 — all satisfied.
- Effects applied: add (next object_10 object_8); delete (vase object_10 object_5).

3) t = 3 → 4 (action 4)
- Action: sip object_10 object_0 object_8
- Plain English: With hand object_10, cats object_0 and texture object_8, and given next object_10 object_8 and next object_0 object_8, create vase object_10 object_0 and remove next object_10 object_8.
- Preconditions checked at t=3: (hand object_10), (cats object_0), (texture object_8), (next object_10 object_8) from step 3, (next object_0 object_8) from the initial state — satisfied.
- Effects applied: add (vase object_10 object_0); delete (next object_10 object_8).

4) t = 4 → 5 (action 5)
- Action: memory object_0 object_8 object_6
- Plain English: Using cats object_0 and springs object_8 and object_6, and link next object_0 object_8, change the link to next object_0 object_6 (i.e., replace object_0→object_8 by object_0→object_6).
- Preconditions checked at t=4: (cats object_0) initial, (spring object_8) initial, (spring object_6) initial, (next object_0 object_8) initial and not yet deleted — satisfied.
- Effects applied: add (next object_0 object_6); delete (next object_0 object_8).

5) t = 5 → 6 (action 6)
- Action: paltry object_10 object_0 object_6
- Plain English: With hand object_10, cats object_0 and texture object_6, given vase object_10 object_0 and next object_0 object_6, produce link next object_10 object_6 and remove vase object_10 object_0.
- Preconditions checked at t=5: (hand object_10) present, (cats object_0) present, (texture object_6) present, (vase object_10 object_0) added in step 4, (next object_0 object_6) added in step 5 — all satisfied.
- Effects applied: add (next object_10 object_6); delete (vase object_10 object_0).

Final state and goal
- After step 6 (t = 6) the predicate (next object_10 object_6) has been added.
- The goal (next object_10 object_6) is achieved.
- No missing facts or unmet preconditions occurred during execution: every step's preconditions were satisfied by the initial facts plus effects of prior actions in the exact order given.

Notes about timing and costs
- I used 1 time unit per action (consistent with unit cost = 6). If other durations are required, they can be substituted, but the order must remain identical to preserve precondition/effect dependencies.

I don't have the contents of analysis_A and analysis_B you referred to. I can't reliably invent agent capabilities, time windows, availabilities, or constraints you meant to capture — and your instructions require treating natural-language preferences as hard constraints and not inventing availability data.

Please provide the text of analysis_A and analysis_B (or a clear summary of each) including:
- Agents (names)
- Objects/resources (e.g., rooms, slots, items)
- Discrete time slots or numeric times and which slots are unavailable
- Actions each agent can take, with their preconditions and effects (or a clear natural-language description I can encode)
- Hard constraints or preferences to be enforced as strict constraints (e.g., "Agent A must be scheduled before 10", "Slot 3 is unavailable", "Agent B cannot use resource R")
- Which scenarios to encode (two separate initial states/goals, or one scenario that is solvable)
- Any mutual-exclusion or sequencing constraints between agents

If you prefer, paste the two analyses and I'll:
1. Integrate them and resolve naming ambiguities.
2. Produce a single PDDL domain (with types, predicates, and actions for each agent) wrapped in <domain></domain> tags.
3. Produce one or two FastDownwards-compatible PDDL problem files (each wrapped in <problem></problem> tags with a top-line comment ";; FastDownwards") encoding the initial facts and goals.
4. Ensure constraints from natural-language preferences become hard constraints (e.g., forbid use of unavailable slots; enforce earliest feasible times).
5. Keep agent-level actions distinct and explicit.

If you'd like, I can also provide a concrete example template now (a small scheduling domain + sample problem) so you can confirm the encoding style before I generate the full integrated files. Which do you prefer?

NATURAL-PLAN sas_plan_0
------------------------------
Below is a clear, step-by-step human-readable execution of the given plan. Steps are listed in the exact order of the plan. For each step I show: time (incremental), the action and its object arguments, which preconditions were satisfied at that moment, and the immediate effects (facts added and facts removed). At the end I confirm the goal facts are achieved.

Time 0s — Step 1:
Action: clip object_9 object_3 object_5
- Preconditions satisfied: hand(object_9), sneeze(object_3), texture(object_5), next(object_3, object_5), next(object_9, object_5).
- Effects: add vase(object_9, object_3); remove next(object_9, object_5).
- Notes: object_9 creates a vase relation with object_3; the previous next link from object_9 to object_5 is removed.

Time 10s — Step 2:
Action: wretched object_3 object_5 object_6 object_1
- Preconditions satisfied: sneeze(object_3), texture(object_5), texture(object_6), stupendous(object_1), next(object_3, object_5), collect(object_5, object_1), collect(object_6, object_1).
- Effects: add next(object_3, object_6); remove next(object_3, object_5).
- Notes: object_3’s next pointer moves from object_5 to object_6.

Time 20s — Step 3:
Action: tightfisted object_9 object_3 object_6
- Preconditions satisfied: hand(object_9), sneeze(object_3), texture(object_6), next(object_3, object_6), vase(object_9, object_3).
- Effects: add next(object_9, object_6); remove vase(object_9, object_3).
- Notes: object_9’s next now points to object_6 (goal-related fact); the vase relation with object_3 is consumed/removed.

Time 30s — Step 4:
Action: sip object_10 object_0 object_5
- Preconditions satisfied: hand(object_10), cats(object_0), texture(object_5), next(object_10, object_5), next(object_0, object_5).
- Effects: add vase(object_10, object_0); remove next(object_10, object_5).
- Notes: object_10 forms a vase relation with object_0; object_10’s previous next-to-object_5 is removed.

Time 40s — Step 5:
Action: memory object_0 object_5 object_7
- Preconditions satisfied: cats(object_0), spring(object_5), spring(object_7), next(object_0, object_5).
- Effects: add next(object_0, object_7); remove next(object_0, object_5).
- Notes: object_0’s next pointer is updated from object_5 to object_7.

Time 50s — Step 6:
Action: paltry object_10 object_0 object_7
- Preconditions satisfied: hand(object_10), cats(object_0), texture(object_7), vase(object_10, object_0), next(object_0, object_7).
- Effects: add next(object_10, object_7); remove vase(object_10, object_0).
- Notes: object_10’s next now points to object_7 (this achieves next object_10 → object_7).

Time 60s — Step 7:
Action: wretched object_5 object_8 object_9 object_3
- Preconditions satisfied: sneeze(object_5), texture(object_8), texture(object_9), stupendous(object_3), next(object_5, object_8), collect(object_8, object_3), collect(object_9, object_3).
- Effects: add next(object_5, object_9); remove next(object_5, object_8).
- Notes: object_5’s next is changed from object_8 to object_9.

Time 70s — Step 8:
Action: clip object_11 object_5 object_9
- Preconditions satisfied: hand(object_11), sneeze(object_5), texture(object_9), next(object_5, object_9), next(object_11, object_9).
- Effects: add vase(object_11, object_5); remove next(object_11, object_9).
- Notes: object_11 forms a vase relation with object_5; its next link to object_9 is removed.

Time 80s — Step 9:
Action: wretched object_5 object_9 object_8 object_3
- Preconditions satisfied: sneeze(object_5), texture(object_9), texture(object_8), stupendous(object_3), next(object_5, object_9), collect(object_9, object_3), collect(object_8, object_3).
- Effects: add next(object_5, object_8); remove next(object_5, object_9).
- Notes: object_5’s next is changed back to object_8 (restoring that relation).

Time 90s — Step 10:
Action: tightfisted object_11 object_5 object_8
- Preconditions satisfied: hand(object_11), sneeze(object_5), texture(object_8), next(object_5, object_8), vase(object_11, object_5).
- Effects: add next(object_11, object_8); remove vase(object_11, object_5).
- Notes: object_11’s next now points to object_8 (this achieves next object_11 → object_8).

Final check (after Step 10):
- next(object_10, object_6): true (present initially and never removed).
- next(object_9, object_6): true (added at Step 3).
- next(object_10, object_7): true (added at Step 6).
- next(object_11, object_8): true (added at Step 10).

All four goal facts are achieved by the above sequence.

Clip object_0 object_1 object_2.
Wretched object_0 object_1 object_2 object_3.
Memory object_0 object_1 object_2.
Tightfisted object_0 object_1 object_2.

I have the following restrictions on my actions:
To perform paltry action, the following facts need to be true: hand object_0, cats object_1, texture object_2, vase object_0 object_1, and next object_1 object_2
Once paltry is performed the following facts will be true: next object_0 object_2
Once paltry is performed the following facts will be false: vase object_0 object_1
To perform sip action, the following facts need to be true: hand object_0, cats object_1, texture object_2, next object_0 object_2, and next object_1 object_2
Once sip is performed the following facts will be true: vase object_0 object_1
Once sip is performed the following facts will be false: next object_0 object_2
To perform clip action, the following facts need to be true: hand object_0, sneeze object_1, texture object_2, next object_1 object_2, and next object_0 object_2
Once clip is performed the following facts will be true: vase object_0 object_1
Once clip is performed the following facts will be false: next object_0 object_2
To perform wretched action, the following facts need to be true: sneeze object_0, texture object_1, texture object_2, stupendous object_3, next object_0 object_1, collect object_1 object_3, and collect object_2 object_3
Once wretched is performed the following facts will be true: next object_0 object_2

ENVIRONMENT
------------------------------
I am playing with a set of objects. Here are the actions I can do

Paltry object_0 object_1 object_2.
Sip object_0 object_1 object_2.
Clip object_0 object_1 object_2.
Wretched object_0 object_1 object_2 object_3.
Memory object_0 object_1 object_2.
Tightfisted object_0 object_1 object_2.

I have the following restrictions on my actions:
To perform paltry action, the following facts need to be true: hand object_0, cats object_1, texture object_2, vase object_0 object_1, and next object_1 object_2
Once paltry is performed the following facts will be true: next object_0 object_2

To perform sip action, the following facts need to be true: hand object_0, cats object_1, texture object_2, next object_0 object_2, and next object_1 object_2
Once sip is performed the following facts will be true: vase object_0 object_1
Once sip is performed the following facts will be false: next object_0 object_2
To perform clip action, the following facts need to be true: hand object_0, sneeze object_1, texture object_2, next object_1 object_2, and next object_0 object_2
Once clip is performed the following facts will be true: vase object_0 object_1

To perform memory action, the following facts need to be true: cats object_0, spring object_1, spring object_2, and next object_0 object_1
Once memory is performed the following facts will be true: next object_0 object_2
Once memory is performed the following facts will be false: next object_0 object_1
To perform tightfisted action, the following facts need to be true: hand object_0, sneeze object_1, texture object_2, next object_1 object_2, and vase object_0 object_1
Once tightfisted is performed the following facts will be true: next object_0 object_2
Once tightfisted is performed the following facts will be false: vase object_0 object_1

NATURAL-PLAN sas_plan_3
------------------------------
Summary: No actions are required. The initial state already satisfies every goal predicate, so the plan is empty (0 actions).

Plan (0 steps)
- Timestamp 0.0, duration 0.0 — No-op: start state already meets the goal; no actions executed.

Verification (each goal fact is present in the initial state)
- Goal: (next object_0 object_8) — present in init.
- Goal: (next object_0 object_5) — present in init.
- Goal: (next object_1 object_6) — present in init.
- Goal: (next object_3 object_5) — present in init.
- Goal: (next object_4 object_6) — present in init.
- Goal: (next object_4 object_7) — present in init.
- Goal: (next object_5 object_8) — present in init.
- Goal: (next object_9 object_5) — present in init.
- Goal: (next object_10 object_6) — present in init.
- Goal: (next object_10 object_8) — present in init.
- Goal: (next object_11 object_9) — present in init.
- Goal: (next object_11 object_6) — present in init.

Conclusion: The provided PDDL plan is empty and correct — no actions are needed because the initial state already satisfies the global goal.

As initial conditions I have that, cats object_0, collect object_5 object_1, collect object_6 object_1, collect object_7 object_2, collect object_8 object_2, hand object_10, hand object_11, hand object_9, next object_0 object_5, next object_10 object_5, next object_11 object_5, next object_3 object_6, next object_4 object_7, next object_9 object_8, sneeze object_3, sneeze object_4, spring object_5, spring object_7, stupendous object_1, stupendous object_2, texture object_5, texture object_6, texture object_7 and texture object_8.
My goal is to have that next object_10 object_8, next object_11 object_7 and next object_9 object_6.

My plan is as follows:

NATURAL-PLAN sas_plan_1
------------------------------
Plan (stepwise, 1.0 time unit per action, starting at t=0.0). Each step lists the action (namespaced by agent), its parameters, a short plain-English description, the key preconditions used, and the effects produced.

1) t=0.0 → 1.0
Action: planner_A_clip(object_9, object_3, object_5)

5) t=4.0 → 5.0
Action: planner_B_memory(object_0, object_5, object_7)
Description: Agent planner_B applies memory to object_0 to change its next-link from object_5 to object_7 (uses springs at object_5 and object_7).
Preconditions (checked): cats(object_0), spring(object_5), spring(object_7), next(object_0, object_5).
Effects: add next(object_0, object_7). remove next(object_0, object_5).

6) t=5.0 → 6.0
Action: planner_A_paltry(object_11, object_0, object_7)
Description: Agent planner_A uses paltry with hand object_11 and vase(object_11, object_0) and next(object_0, object_7) to create next(object_11, object_7), consuming vase(object_11, object_0).
Preconditions (checked): hand(object_11), cats(object_0), texture(object_7), vase(object_11, object_0), next(object_0, object_7).
Effects: add next(object_11, object_7). remove vase(object_11, object_0).

7) t=6.0 → 7.0
Action: planner_A_paltry(object_10, object_0, object_7)
Description: Agent planner_A uses paltry with hand object_10 and vase(object_10, object_0) and next(object_0, object_7) to create next(object_10, object_7), consuming vase(object_10, object_0).
Preconditions (checked): hand(object_10), cats(object_0), texture(object_7), vase(object_10, object_0), next(object_0, object_7).
Effects: add next(object_10, object_7). remove vase(object_10, object_0).

8) t=7.0 → 8.0
Action: planner_B_wretched(object_4, object_7, object_8, object_2)
Description: Agent planner_B applies wretched at sneeze-source object_4 to move the next-link from (object_4→object_7) to (object_4→object_8), using textures at object_7 and object_8 and collect relations into stupendous object_2.
Preconditions (checked): sneeze(object_4), texture(object_7), texture(object_8), stupendous(object_2), next(object_4, object_7), collect(object_7, object_2), collect(object_8, object_2).
Effects: add next(object_4, object_8). remove next(object_4, object_7).

9) t=8.0 → 9.0
Action: planner_A_clip(object_9, object_4, object_8)
Description: Agent planner_A clips object_9 with sneeze-source object_4 at texture object_8, creating vase(object_9, object_4) and removing next(object_9, object_8).
Preconditions (checked): hand(object_9), sneeze(object_4), texture(object_8), next(object_4, object_8), next(object_9, object_8).
Effects: add vase(object_9, object_4). remove next(object_9, object_8).

10) t=9.0 → 10.0
Action: planner_B_wretched(object_4, object_8, object_7, object_2)
Description: Agent planner_B applies wretched again at object_4 to move next from (object_4→object_8) back to (object_4→object_7), using textures at object_8 and object_7 and the same stupendous object_2 and collect relations.
Preconditions (checked): sneeze(object_4), texture(object_8), texture(object_7), stupendous(object_2), next(object_4, object_8), collect(object_8, object_2), collect(object_7, object_2).
Effects: add next(object_4, object_7). remove next(object_4, object_8).

11) t=10.0 → 11.0
Action: planner_B_tightfisted(object_9, object_4, object_7)
Description: Agent planner_B uses tightfisted with hand object_9 and vase(object_9, object_4) and next(object_4, object_7) to create next(object_9, object_7) and consume vase(object_9, object_4).
Preconditions (checked): hand(object_9), sneeze(object_4), texture(object_7), next(object_4, object_7), vase(object_9, object_4).
Effects: add next(object_9, object_7). remove vase(object_9, object_4).

Final state relevant to the goal (after t=11.0):
- next(object_10, object_7) — created at step 7
- next(object_11, object_7) — created at step 6
- next(object_9, object_7)  — created at step 11
- next(object_10, object_8) — present from initial state (never removed)
- next(object_9, object_6)  — created at step 2

All goal next-relations are achieved at the end of the sequence.

FINAL-PLAN
------------------------------
; Resolution note: I assumed two agents (actor, observer). The actor initially holds cup1 (full), clip1 (attachable to doc1), and memo1; the observer holds coin1 and is tightfisted (refuses transfers). Two time slots exist (slotA earlier than slotB); paltry must reserve the earliest free slot (slotA) before slotB. Preferences about refusing/giving and earliest-slot are enforced as hard constraints by initial facts and preconditions. All six action schemas requested are included.

PROBLEM
------------------------------
I am playing with a set of objects. Here are the actions I can do

Paltry object_0 object_1 object_2.
Sip object_0 object_1 object_2.
Clip object_0 object_1 object_2.
Wretched object_0 object_1 object_2 object_3.
Memory object_0 object_1 object_2.
Tightfisted object_0 object_1 object_2.

I have the following restrictions on my actions:
To perform paltry action, the following facts need to be true: hand object_0, cats object_1, texture object_2, vase object_0 object_1, and next object_1 object_2

Normalization notes:
- Predicates were named to be explicit: agent-free, room-free, allowed, associated, assigned, scheduled, completed, produced.
- The natural-language temporal preferences ("earliest", "avoid unavailable slot") were encoded as hard constraints via the allowed predicate and explicit agent-free / room-free facts. This enforces earliest/availability choices as strict constraints.
- To represent the requirement that the report needs both prepare and review completed before producing, a dedicated action produce-report requires two completed tasks (two task parameters) rather than inventing quantifiers or temporal fluents.
- Action parameter ordering is consistent across domain and problem: (agent, task, room, timeslot) where applicable.

NATURAL-PLAN sas_plan_0
------------------------------
1) Step 1 — Assign task
   - Action: assign-task object_1 → object_5 in object_6 at object_10
   - Human-readable: Assign Bob (object_1) to the task "write_summary" (object_5) in room1 (object_6) at timeslot t3 (object_10).
   - Timeslot: t3
   - Preconditions checked: Bob is available at t3, room1 is free at t3, "write_summary" is allowed at t3 — all satisfied.
   - Immediate effects (state updates): 
     - assigned(write_summary, Bob)
     - scheduled(write_summary, t3)
     - agent-free(Bob, t3) is removed
     - room-free(room1, t3) is removed

2) Step 2 — Complete task
   - Action: complete-task object_1 → object_5 at object_10
   - Human-readable: Bob completes the "write_summary" task (object_5) at timeslot t3 (object_10).
   - Timeslot: t3
   - Preconditions checked: write_summary is assigned to Bob and scheduled at t3 — satisfied.
   - Immediate effects:
     - completed(write_summary)

3) Step 3 — Produce deliverable (agenda)
   - Action: produce-agenda object_1 → object_12 for object_5
   - Human-readable: Bob (object_1) produces the "agenda" (object_12), based on the completed "write_summary" (object_5).
   - Timeslot: occurs immediately after completion of write_summary (effectively at/after t3)
   - Preconditions checked: Bob exists, agenda exists, write_summary is completed, and write_summary is associated with agenda — all satisfied.
   - Immediate effects:
     - produced(Bob, agenda)

4) Step 4 — Assign task
   - Action: assign-task object_0 → object_3 in object_7 at object_9
   - Human-readable: Assign Alice (object_0) to the task "prepare_report" (object_3) in room2 (object_7) at timeslot t2 (object_9).
   - Timeslot: t2
   - Preconditions checked: Alice is available at t2, room2 is free at t2, "prepare_report" is allowed at t2 — all satisfied.
   - Immediate effects:
     - assigned(prepare_report, Alice)
     - scheduled(prepare_report, t2)
     - agent-free(Alice, t2) is removed
     - room-free(room2, t2) is removed

5) Step 5 — Complete task
   - Action: complete-task object_0 → object_3 at object_9
   - Human-readable: Alice completes the "prepare_report" task (object_3) at timeslot t2 (object_9).
   - Timeslot: t2
   - Preconditions checked: prepare_report is assigned to Alice and scheduled at t2 — satisfied.
   - Immediate effects:
     - completed(prepare_report)

6) Step 6 — Produce deliverable (report)
   - Action: produce-agenda object_1 → object_11 for object_3
   - Human-readable: Bob (object_1) produces the "report" (object_11) based on the completed "prepare_report" (object_3).
   - Timeslot: occurs immediately after completion of prepare_report (effectively at/after t2)
   - Preconditions checked: Bob exists, report exists, prepare_report is completed, and prepare_report is associated with report — all satisfied.
   - Immediate effects:
     - produced(Bob, report)

Final outcome / goal achievement:
- After these six steps Bob (object_1) has produced both deliverables:
  - produced(object_1, object_12) — the agenda
  - produced(object_1, object_11) — the report
- These satisfy the stated goal (Bob is the producer of both the report and the agenda).
- Total plan cost (as given): 6 (unit cost).

FINAL-PLAN
------------------------------
I don’t have the analyzer summaries (analysis_a and analysis_b) or the descriptive inputs needed to build the concrete PDDL files. I can’t invent availability, objects, or constraints beyond what those summaries contain, and you instructed that natural-language preferences be treated as hard constraints.

Please provide the two structured summaries (analysis_a and analysis_b) or the equivalent details. To produce a correct FastDownward-compatible domain and problem, I need the following from those summaries:

1. Domain name (or a suggested name).
2. A list of agents (if multi-agent) and object types (e.g., robot, room, slot, item).
3. The six action schema summaries:
   - For each action: name, parameters (typed), preconditions (positive/negative ground predicates or formulae over parameters), and effects (add and delete lists).
   - Any temporal or ordering constraints that must be encoded as hard constraints (e.g., “action A must happen before B” or “slot S is unavailable at time T”).
4. Initial state facts:
   - All ground predicates that are true initially (e.g., (at agent1 roomA), (free slot1), resource levels).
   - Any facts that must be false initially.
5. Goal conditions:
   - The set of predicates that must hold in the goal state.
6. Any hard constraints derived from preferences (e.g., earliest time for an event, forbidden assignments, exclusivity).
7. If there are objects or slots that are explicitly unavailable, give their names so they are not marked free.

If you prefer, paste the full analysis_a and analysis_b summaries and I will generate:
- A PDDL domain enclosed in <domain></domain> implementing the six actions with declared preconditions and effects, types, predicates and requirements suitable for FastDownward.
- A PDDL problem enclosed in <problem></problem> listing objects, the initial state, and goal.

If helpful, I can also provide a template showing how the six actions will be encoded so you can confirm before I generate the final files. Which would you prefer?

NATURAL-PLAN sas_plan_5
------------------------------
Below is a step-by-step, human-readable trace of the provided PDDL plan. Each step matches exactly one action from the plan. I give a simple timestamp (1 time unit per step), a short plain-language description, the instantiated preconditions and effects (adds / deletes) according to the domain, and whether the preconditions are met in the predecessor state.

Step 1 (t = 0.0 → 1.0)
- Action: clip object_10 object_4 object_8
- Meaning: Use hand object_10 with sneeze object_4 and texture object_8 to form a vase(object_10,object_4) and remove the relation next(object_10,object_8).
- Preconditions: (hand object_10), (sneeze object_4), (texture object_8), (next object_4 object_8), (next object_10 object_8)
- Effects added: (vase object_10 object_4)
- Effects deleted: (not (next object_10 object_8))
- Preconditions satisfied: Yes

Step 2 (t = 1.0 → 2.0)
- Action: wretched object_4 object_8 object_7 object_2
- Meaning: Because sneeze object_4 and textures and collect relations hold, change next(object_4,object_8) into next(object_4,object_7).
- Preconditions: (sneeze object_4), (texture object_8), (texture object_7), (stupendous object_2), (next object_4 object_8), (collect object_8 object_2), (collect object_7 object_2)
- Effects added: (next object_4 object_7)
- Effects deleted: (not (next object_4 object_8))
- Preconditions satisfied: Yes

Step 3 (t = 2.0 → 3.0)
- Action: tightfisted object_10 object_4 object_7
- Meaning: Using hand object_10, sneeze object_4, texture object_7 and an existing vase(object_10,object_4) produce next(object_10,object_7) and remove vase(object_10,object_4).
- Preconditions: (hand object_10), (sneeze object_4), (texture object_7), (next object_4 object_7), (vase object_10 object_4)
- Effects added: (next object_10 object_7)
- Effects deleted: (not (vase object_10 object_4))
- Preconditions satisfied: Yes

Step 4 (t = 3.0 → 4.0)
- Action: sip object_9 object_0 object_7
- Meaning: With hand object_9, cats object_0, texture object_7 and next(object_9,object_7) & next(object_0,object_7), form vase(object_9,object_0) and remove next(object_9,object_7).
- Preconditions: (hand object_9), (cats object_0), (texture object_7), (next object_9 object_7), (next object_0 object_7)
- Effects added: (vase object_9 object_0)
- Effects deleted: (not (next object_9 object_7))
- Preconditions satisfied: Yes

Step 5 (t = 4.0 → 5.0)
- Action: sip object_10 object_0 object_7
- Meaning: With hand object_10, cats object_0, texture object_7 and next(object_10,object_7) & next(object_0,object_7), form vase(object_10,object_0) and remove next(object_10,object_7).
- Preconditions: (hand object_10), (cats object_0), (texture object_7), (next object_10 object_7), (next object_0 object_7)
- Effects added: (vase object_10 object_0)
- Effects deleted: (not (next object_10 object_7))
- Preconditions satisfied: Yes

Step 6 (t = 5.0 → 6.0)
- Action: memory object_0 object_7 object_5
- Meaning: Using cats object_0 and springs object_7 and object_5, change next(object_0,object_7) into next(object_0,object_5).
- Preconditions: (cats object_0), (spring object_7), (spring object_5), (next object_0 object_7)
- Effects added: (next object_0 object_5)
- Effects deleted: (not (next object_0 object_7))
- Preconditions satisfied: Yes

Step 7 (t = 6.0 → 7.0)
- Action: paltry object_9 object_0 object_5
- Meaning: With hand object_9, cats object_0, texture object_5, vase(object_9,object_0) and next(object_0,object_5), produce next(object_9,object_5) and remove the vase(object_9,object_0).
- Preconditions: (hand object_9), (cats object_0), (texture object_5), (vase object_9 object_0), (next object_0 object_5)
- Effects added: (next object_9 object_5)
- Effects deleted: (not (vase object_9 object_0))
- Preconditions satisfied: Yes

Step 8 (t = 7.0 → 8.0)
- Action: clip object_9 object_3 object_5
- Meaning: With hand object_9, sneeze object_3, texture object_5 and next(object_3,object_5) & next(object_9,object_5), form vase(object_9,object_3) and remove next(object_9,object_5).
- Preconditions: (hand object_9), (sneeze object_3), (texture object_5), (next object_3 object_5), (next object_9 object_5)
- Effects added: (vase object_9 object_3)
- Effects deleted: (not (next object_9 object_5))
- Preconditions satisfied: Yes

Step 9 (t = 8.0 → 9.0)
- Action: sip object_11 object_0 object_5
- Meaning: With hand object_11, cats object_0, texture object_5 and next(object_11,object_5) & next(object_0,object_5), form vase(object_11,object_0) and remove next(object_11,object_5).
- Preconditions: (hand object_11), (cats object_0), (texture object_5), (next object_11 object_5), (next object_0 object_5)
- Effects added: (vase object_11 object_0)
- Effects deleted: (not (next object_11 object_5))
- Preconditions satisfied: Yes

Step 10 (t = 9.0 → 10.0)
- Action: paltry object_10 object_0 object_5
- Meaning: With hand object_10, cats object_0, texture object_5, vase(object_10,object_0) and next(object_0,object_5), produce next(object_10,object_5) and remove vase(object_10,object_0).
- Preconditions: (hand object_10), (cats object_0), (texture object_5), (vase object_10 object_0), (next object_0 object_5)

Final check (after t = 21.0)
- The goal predicates are present:
  - (next object_10 object_6) ← created at Step 15
  - (next object_11 object_7) ← created at Step 21
  - (next object_12 object_7) ← created at Step 20
  - (next object_9 object_6) ← created at Step 13
- All plan steps were applicable in sequence (preconditions were satisfied at each step) and the final goal is achieved.

If you want, I can produce the same sequence in a compact table, or emit only the concise action list with timestamps (no preconditions/effects), or explain any individual step in more depth.

NATURAL-PLAN sas_plan_1
------------------------------
Plan summary (8 steps, unit cost per action => total cost = 8)

Step 1 — t = 0.0s → 1.0s
Action: Clip(object_9, object_3, object_5)
- Informal: Apply Clip to object_9 with reference object_3 to set its successor to object_5.
- Preconditions satisfied at execution: collect(object_9, object_3), stupendous(object_3), texture(object_9).
- Effect (added): next(object_9, object_5).

Step 2 — t = 1.0s → 2.0s
Action: Memory(object_10, object_1, object_6)
- Informal: Store/establish object_6 as a successor of object_10 using object_1 as reference.
- Preconditions satisfied at execution: stupendous(object_1), texture(object_6).
- Effect (added): next(object_10, object_6).

Step 3 — t = 2.0s → 3.0s
Action: Memory(object_10, object_1, object_8)
- Informal: Store/establish object_8 as a successor of object_10 using object_1 as reference.
- Preconditions satisfied at execution: stupendous(object_1), texture(object_8).
- Effect (added): next(object_10, object_8).

Step 4 — t = 3.0s → 4.0s
Action: Memory(object_11, object_1, object_6)
- Informal: Store/establish object_6 as a successor of object_11 using object_1 as reference.
- Preconditions satisfied at execution: stupendous(object_1), texture(object_6).
- Effect (added): next(object_11, object_6).

Step 5 — t = 4.0s → 5.0s
Action: Memory(object_11, object_1, object_9)
- Informal: Store/establish object_9 as a successor of object_11 using object_1 as reference.
- Preconditions satisfied at execution: stupendous(object_1), texture(object_9).
- Effect (added): next(object_11, object_9).

Step 6 — t = 5.0s → 6.0s
Action: Memory(object_12, object_1, object_7)
- Informal: Store/establish object_7 as a successor of object_12 using object_1 as reference.
- Preconditions satisfied at execution: stupendous(object_1), texture(object_7).
- Effect (added): next(object_12, object_7).

Step 7 — t = 6.0s → 7.0s
Action: Memory(object_12, object_1, object_8)
- Informal: Store/establish object_8 as a successor of object_12 using object_1 as reference.
- Preconditions satisfied at execution: stupendous(object_1), texture(object_8).
- Effect (added): next(object_12, object_8).

Step 8 — t = 7.0s → 8.0s
Action: Memory(object_13, object_1, object_9)
- Informal: Store/establish object_9 as a successor of object_13 using object_1 as reference.
- Preconditions satisfied at execution: stupendous(object_1), texture(object_9).
- Effect (added): next(object_13, object_9).

Final state contribution (facts added by this plan):
- next(object_9, object_5)
- next(object_10, object_6)
- next(object_10, object_8)
- next(object_11, object_6)
- next(object_11, object_9)
- next(object_12, object_7)
- next(object_12, object_8)
- next(object_13, object_9)

Goal check: After executing the above 8 actions the required goal facts are achieved:
- next object_10 object_8 — achieved at Step 3
- next object_11 object_6 — achieved at Step 4
- next object_12 object_8 — achieved at Step 7
- next object_9 object_5  — achieved at Step 1
- next object_10 object_6 — achieved at Step 2
