Below is a clear, stepwise human-readable execution of the given plan. Steps follow the plan exactly and report (1) a timestamp, (2) the action with its concrete arguments, (3) which preconditions were true immediately before the action, and (4) the direct effects (which predicates become true and which become false). Times are illustrative sequential timestamps (10 s between steps).

Step 1 — t = 00:00
Action: wretched object_3 object_7 object_6 object_1
Preconditions satisfied before execution:

- Added: next(object_3, object_6)
- Removed: next(object_3, object_7)

Step 2 — t = 00:10

Step 5 — t = 00:40
Action: memory object_0 object_8 object_5
Preconditions satisfied before execution:
- cats(object_0)
- spring(object_8)
- spring(object_5)
- next(object_0, object_8)  (initial)
Effects:
- Added: next(object_0, object_5)
- Removed: next(object_0, object_8)

Step 6 — t = 00:50
Action: sip object_11 object_0 object_5
Preconditions satisfied before execution:
- hand(object_11)
- cats(object_0)
- texture(object_5)
- next(object_11, object_5)   (created by Step 4)
- next(object_0, object_5)    (created by Step 5)
Effects:
- Added: vase(object_11, object_0)
- Removed: next(object_11, object_5)

Step 7 — t = 01:00
Action: memory object_0 object_5 object_8
Preconditions satisfied before execution:
- cats(object_0)
- spring(object_5)
- spring(object_8)
- next(object_0, object_5)   (created by Step 5; present before this action)
Effects:
- Added: next(object_0, object_8)
- Removed: next(object_0, object_5)

Step 8 — t = 01:10
Action: paltry object_11 object_0 object_8
Preconditions satisfied before execution:
- hand(object_11)
- cats(object_0)
- texture(object_8)
- vase(object_11, object_0)   (created by Step 6)
- next(object_0, object_8)    (created by Step 7)
Effects:
- Added: next(object_11, object_8)
- Removed: vase(object_11, object_0)

Step 9 — t = 01:20
Action: clip object_11 object_4 object_8
Preconditions satisfied before execution:
- hand(object_11)
- sneeze(object_4)
- texture(object_8)
- next(object_4, object_8)    (initial)
- next(object_11, object_8)   (created by Step 8)
Effects:
- Added: vase(object_11, object_4)
- Removed: next(object_11, object_8)

Step 10 — t = 01:30
Action: wretched object_4 object_8 object_10 object_2
Preconditions satisfied before execution:
- sneeze(object_4)
- texture(object_8)
- texture(object_10)
- stupendous(object_2)
- next(object_4, object_8)    (initial; still present until this action removes it)
- collect(object_8, object_2)
- collect(object_10, object_2)
Effects:
- Added: next(object_4, object_10)
- Removed: next(object_4, object_8)

Step 11 — t = 01:40
Action: tightfisted object_11 object_4 object_10
Preconditions satisfied before execution:
- hand(object_11)
- sneeze(object_4)
- texture(object_10)
- next(object_4, object_10)   (created by Step 10)
- vase(object_11, object_4)    (created by Step 9)
Effects:
- Added: next(object_11, object_10)
- Removed: vase(object_11, object_4)

Final outcome (after Step 11)
- The goal predicate next(object_11, object_10) is true.
- The plan succeeded in achieving the specified goal.

Notes:
- All actions in the provided plan were applicable at the time they were executed; each step's preconditions were satisfied by initial facts or by effects of earlier steps.
- Timestamps are illustrative and sequential (10 s increments) to show order and durations; they do not come from the PDDL model but are included per the instruction to report times when possible.
