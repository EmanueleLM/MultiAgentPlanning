Sequence of human-readable actions (mapped exactly from the given plan).
Timing: each action is given a 1.0 time-unit duration; timestamps show start times (t = 0.0, 1.0, ...). For each step I list the action, the parameter mapping, the key preconditions that enable it at that time, and the direct effects (facts added and facts removed).

Outcome (after step 13):
- (next object_9 object_7) — created at step 8
- (next object_11 object_7) — created at step 9
- (next object_10 object_7) — created at step 13

These three facts satisfy the declared goal (next object_10 object_7, next object_11 object_7, next object_9 object_7).
