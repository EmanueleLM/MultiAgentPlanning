Result / Goal achievement (after step 15, t = 15)
- The plan's last three effects add:
  - (next object_12 object_7) from Step 13,
  - (next object_11 object_7) from Step 14,
  - (next object_10 object_7) from Step 15.
- These three atoms match the required goal: (next object_10 object_7), (next object_11 object_7), (next object_12 object_7).

Notes
- Each step above follows exactly the grounded actions in the provided plan in the same order; no steps were added or removed.
- Timestamps assume a simple schedule of one action per time unit (t = 0 through t = 14). Each action is listed with its formal preconditions and effects so you can trace the fact changes that achieve the final goal.
