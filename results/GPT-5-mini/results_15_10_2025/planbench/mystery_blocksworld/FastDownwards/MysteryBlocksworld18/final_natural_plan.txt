Below is a human-readable, step-by-step rendering of the given PDDL plan. Each step matches one plan action exactly (no steps added or removed). For each step I list: a timestamp (1.0 time unit per step), the action with its arguments, the action schema preconditions (drawn from the domain) and whether they are satisfied immediately before the step, and the effects (facts added and facts removed). At the end I summarize which plan step achieves each goal.

Assumption for timestamps: actions are instantaneous and executed sequentially at integer timestamps (step 1 at t=0.0s, step 2 at t=1.0s, ..., step 10 at t=9.0s). Total plan length = 10 actions (cost = 10).

Initial facts used are the union given in the problem file.

Step 1 — t = 0.0s
Action: clip object_10 object_4 object_7
- Schema (clip ?h ?s ?t) preconditions: (hand ?h), (sneeze ?s), (texture ?t), (next ?s ?t), (next ?h ?t)
- Preconditions checked before step:
  - hand object_10 — PRESENT
  - sneeze object_4 — PRESENT
  - texture object_7 — PRESENT
  - next object_4 object_7 — PRESENT
  - next object_10 object_7 — PRESENT
  (All preconditions satisfied.)
- Effects:
  - Add: (vase object_10 object_4)
  - Delete: (next object_10 object_7)
- State change summary: object_10 loses next->object_7 and gains vase with object_4.

Step 2 — t = 1.0s
Action: clip object_12 object_4 object_8
- Preconditions:
  - hand object_12 — PRESENT
  - sneeze object_4 — PRESENT
  - texture object_8 — PRESENT
  - next object_4 object_8 — PRESENT
  - next object_12 object_8 — PRESENT
  (All satisfied.)
- Effects:
  - Add: (vase object_12 object_4)
  - Delete: (next object_12 object_8)
- State change: object_12 loses next->object_8 and gains vase with object_4.

Step 3 — t = 2.0s
Action: tightfisted object_12 object_4 object_7
- Schema (tightfisted ?h ?s ?t) preconditions: (hand ?h), (sneeze ?s), (texture ?t), (next ?s ?t), (vase ?h ?s)
- Preconditions checked:
  - hand object_12 — PRESENT
  - sneeze object_4 — PRESENT
  - texture object_7 — PRESENT
  - next object_4 object_7 — PRESENT
  - vase object_12 object_4 — PRESENT (created in Step 2)
  (All satisfied.)
- Effects:
  - Add: (next object_12 object_7)
  - Delete: (vase object_12 object_4)
- State change: object_12 gains next->object_7; vase(object_12,object_4) is removed.

Step 4 — t = 3.0s
Action: wretched object_4 object_7 object_6 object_1
- Schema (wretched ?s ?t1 ?t2 ?st) preconditions:
    (sneeze ?s), (texture ?t1), (texture ?t2), (stupendous ?st), (next ?s ?t1), (collect ?t1 ?st), (collect ?t2 ?st)
- Preconditions checked:
  - sneeze object_4 — PRESENT
  - texture object_7 — PRESENT
  - texture object_6 — PRESENT
  - stupendous object_1 — PRESENT
  - next object_4 object_7 — PRESENT
  - collect object_7 object_1 — PRESENT
  - collect object_6 object_1 — PRESENT
  (All satisfied.)
- Effects:
  - Add: (next object_4 object_6)
  - Delete: (next object_4 object_7)
- State change: object_4's next pointer moves from object_7 to object_6.

Step 5 — t = 4.0s
Action: clip object_11 object_4 object_6
- Preconditions:
  - hand object_11 — PRESENT
  - sneeze object_4 — PRESENT
  - texture object_6 — PRESENT
  - next object_4 object_6 — PRESENT (created in Step 4)
  - next object_11 object_6 — PRESENT (from initial facts)
  (All satisfied.)
- Effects:
  - Add: (vase object_11 object_4)
  - Delete: (next object_11 object_6)
- State change: object_11 loses next->object_6 and gains vase with object_4.

Step 6 — t = 5.0s
Action: tightfisted object_10 object_4 object_6
- Preconditions:
  - hand object_10 — PRESENT
  - sneeze object_4 — PRESENT
  - texture object_6 — PRESENT
  - next object_4 object_6 — PRESENT (from Step 4)
  - vase object_10 object_4 — PRESENT (created in Step 1)
  (All satisfied.)
- Effects:
  - Add: (next object_10 object_6)
  - Delete: (vase object_10 object_4)
- State change: object_10 now has next->object_6 (this satisfies one goal). vase(object_10,object_4) is removed.

Step 7 — t = 6.0s
Action: clip object_11 object_5 object_9
- Preconditions:
  - hand object_11 — PRESENT
  - sneeze object_5 — PRESENT
  - texture object_9 — PRESENT
  - next object_5 object_9 — PRESENT (initial)
  - next object_11 object_9 — PRESENT (initial)
  (All satisfied.)
- Effects:
  - Add: (vase object_11 object_5)
  - Delete: (next object_11 object_9)
- State change: object_11 loses next->object_9 and gets vase with object_5.

Step 8 — t = 7.0s
Action: wretched object_5 object_9 object_10 object_2
- Preconditions:
  - sneeze object_5 — PRESENT
  - texture object_9 — PRESENT
  - texture object_10 — PRESENT
  - stupendous object_2 — PRESENT
  - next object_5 object_9 — PRESENT (was not deleted in Step 7; Step 7 deleted next object_11 object_9)

  - collect object_10 object_2 — PRESENT
  (All satisfied.)
- Effects:
  - Add: (next object_5 object_10)
  - Delete: (next object_5 object_9)
- State change: object_5's next moves from object_9 to object_10.

Step 9 — t = 8.0s
Action: tightfisted object_11 object_5 object_10
- Preconditions:
  - hand object_11 — PRESENT
  - sneeze object_5 — PRESENT
  - texture object_10 — PRESENT
  - next object_5 object_10 — PRESENT (created in Step 8)
  - vase object_11 object_5 — PRESENT (created in Step 7)
  (All satisfied.)
- Effects:
  - Add: (next object_11 object_10)
  - Delete: (vase object_11 object_5)
- State change: object_11 now has next->object_10 (this satisfies the analyst_B goal next object_11 object_10). vase(object_11,object_5) removed.

Step 10 — t = 9.0s
Action: tightfisted object_11 object_4 object_8
- Preconditions:
  - hand object_11 — PRESENT
  - sneeze object_4 — PRESENT
  - texture object_8 — PRESENT
  - next object_4 object_8 — PRESENT (from initial and unchanged until now)
  - vase object_11 object_4 — PRESENT (created in Step 5 and not yet removed)
  (All satisfied.)
- Effects:
  - Add: (next object_11 object_8)
  - Delete: (vase object_11 object_4)
- State change: object_11 now has next->object_8. vase(object_11,object_4) removed.

Final check — Goals and which steps accomplished them
- Goal (next object_10 object_6): achieved by Step 6.
- Goal (next object_11 object_8): achieved by Step 10.
- Goal (next object_12 object_7): achieved by Step 3.
- Goal (next object_13 object_9): was already true in the initial state and was not altered by the plan.
- Goal (next object_11 object_10): achieved by Step 9.

All required goal atoms are true after Step 10.

Notes / short commentary
- Every action in the plan was applicable when executed (each action’s preconditions were present in the state immediately prior to that step).
- The plan uses creation/removal of (vase ...) and (next ...) facts in a coordinated way: clip/sip produce (vase ...) while removing a (next ...); tightfisted and paltry/memory/wretched move a (next ...) relation while deleting or requiring a vase.
- Total steps: 10, executed sequentially; total cost reported in plan = 10.

If you would like these same steps translated into a compact checklist (no precondition/effect details) or into a timeline with absolute times, I can provide that too.
