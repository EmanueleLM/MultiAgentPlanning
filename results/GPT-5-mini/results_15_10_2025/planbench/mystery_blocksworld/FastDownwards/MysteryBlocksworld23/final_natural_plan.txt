Plan (10 steps). I list each step with a simple timestamp (start = t=0.0, each action duration = 1.0 time unit), the exact action from the plan, a short human-readable description, the preconditions used at that moment, and the effects (what relational facts are added and removed). This follows the provided plan exactly and shows how the required goal facts are achieved.

t = 0.0 — Step 1 (duration 1.0)
Action: a_clip object_13 object_3 object_7
Natural-language: Observer_A’s clip: using hand object_13 with sneeze object_3 targeting texture object_7.
Preconditions (satisfied at this time): hand(object_13), sneeze(object_3), texture(object_7), next(object_3,object_7), next(object_13,object_7).
Effects: add (vase object_13 object_3); remove (next object_13 object_7).
Discussion: creates a vase link from object_13 to object_3 and removes the existing next(object_13,object_7).

t = 1.0 — Step 2 (duration 1.0)
Action: a_wretched object_3 object_7 object_6 object_1
Natural-language: Observer_A’s wretched: from sneeze object_3 move its next from texture object_7 to texture object_6 (uses stupendous object_1 and collect links).
Preconditions: sneeze(object_3), texture(object_7), texture(object_6), stupendous(object_1), next(object_3,object_7), collect(object_7,object_1), collect(object_6,object_1).
Effects: add (next object_3 object_6); remove (next object_3 object_7).
Discussion: object_3’s next target becomes object_6 instead of object_7.

t = 2.0 — Step 3 (duration 1.0)
Action: a_clip object_11 object_3 object_6
Natural-language: Observer_A’s clip: using hand object_11 with sneeze object_3 targeting texture object_6.
Preconditions: hand(object_11), sneeze(object_3), texture(object_6), next(object_3,object_6), next(object_11,object_6).
Effects: add (vase object_11 object_3); remove (next object_11 object_6).
Discussion: creates a vase linking object_11→object_3 and removes object_11’s previous next to object_6.

t = 3.0 — Step 4 (duration 1.0)
Action: a_wretched object_3 object_6 object_7 object_1
Natural-language: Observer_A’s wretched: from sneeze object_3 move its next back from texture object_6 to texture object_7 (again using stupendous object_1 and collect links).
Preconditions: sneeze(object_3), texture(object_6), texture(object_7), stupendous(object_1), next(object_3,object_6), collect(object_6,object_1), collect(object_7,object_1).
Effects: add (next object_3 object_7); remove (next object_3 object_6).
Discussion: object_3’s next target is restored to object_7 (this sequence enabled later vase→next transfers).

t = 4.0 — Step 5 (duration 1.0)
Action: a_tightfisted object_11 object_3 object_7
Natural-language: Observer_A’s tightfisted: use hand object_11 together with vase(object_11,object_3) and next(object_3,object_7) to set next(object_11,object_7).
Preconditions: hand(object_11), sneeze(object_3), texture(object_7), next(object_3,object_7), vase(object_11,object_3).
Effects: add (next object_11 object_7); remove (vase object_11 object_3).
Result: next(object_11,object_7) is now true — one of the required goal facts.

t = 5.0 — Step 6 (duration 1.0)
Action: a_wretched object_3 object_7 object_9 object_2
Natural-language: Observer_A’s wretched: from sneeze object_3 move its next from texture object_7 to texture object_9 (uses stupendous object_2 and appropriate collect links).
Preconditions: sneeze(object_3), texture(object_7), texture(object_9), stupendous(object_2), next(object_3,object_7), collect(object_7,object_2), collect(object_9,object_2).
Effects: add (next object_3 object_9); remove (next object_3 object_7).
Discussion: object_3 now points to texture object_9, enabling the next step for object_13.

t = 6.0 — Step 7 (duration 1.0)
Action: a_tightfisted object_13 object_3 object_9
Natural-language: Observer_A’s tightfisted: use hand object_13 together with vase(object_13,object_3) and next(object_3,object_9) to set next(object_13,object_9).
Preconditions: hand(object_13), sneeze(object_3), texture(object_9), next(object_3,object_9), vase(object_13,object_3).
Effects: add (next object_13 object_9); remove (vase object_13 object_3).
Result: next(object_13,object_9) is now true — another required goal fact.

t = 7.0 — Step 8 (duration 1.0)
Action: a_wretched object_4 object_10 object_11 object_3
Natural-language: Observer_A’s wretched: from sneeze object_4 move its next from texture object_10 to texture object_11 (uses stupendous object_3 and collect links).
Preconditions: sneeze(object_4), texture(object_10), texture(object_11), stupendous(object_3), next(object_4,object_10), collect(object_10,object_3), collect(object_11,object_3).
Effects: add (next object_4 object_11); remove (next object_4 object_10).
Discussion: sets up object_4’s next to object_11, which is used next to create a vase for object_12.

t = 8.0 — Step 9 (duration 1.0)
Action: a_clip object_12 object_4 object_11
Natural-language: Observer_A’s clip: using hand object_12 with sneeze object_4 targeting texture object_11.
Preconditions: hand(object_12), sneeze(object_4), texture(object_11), next(object_4,object_11), next(object_12,object_11).
Effects: add (vase object_12 object_4); remove (next object_12 object_11).
Discussion: creates vase(object_12,object_4) and removes object_12’s next to object_11 (object_12 still has its original next to object_10 untouched).

t = 9.0 — Step 10 (duration 1.0)
Action: a_tightfisted object_12 object_4 object_8
Natural-language: Observer_A’s tightfisted: use hand object_12 together with vase(object_12,object_4) and next(object_4,object_8) to set next(object_12,object_8).
Preconditions: hand(object_12), sneeze(object_4), texture(object_8), next(object_4,object_8), vase(object_12,object_4).
Effects: add (next object_12 object_8); remove (vase object_12 object_4).
Result: next(object_12,object_8) is now true — another required goal fact.

Final state summary (after t = 10.0)
- Achieved goal facts:
  - next(object_11, object_7) — set at Step 5
  - next(object_12, object_8) — set at Step 10
  - next(object_13, object_9) — set at Step 7
  - next(object_12, object_10) — was already true in the initial state and was never removed during these steps, so it remains true
- All four goal conjuncts in the PDDL problem are satisfied by this sequence.

Plan cost: 10 actions (unit cost per action) — matches the provided plan cost.

Notes on compliance with the specification
- This description follows the exact action sequence from the provided plan; no actions were added or removed.
- Each action is described using the action schema (observer_A prefix a_...) and references the preconditions and effects defined in the domain.
- Timestamps and durations are simple and uniform (1.0 time unit per action) to make the sequence readable and to satisfy the “report time duration / timestamp whenever possible” request.
