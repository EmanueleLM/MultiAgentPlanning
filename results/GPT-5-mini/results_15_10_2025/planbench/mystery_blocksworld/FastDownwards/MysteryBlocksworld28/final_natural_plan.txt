End state (selected relevant facts):
- (next object_12 object_10) — added in Step 11
- (next object_13 object_10) — added in Step 10
- (next object_14 object_9) — was present initially and preserved
- (next object_11 object_9) — added in Step 14
- (next object_12 object_8) — added in Step 6
- (next object_13 object_5) — added in Step 4
- (next object_14 object_7) — added in Step 17
- (vase) facts that were added have been deleted where appropriate by later steps; final vase predicates are not needed for the goal.

Goal verification:
All goal predicates are satisfied in the final state:
- next object_12 object_10 — yes (Step 11)
- next object_13 object_10 — yes (Step 10)
- next object_14 object_9 — yes (initial, preserved)
- next object_11 object_9 — yes (Step 14)
- next object_12 object_8 — yes (Step 6)
- next object_13 object_5 — yes (Step 4)
- next object_14 object_7 — yes (Step 17)

Plan cost and duration:
- Plan length: 17 actions (given cost = 17 unit cost)
- Illustrative elapsed time (with 10s per step): ~02:50 (170 seconds). Actual durations per action are domain-dependent; timestamps provided above are illustrative.

Notes:
- Each step was checked against the action schema preconditions and the running state; all steps were applicable when executed.
- No steps were added or removed from the given plan; the sequence above matches the provided plan exactly.
