Below is a clear, human-readable replay of the provided plan. Each step matches exactly one action from the plan in the given order. I include a simple timestamp (assuming each action takes 1.0s) and state the action’s parameterization, the relevant preconditions checked at that moment, and the concrete add/delete effects (expressed with the original predicate names and object identifiers).

Timeline convention: step start times t=0.0s, t=1.0s, ...; each action duration = 1.0s.

1) t = 0.0s — 1.0s
Action: wretched(object_3, object_7, object_6, object_1)
- Preconditions required at execution:
  - sneeze object_3
  - texture object_7
  - texture object_6
  - stupendous object_1
  - next object_3 object_7
  - collect object_7 object_1
  - collect object_6 object_1
- Effects (applied atomically):
  - Add: next object_3 object_6
  - Delete: next object_3 object_7
- Resulting change: object_3’s "next" pointer moves from object_7 to object_6.

2) t = 1.0s — 2.0s
Action: clip(object_11, object_3, object_6)
- Preconditions required at execution:
  - hand object_11
  - sneeze object_3
  - texture object_6
  - next object_3 object_6
  - next object_11 object_6
- Effects:
  - Add: vase object_11 object_3
  - Delete: next object_11 object_6
- Resulting change: next(object_11, object_6) is removed and a vase relation between object_11 and object_3 is created.

3) t = 2.0s — 3.0s
Action: wretched(object_3, object_6, object_5, object_1)
- Preconditions:
  - sneeze object_3
  - texture object_6
  - texture object_5
  - stupendous object_1
  - next object_3 object_6
  - collect object_6 object_1
  - collect object_5 object_1
- Effects:
  - Add: next object_3 object_5
  - Delete: next object_3 object_6
- Resulting change: object_3’s "next" pointer moves from object_6 to object_5.

4) t = 3.0s — 4.0s
Action: tightfisted(object_11, object_3, object_5)
- Preconditions:
  - hand object_11
  - sneeze object_3
  - texture object_5
  - next object_3 object_5
  - vase object_11 object_3
- Effects:
  - Add: next object_11 object_5
  - Delete: vase object_11 object_3
- Resulting change: vase(object_11, object_3) is removed and next(object_11, object_5) is established.

5) t = 4.0s — 5.0s
Action: memory(object_0, object_8, object_5)
- Preconditions:
  - cats object_0
  - spring object_8
  - spring object_5
  - next object_0 object_8
- Effects:
  - Add: next object_0 object_5
  - Delete: next object_0 object_8
- Resulting change: object_0’s "next" pointer changes from object_8 to object_5.

6) t = 5.0s — 6.0s
Action: sip(object_11, object_0, object_5)
- Preconditions:
  - hand object_11
  - cats object_0
  - texture object_5
  - next object_11 object_5
  - next object_0 object_5
- Effects:
  - Add: vase object_11 object_0
  - Delete: next object_11 object_5
- Resulting change: next(object_11, object_5) removed; vase(object_11, object_0) created.

7) t = 6.0s — 7.0s
Action: memory(object_0, object_5, object_8)
- Preconditions:
  - cats object_0
  - spring object_5
  - spring object_8
  - next object_0 object_5
- Effects:
  - Add: next object_0 object_8
  - Delete: next object_0 object_5
- Resulting change: object_0’s "next" pointer restores from object_5 back to object_8.

8) t = 7.0s — 8.0s
Action: paltry(object_11, object_0, object_8)
- Preconditions:
  - hand object_11
  - cats object_0
  - texture object_8
  - vase object_11 object_0
  - next object_0 object_8
- Effects:
  - Add: next object_11 object_8
  - Delete: vase object_11 object_0
- Resulting change: vase(object_11, object_0) removed; next(object_11, object_8) created.

9) t = 8.0s — 9.0s
Action: clip(object_11, object_4, object_8)
- Preconditions:
  - hand object_11
  - sneeze object_4
  - texture object_8
  - next object_4 object_8
  - next object_11 object_8
- Effects:
  - Add: vase object_11 object_4
  - Delete: next object_11 object_8
- Resulting change: next(object_11, object_8) removed; vase(object_11, object_4) created.

10) t = 9.0s — 10.0s
Action: wretched(object_4, object_8, object_10, object_2)
- Preconditions:
  - sneeze object_4
  - texture object_8
  - texture object_10
  - stupendous object_2
  - next object_4 object_8
  - collect object_8 object_2
  - collect object_10 object_2
- Effects:
  - Add: next object_4 object_10
  - Delete: next object_4 object_8
- Resulting change: object_4’s "next" pointer moves from object_8 to object_10.

11) t = 10.0s — 11.0s
Action: tightfisted(object_11, object_4, object_10)
- Preconditions:
  - hand object_11
  - sneeze object_4
  - texture object_10
  - next object_4 object_10
  - vase object_11 object_4
- Effects:
  - Add: next object_11 object_10
  - Delete: vase object_11 object_4
- Resulting change: vase(object_11, object_4) removed; next(object_11, object_10) created.

Final check (t = 11.0s):
- Goal predicate next object_11 object_10 is now present.
- The plan completed in 11 steps (11.0s total with 1.0s per action) and achieves the required goal next object_11 object_10.

Notes:
- All step descriptions keep the original predicate and object identifiers exactly as given.
- Preconditions listed at each step are those required by the action schema; in the plan these were satisfied at execution time (according to the provided initial state and prior effects).
- No actions were added or deleted; order and parameters match the provided plan exactly.
