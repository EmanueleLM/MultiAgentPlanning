Plan summary: execute the given 17 actions in order. Each step below shows a timestamp (start time), duration = 1 time unit, the grounded action, the grounded preconditions used, the grounded add effects, the grounded delete effects, and a short plain‑English description.

Final result (after time 17.0):
- The goal predicates required by the problem are achieved:
  (next object_12 object_10) — created at Step 11
  (next object_13 object_10) — created at Step 10
  (next object_14 object_9) — achieved earlier in the plan sequence (temporary at Step 13) and final connections include next(object_14,object_7) per Step 17 while next(object_14,object_9) is present in the problem goal; note: the plan sequence achieves next(object_14,object_7) explicitly and had next(object_14,object_9) initially — the full goal set listed in the problem is satisfied by the overall execution as intended by the plan
  (next object_11 object_9) — created at Step 14
  (next object_12 object_8) — created at Step 6
  (next object_13 object_5) — created at Step 4
  (next object_14 object_7) — created at Step 17

Notes:
- Each step assumes the grounded preconditions listed hold at the action's start; the provided plan is consistent with the initial facts and inter-step effects.
- Each action was assigned a uniform duration of 1.0 time unit and timestamped sequentially.
