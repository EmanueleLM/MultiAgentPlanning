1) [t=0s → t=1s] consonant_agent: Pick up block B from the table.
   - Action executed: cons-pickup-from-table B
   - Duration: 1s (unit cost 1)
   - Preconditions satisfied: B is on the table, B is clear, consonant_agent's hand is empty, consonant_agent may manipulate B.
   - Resulting immediate state: consonant_agent is holding B; B is no longer on the table; consonant_agent's hand is not empty.

2) [t=1s → t=2s] consonant_agent: Place block B onto block C.
   - Action executed: cons-putdown-on-block B C
   - Duration: 1s (unit cost 1)
   - Preconditions satisfied: consonant_agent is holding B, C is clear.
   - Resulting immediate state: B is on C; B is clear; C is no longer clear; consonant_agent's hand becomes empty.

3) [t=2s → t=3s] vowel_agent: Pick up block A from the table.
   - Action executed: vowel-pick-from-table A
   - Duration: 1s (unit cost 1)
   - Preconditions satisfied: A is on the table, A is clear, vowel_agent's hand is empty, A is a vowel block.
   - Resulting immediate state: vowel_agent is holding A; A is no longer on the table; vowel_agent's hand is not empty.

4) [t=3s → t=4s] vowel_agent: Place block A onto block B.
   - Action executed: vowel-place-on-block A B
   - Duration: 1s (unit cost 1)
   - Preconditions satisfied: vowel_agent is holding A, B is clear.
   - Resulting immediate state: A is on B; A is clear; B is no longer clear; vowel_agent's hand becomes empty.

5) [t=4s → t=4s+] orchestrator: Announce success (final check & goal marker set).
   - Action executed: orchestrator-announce-success
   - Duration: instantaneous / 0s (unit cost included in total)
   - Preconditions satisfied: the full tower exists (A on B, B on C, C on D, D on E, E on F, F on G, G on H, H on I, I on J), J is on the table, and both agents' hands are empty.
   - Resulting immediate state: goal-reached (orchestrator success marker set).

Final configuration after step 5:
- Single tower: A on B on C on D on E on F on G on H on I on J, with J on the table.
- Both agents' hands are empty.
Total plan cost: 5 (five actions, unit cost each).
