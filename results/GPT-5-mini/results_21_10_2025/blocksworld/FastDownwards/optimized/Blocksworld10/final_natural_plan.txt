Summary: the following is a step-by-step, human-readable trace of the given plan. Each line corresponds exactly to one action in the plan (no actions added or removed). I show the agent, the action, the blocks involved, a one-line description of the effect, and a simple timestamp assuming each action takes 1s. Time 0s–1s is step 1, 1s–2s is step 2, etc. Total actions = 78, total cost = 78 time units.
