Here is a human-readable, step-by-step execution of the provided plan. Each step lists the acting agent, the move performed (source -> destination), and a timestamp assuming each action takes 1.0 time unit (step 1 starts at t=0.0). The sequence is exactly the actions in the plan, in order (33 actions total).

1. t=0.0–1.0 — consonant_agent: Move D from on top of F onto E. (D: F -> E)
2. t=1.0–2.0 — consonant_agent: Move F from on top of I onto D. (F: I -> D)
3. t=2.0–3.0 — consonant_agent: Move H from on top of K onto I. (H: K -> I)
4. t=3.0–4.0 — consonant_agent: Move K from on top of B to the table. (K: B -> table)
5. t=4.0–5.0 — consonant_agent: Move F from on top of D to the table. (F: D -> table)
6. t=5.0–6.0 — consonant_agent: Move D from on top of E onto B. (D: E -> B)
7. t=6.0–7.0 — vowel_agent: Move E from the table onto F. (E: table -> F)
8. t=7.0–8.0 — consonant_agent: Move D from on top of B onto E. (D: B -> E)
9. t=8.0–9.0 — consonant_agent: Move H from on top of I to the table. (H: I -> table)
10. t=9.0–10.0 — vowel_agent: Move I from on top of C onto B. (I: C -> B)
11. t=10.0–11.0 — consonant_agent: Move C from on top of A onto D. (C: A -> D)
12. t=11.0–12.0 — vowel_agent: Move A from on top of J onto C. (A: J -> C)
13. t=12.0–13.0 — consonant_agent: Move J from on top of G onto K. (J: G -> K)
14. t=13.0–14.0 — vowel_agent: Move I from on top of B onto J. (I: B -> J)
15. t=14.0–15.0 — vowel_agent: Move A from on top of C onto B. (A: C -> B)
16. t=15.0–16.0 — consonant_agent: Move H from the table onto I. (H: table -> I)
17. t=16.0–17.0 — consonant_agent: Move G from the table onto H. (G: table -> H)
18. t=17.0–18.0 — vowel_agent: Move A from on top of B to the table. (A: B -> table)
19. t=18.0–19.0 — consonant_agent: Move C from on top of D to the table. (C: D -> table)
20. t=19.0–20.0 — consonant_agent: Move D from on top of E to the table. (D: E -> table)
21. t=20.0–21.0 — consonant_agent: Move C from the table onto D. (C: table -> D)
22. t=21.0–22.0 — consonant_agent: Move B from the table onto C. (B: table -> C)
23. t=22.0–23.0 — vowel_agent: Move A from the table onto B. (A: table -> B)
24. t=23.0–24.0 — vowel_agent: Move E from on top of F onto A. (E: F -> A)
25. t=24.0–25.0 — consonant_agent: Move F from the table onto G. (F: table -> G)
26. t=25.0–26.0 — vowel_agent: Move E from on top of A onto F. (E: A -> F)
27. t=26.0–27.0 — vowel_agent: Move A from on top of B to the table. (A: B -> table)
28. t=27.0–28.0 — consonant_agent: Move B from on top of C to the table. (B: C -> table)
29. t=28.0–29.0 — consonant_agent: Move C from on top of D onto A. (C: D -> A)
30. t=29.0–30.0 — consonant_agent: Move D from the table onto E. (D: table -> E)
31. t=30.0–31.0 — consonant_agent: Move C from on top of A onto D. (C: A -> D)
32. t=31.0–32.0 — consonant_agent: Move B from the table onto C. (B: table -> C)
33. t=32.0–33.0 — vowel_agent: Move A from the table onto B. (A: table -> B)

Final state after step 33 (goal achieved):
- A is on B
- B is on C
- C is on D
- D is on E
- E is on F
- F is on G
- G is on H
- H is on I
- I is on J
- J is on K
- K is on the table

Total plan cost: 33 time units (33 actions).
