Summary: total cost = 2 (each action unit cost). The vowel_agent performs two actions, one after the other.

Step 1 — t = 0.0 → 1.0 (duration 1.0)
Action (PDDL): (vowel_pickup_from_table a)
Human-readable: Vowel agent picks up block A from the table.
Notes/effects:
- Precondition satisfied: A is a vowel block, A is on the table, A is clear, and the vowel agent’s hand is empty.
- Result: A is removed from the table and held by the vowel_agent. (A is no longer on the table and is not clear; vowel agent’s hand is no longer empty.)

Step 2 — t = 1.0 → 2.0 (duration 1.0)
Action (PDDL): (vowel_stack a b)
Human-readable: Vowel agent places block A on top of block B (stacks A onto B).
Notes/effects:
- Precondition satisfied: vowel_agent is holding A and B is clear.
- Result: A is now on B; A is clear; B is no longer clear; vowel agent’s hand becomes empty.

Final state (after step 2):
- on A B
- on B C
- on C D
- on D E
- ontable E

Goal achieved: A on B, B on C, C on D, D on E, E on the table.
