Goal: build a single tower A (top) → B → C → D → E → F → G → H → I → J → K → L → M → N (N on table).

Notes:
- Agents performing actions are kept distinct: vowel actions (vowel-unstack, vowel-stack, vowel-putdown, vowel-pickup-from-table) by the Vowel agent; consonant actions (cons-unstack, cons-stack, cons-putdown, cons-pickup-from-table) by the Consonant agent.
- Timestamps are shown as elapsed seconds assuming 5 seconds per action for readability; they are illustrative durations and follow the step order exactly.
