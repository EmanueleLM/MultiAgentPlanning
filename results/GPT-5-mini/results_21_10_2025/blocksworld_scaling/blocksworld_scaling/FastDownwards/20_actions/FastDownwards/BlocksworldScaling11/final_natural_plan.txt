Below is a step-by-step, human-readable execution of the provided PDDL plan. Each step matches the plan exactly (no actions added or removed). For clarity I include the acting agent, the block moved, source and destination, and a simple timestamp with 1.0 time unit per action.

Summary: 41 actions, time 0.0 → 41.0, cost = 41 (1 unit per action).

1. Time 0.0–1.0 (duration 1.0) — consonant_agent: Move H from C to TABLE.  
2. Time 1.0–2.0 — consonant_agent: Move C from E to TABLE.  
3. Time 2.0–3.0 — vowel_agent: Move E from G to C.  
4. Time 3.0–4.0 — consonant_agent: Move G from L to H.  
5. Time 4.0–5.0 — consonant_agent: Move J from K to E.  
6. Time 5.0–6.0 — consonant_agent: Move K from A to L.  
7. Time 6.0–7.0 — consonant_agent: Move J from E to K.  
8. Time 7.0–8.0 — vowel_agent: Move A from M to E.  
9. Time 8.0–9.0 — consonant_agent: Move M from B to TABLE.  
10. Time 9.0–10.0 — vowel_agent: Move A from E to B.  
11. Time 10.0–11.0 — vowel_agent: Move E from C to TABLE.  
12. Time 11.0–12.0 — vowel_agent: Move A from B to E.  
13. Time 12.0–13.0 — consonant_agent: Move B from D to C.  
14. Time 13.0–14.0 — vowel_agent: Move A from E to B.  
15. Time 14.0–15.0 — consonant_agent: Move D from I to E.  
16. Time 15.0–16.0 — vowel_agent: Move I from F to J.  
17. Time 16.0–17.0 — consonant_agent: Move F from TABLE to G.  
18. Time 17.0–18.0 — consonant_agent: Move D from E to A.  
19. Time 18.0–19.0 — vowel_agent: Move E from TABLE to F.  
20. Time 19.0–20.0 — consonant_agent: Move D from A to E.  
21. Time 20.0–21.0 — vowel_agent: Move I from J to TABLE.  
22. Time 21.0–22.0 — consonant_agent: Move J from K to TABLE.  
23. Time 22.0–23.0 — consonant_agent: Move K from L to A.  
24. Time 23.0–24.0 — consonant_agent: Move L from TABLE to M.  
25. Time 24.0–25.0 — consonant_agent: Move K from A to L.  
26. Time 25.0–26.0 — consonant_agent: Move J from TABLE to K.  
27. Time 26.0–27.0 — vowel_agent: Move I from TABLE to J.  
28. Time 27.0–28.0 — consonant_agent: Move D from E to TABLE.  
29. Time 28.0–29.0 — vowel_agent: Move E from F to TABLE.  
30. Time 29.0–30.0 — consonant_agent: Move F from G to TABLE.  
31. Time 30.0–31.0 — consonant_agent: Move G from H to A.  
32. Time 31.0–32.0 — consonant_agent: Move H from TABLE to I.  
33. Time 32.0–33.0 — consonant_agent: Move G from A to H.  
34. Time 33.0–34.0 — consonant_agent: Move F from TABLE to G.  
35. Time 34.0–35.0 — vowel_agent: Move E from TABLE to F.  
36. Time 35.0–36.0 — consonant_agent: Move D from TABLE to E.  
37. Time 36.0–37.0 — vowel_agent: Move A from B to TABLE.  
38. Time 37.0–38.0 — consonant_agent: Move B from C to A.  
39. Time 38.0–39.0 — consonant_agent: Move C from TABLE to D.  
40. Time 39.0–40.0 — consonant_agent: Move B from A to C.  
41. Time 40.0–41.0 — vowel_agent: Move A from TABLE to B.

Final time: 41.0. Final cost: 41.

Notes and compliance:
- Actions labeled "vowel_agent" are only moves of A, E, I (vowels). Actions labeled "consonant_agent" are only moves of consonants.  
- Every action is a single-block move and (per the plan and domain) implicitly moves only the top block of a stack.  
- The sequence above is identical in order and content to the provided PDDL plan; no actions were added, removed, or reordered.  
- At completion, the goal stacking (A on B, B on C, C on D, D on E, E on F, F on G, G on H, H on I, I on J, J on K, K on L, L on M, M on TABLE) is achieved.
