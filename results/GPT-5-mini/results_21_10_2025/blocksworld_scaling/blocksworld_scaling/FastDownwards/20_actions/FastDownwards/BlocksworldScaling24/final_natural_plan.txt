Below is a human-readable, step-by-step execution of the provided PDDL plan. Each step exactly follows the actions in the given plan, identifies the agent that performs it (vowel_agent or consonant_agent), and gives a timestamp (start time for that step) with an assumed duration of 10 seconds per action.

All block labels are shown in uppercase to match the problem specification.
