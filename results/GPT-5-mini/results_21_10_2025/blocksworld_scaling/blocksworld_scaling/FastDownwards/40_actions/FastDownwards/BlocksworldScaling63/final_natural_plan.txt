Below is a step-by-step, human-readable execution of the given PDDL plan. Each action is labeled with the agent that performs it. I assign a uniform duration of 1.0 time unit per action and show start/end timestamps (you can reinterpret timestamps as arbitrary time units).

Step 1 — t=0.0 → 1.0
- Agent: consonant_agent
- Action: Move J from D to K
- Description: Place block J onto block K.

Step 2 — t=1.0 → 2.0
- Agent: consonant_agent
- Action: Move D from C to E
- Description: Place block D onto block E.

Step 3 — t=2.0 → 3.0
- Agent: consonant_agent
- Action: Move C from L to D
- Description: Place block C onto block D.

Step 4 — t=3.0 → 4.0
- Agent: consonant_agent
- Action: Move B from t3 (table slot t3) to C
- Description: Place block B onto block C.

Step 5 — t=4.0 → 5.0
- Agent: consonant_agent
- Action: Move J from K to B
- Description: Place block J onto block B.

Step 6 — t=5.0 → 6.0
- Agent: consonant_agent
- Action: Move K from I to L
- Description: Place block K onto block L.

Step 7 — t=6.0 → 7.0
- Agent: consonant_agent
- Action: Move J from B to K
- Description: Place block J back onto block K.

Step 8 — t=7.0 → 8.0
- Agent: vowel_agent
- Action: Move I from A to J
- Description: Place vowel block I onto block J.

Step 9 — t=8.0 → 9.0
- Agent: consonant_agent
- Action: Move B from C to t10 (table slot t10)
- Description: Move block B to an empty table slot t10.

Step 10 — t=9.0 → 10.0
- Agent: consonant_agent
- Action: Move C from D to t11 (table slot t11)
- Description: Move block C to an empty table slot t11.

Step 11 — t=10.0 → 11.0
- Agent: consonant_agent
- Action: Move B from t10 to C
- Description: Place block B back onto block C.

Step 12 — t=11.0 → 12.0
- Agent: vowel_agent
- Action: Move A from t2 (table slot t2) to B
- Description: Place vowel block A onto block B.

Step 13 — t=12.0 → 13.0
- Agent: consonant_agent
- Action: Move D from E to A
- Description: Place block D onto block A.

Step 14 — t=13.0 → 14.0
- Agent: vowel_agent
- Action: Move E from H to D
- Description: Place vowel block E onto block D.

Step 15 — t=14.0 → 15.0
- Agent: consonant_agent
- Action: Move H from G to I
- Description: Place block H onto block I.

Step 16 — t=15.0 → 16.0
- Agent: consonant_agent
- Action: Move G from F to H
- Description: Place block G onto block H.

Step 17 — t=16.0 → 17.0
- Agent: consonant_agent
- Action: Move F from t4 (table slot t4) to G
- Description: Place block F onto block G.

Step 18 — t=17.0 → 18.0
- Agent: vowel_agent
- Action: Move E from D to F
- Description: Move vowel block E from D and place it onto block F.

Step 19 — t=18.0 → 19.0
- Agent: consonant_agent
- Action: Move D from A to E
- Description: Place block D onto block E.

Step 20 — t=19.0 → 20.0
- Agent: vowel_agent
- Action: Move A from B to t10 (table slot t10)
- Description: Move vowel block A to temporary table slot t10.

Step 21 — t=20.0 → 21.0
- Agent: consonant_agent
- Action: Move B from C to A
- Description: Place block B onto block A.

Step 22 — t=21.0 → 22.0
- Agent: consonant_agent
- Action: Move C from t11 to D
- Description: Move block C from temporary table slot t11 and place it onto block D.

Step 23 — t=22.0 → 23.0
- Agent: consonant_agent
- Action: Move B from A to C
- Description: Place block B onto block C.

Step 24 — t=23.0 → 24.0
- Agent: vowel_agent
- Action: Move A from t10 to B
- Description: Place vowel block A onto block B.

End state (after Step 24)
- The sequence finishes the intended tower ordering: A on B, B on C, C on D, D on E, E on F, F on G, G on H, H on I, I on J, J on K, K on L, and L on the table (as required).
