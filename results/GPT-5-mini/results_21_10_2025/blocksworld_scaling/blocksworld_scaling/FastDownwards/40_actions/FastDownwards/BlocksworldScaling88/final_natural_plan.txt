Below is a step-by-step, human-readable trace of the plan. Each step lists the agent, the block moved, the source, and the destination. I report a simple timestamp assuming each action takes 1 time unit; step n runs from t=(n-1) to t=n.

19. t=18.0–19.0 — Consonant agent: pick up G from the table and place G on top of H.
20. t=19.0–20.0 — Vowel agent: pick up I from on J and place I on top of G.
21. t=20.0–21.0 — Consonant agent: pick up J from the table and place J on top of K.
22. t=21.0–22.0 — Vowel agent: pick up I from on G and place I on top of J.
23. t=22.0–23.0 — Consonant agent: pick up G from the table and place G on top of H.
24. t=23.0–24.0 — Consonant agent: pick up H from on A and place H on top of I.
25. t=24.0–25.0 — Consonant agent: pick up G from the table and place G on top of H.
26. t=25.0–26.0 — Vowel agent: pick up A from the table and place A on top of B.
27. t=26.0–27.0 — Consonant agent: pick up B from on C and place B on the table.
28. t=27.0–28.0 — Consonant agent: pick up C from on D and place C on the table.
29. t=28.0–29.0 — Consonant agent: pick up D from on E and place D on the table.
30. t=29.0–30.0 — Consonant agent: pick up C from the table and place C on top of D.
31. t=30.0–31.0 — Consonant agent: pick up B from the table and place B on top of C.

36. t=35.0–36.0 — Vowel agent: pick up A from the table and place A on top of B.
37. t=36.0–37.0 — Consonant agent: pick up B from the table and place B on top of C.
38. t=37.0–38.0 — Consonant agent: pick up C from on D and place C on top of A.
39. t=38.0–39.0 — Consonant agent: pick up D from the table and place D on top of E.
40. t=39.0–40.0 — Consonant agent: pick up C from on A and place C on top of D.
41. t=40.0–41.0 — Consonant agent: pick up B from the table and place B on top of C.
42. t=41.0–42.0 — Vowel agent: pick up A from the table and place A on top of B.

Final state achieved (after t=42.0): single tower with bottom-to-top order L, K, J, I, H, G, F, E, D, C, B, A (L on the table and A on top), matching the specified goal.
