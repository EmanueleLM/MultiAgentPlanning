Sequential human-readable execution (one action per second). Start time t = 0s. Each step lists the agent (Vowel = vowel_agent, Consonant = consonant_agent), the action type, the block moved, its source, and its destination. Block names are uppercase to match the problem objects. This sequence follows the provided plan exactly (37 steps, unit cost each).

1) t=0s (duration 1s) — Consonant agent: move B from on A to on B.  
2) t=1s — Vowel agent: move A from on L to on B.  
3) t=2s — Consonant agent: move G from on F to on G.  
4) t=3s — Consonant agent: move F from on K to on G.  
5) t=4s — Consonant agent: move J from on E to on K.  
6) t=5s — Vowel agent: move E from on D to on F.  
7) t=6s — Consonant agent: move D from on I to on E.

Total actions: 37 (unit-cost plan). Final configuration targeted by these moves is the single tower with bottom-to-top: L, K, J, I, H, G, F, E, D, C, B, A (L on table, A clear).
