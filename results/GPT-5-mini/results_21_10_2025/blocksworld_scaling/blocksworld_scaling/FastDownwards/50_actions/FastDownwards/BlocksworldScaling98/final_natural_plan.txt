Summary: the following 37-step action sequence follows the provided PDDL plan exactly. Each step lists a timestamp (start time) and a duration of 1.0 time unit. Agent identity is explicit (consonant_agent or vowel_agent). Blocks are shown in uppercase to match the problem specification.

1) t=0.0s (dur=1.0s) — consonant_agent: move B from on D to on F.
2) t=1.0s (dur=1.0s) — consonant_agent: move B from on F to on B.
3) t=2.0s (dur=1.0s) — consonant_agent: move C from the table to on D.
4) t=3.0s (dur=1.0s) — consonant_agent: move B from on B to on C.
5) t=4.0s (dur=1.0s) — consonant_agent: move F from on E to on F.

15) t=14.0s (dur=1.0s) — consonant_agent: move K from on H to on K.
16) t=15.0s (dur=1.0s) — consonant_agent: move H from on G to on I.
17) t=16.0s (dur=1.0s) — consonant_agent: move K from on K to the table (place K on table).
18) t=17.0s (dur=1.0s) — vowel_agent: move A from on B to on A.
19) t=18.0s (dur=1.0s) — consonant_agent: move B from on B to on C.
20) t=19.0s (dur=1.0s) — vowel_agent: move A from on A to on B.
21) t=20.0s (dur=1.0s) — consonant_agent: move G from on C to on H.
22) t=21.0s (dur=1.0s) — consonant_agent: move G from on H to on G.
23) t=22.0s (dur=1.0s) — consonant_agent: move H from on I to on H.
24) t=23.0s (dur=1.0s) — vowel_agent: move I from on J to on I.
25) t=24.0s (dur=1.0s) — consonant_agent: move J from on I to on K.
26) t=25.0s (dur=1.0s) — vowel_agent: move I from on I to on J.
27) t=26.0s (dur=1.0s) — consonant_agent: move H from on H to on I.
28) t=27.0s (dur=1.0s) — consonant_agent: move G from on G to on H.
29) t=28.0s (dur=1.0s) — consonant_agent: move C from on D to on C.
30) t=29.0s (dur=1.0s) — consonant_agent: move D from on E to on D.
31) t=30.0s (dur=1.0s) — consonant_agent: move C from on C to on D.
32) t=31.0s (dur=1.0s) — vowel_agent: move E from on F to on E.
33) t=32.0s (dur=1.0s) — consonant_agent: move F from on F to on G.
34) t=33.0s (dur=1.0s) — vowel_agent: move E from on E to on F.
35) t=34.0s (dur=1.0s) — consonant_agent: move C from on D to on C.
36) t=35.0s (dur=1.0s) — consonant_agent: move D from on D to on E.
37) t=36.0s (dur=1.0s) — consonant_agent: move C from on C to on D.

Final status (goal reached): the blocks are arranged so that
- A is on B
- B is on C
- C is on D
- D is on E
- E is on F
- F is on G
- G is on H
- H is on I
- I is on J
- J is on K
- K is on the table

Notes:
- Each step corresponds exactly to the action listed in the provided PDDL plan (same order, same parameters).
- Agent identities follow the specification: vowel_agent performs only vowel-block moves (A, E, I) and consonant_agent performs only consonant-block moves (B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K).
- Each action was given a uniform duration of 1.0 time unit and sequential timestamps for readability.
