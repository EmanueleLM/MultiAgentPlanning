1) Schedule meeting — Monday 09:00–09:30 (30 minutes)
   - Action taken (PDDL): schedule-meeting t0900 joyce joyce joyce
   - Intended timestamp: start 09:00, end 09:30 (time slot t0900)
   - Participants bound in the action: joyce (used for all three person parameters)
   - Effects achieved: meeting-scheduled = true; scheduled-at = t0900

Note: The plan binds all three person parameters to Joyce, so the meeting is created at 09:00–09:30 based solely on Joyce’s availability. This satisfies the PDDL goal (meeting-scheduled) in the provided plan; it does not include Christine or Alexander as attendees.
