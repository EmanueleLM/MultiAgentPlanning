Planned action (following the PDDL plan):

1) Schedule the 30-minute meeting on Monday from 16:30 to 17:00 (slot s1630_1700).
   - Participants: Heather, Nicholas, Zachary
   - Duration: 30 minutes (16:30–17:00)
   - Rationale: All three participants are available at this slot.
   - Note on preference: This slot is dispreferred for Zachary (he prefers not to meet after 14:00), so the plan uses the dispreferred scheduling action.
   - Effect: Meeting is scheduled at 16:30–17:00; this incurs a cost of 1 (reflecting the violated soft preference). Final goal (scheduled) is achieved.
