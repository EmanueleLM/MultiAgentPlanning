Step 1 — Schedule meeting m1 at 11:00 on Monday (30 minutes: 11:00–11:30)
- Action taken: Schedule the single 30-minute meeting (m1) to start at 11:00 on Monday.
- Participants required and included: Adam, Jerry, Matthew.
- Reasoning / validity: Adam, Jerry, and Matthew are all available at the 11:00 30-minute timeslot, so the meeting can be scheduled.
- Effects: m1 is now scheduled at 11:00–11:30; Adam, Jerry, and Matthew are no longer free for that timeslot.
- Goal status: Achieved — the 30-minute meeting has been scheduled for Monday between 09:00 and 17:00.
