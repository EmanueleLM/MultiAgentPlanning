PROBLEM
------------------------------
I am playing with a set of blocks where I need to arrange the blocks into stacks. Here are the actions I can do

Pick up a block
Unstack a block from on top of another block
Put down a block
Stack a block on top of another block

I have the following restrictions on my actions:
I can only pick up or unstack one block at a time.
I can only pick up or unstack a block if my hand is empty.
I can only pick up a block if the block is on the table and the block is clear. A block is clear if the block has no other blocks on top of it and if the block is not picked up.
I can only unstack a block from on top of another block if the block I am unstacking was really on top of the other block.
I can only unstack a block from on top of another block if the block I am unstacking is clear.
Once I pick up or unstack a block, I am holding the block.
I can only put down a block that I am holding.
I can only stack a block on top of another block if I am holding the block being stacked.
I can only stack a block on top of another block if the block onto which I am stacking the block is clear.
Once I put down or stack a block, my hand becomes empty.
Once you stack a block on top of a second block, the second block is no longer clear.

[STATEMENT]
As initial conditions I have that, the blue block is clear, the hand is empty, the blue block is on top of the orange block, the orange block is on top of the yellow block, the yellow block is on top of the red block and the red block is on the table.
My goal is to have that the red block is on top of the orange block and the yellow block is on top of the red block.

My plan is as follows:

[PLAN]
unstack the blue block from on top of the orange block
put down the blue block
unstack the orange block from on top of the yellow block
put down the orange block
unstack the yellow block from on top of the red block
stack the yellow block on top of the blue block
pick up the red block
stack the red block on top of the orange block
unstack the yellow block from on top of the blue block
stack the yellow block on top of the red block
[PLAN END]

NATURAL-PLAN sas_plan_1
------------------------------
Plan execution timeline (agent: player1). Each action is executed sequentially, 1.0s duration per action (timestamps shown as start–end). After each step I list the principal effects on the world state.

Step 1 — t=0.0s–1.0s
Action: unstack player1 blue from orange
Preconditions met: blue is on orange, blue is clear, player1’s hand is empty.
Effects: player1 is holding blue; blue is no longer on orange; orange becomes clear; player1’s hand is no longer empty.

Step 2 — t=1.0s–2.0s
Action: put-down player1 blue
Preconditions met: player1 is holding blue.
Effects: blue is placed on the table (OnTable blue); blue becomes clear; player1’s hand becomes empty; player1 is no longer holding blue.

Step 3 — t=2.0s–3.0s
Action: unstack player1 orange from yellow
Preconditions met: orange is on yellow, orange is clear, player1’s hand is empty.
Effects: player1 is holding orange; orange is no longer on yellow; yellow becomes clear; player1’s hand is no longer empty.

Step 4 — t=3.0s–4.0s
Action: put-down player1 orange
Preconditions met: player1 is holding orange.
Effects: orange is placed on the table (OnTable orange); orange becomes clear; player1’s hand becomes empty; player1 is no longer holding orange.

Step 5 — t=4.0s–5.0s
Action: unstack player1 yellow from red
Preconditions met: yellow is on red, yellow is clear, player1’s hand is empty.
Effects: player1 is holding yellow; yellow is no longer on red; red becomes clear; player1’s hand is no longer empty.

Step 6 — t=5.0s–6.0s
Action: put-down player1 yellow
Preconditions met: player1 is holding yellow.
Effects: yellow is placed on the table (OnTable yellow); yellow becomes clear; player1’s hand becomes empty; player1 is no longer holding yellow.

Step 7 — t=6.0s–7.0s
Action: pick-up player1 red
Preconditions met: red is on the table and clear, player1’s hand is empty.
Effects: player1 is holding red; red is no longer OnTable; player1’s hand is no longer empty; red is not clear while held.

Step 8 — t=7.0s–8.0s
Action: stack player1 red on orange
Preconditions met: player1 is holding red, orange is clear.
Effects: red is placed on orange (On red orange); orange is no longer clear; red becomes clear; player1’s hand becomes empty; player1 is no longer holding red.

Step 9 — t=8.0s–9.0s
Action: pick-up player1 yellow
Preconditions met: yellow is on the table and clear, player1’s hand is empty.
Effects: player1 is holding yellow; yellow is no longer OnTable; player1’s hand is no longer empty; yellow is not clear while held.

Step 10 — t=9.0s–10.0s
Action: stack player1 yellow on red
Preconditions met: player1 is holding yellow, red is clear.
Effects: yellow is placed on red (On yellow red); red is no longer clear; yellow becomes clear; player1’s hand becomes empty; player1 is no longer holding yellow.

Final state summary (after t=10.0s):
- On red orange (red directly on orange)
- On yellow red (yellow directly on red)
- blue is on the table and clear
- orange has red on top? (orange is under red; orange is not clear)
- player1’s hand is empty

Goal verification:
- Goal from the specification for this run (player1): On red orange AND On yellow red — both are satisfied.

Plan cost: 10 (unit cost), total duration 10.0s.

PROBLEM
------------------------------
I am playing with a set of blocks where I need to arrange the blocks into stacks. Here are the actions I can do

Pick up a block
Unstack a block from on top of another block
Put down a block
Stack a block on top of another block

I have the following restrictions on my actions:
I can only pick up or unstack one block at a time.
I can only pick up or unstack a block if my hand is empty.
I can only pick up a block if the block is on the table and the block is clear. A block is clear if the block has no other blocks on top of it and if the block is not picked up.
I can only unstack a block from on top of another block if the block I am unstacking was really on top of the other block.
I can only unstack a block from on top of another block if the block I am unstacking is clear.
Once I pick up or unstack a block, I am holding the block.
I can only put down a block that I am holding.
I can only stack a block on top of another block if I am holding the block being stacked.
I can only stack a block on top of another block if the block onto which I am stacking the block is clear.
Once I put down or stack a block, my hand becomes empty.
Once you stack a block on top of a second block, the second block is no longer clear.

[STATEMENT]
As initial conditions I have that, the yellow block is clear, the hand is empty, the red block is on top of the orange block, the orange block is on top of the blue block, the yellow block is on top of the red block and the blue block is on the table.
My goal is to have that the red block is on top of the yellow block and the yellow block is on top of the blue block.

My plan is as follows:

[PLAN]
unstack the yellow block from on top of the red block
put down the yellow block
unstack the red block from on top of the orange block
put down the red block
unstack the orange block from on top of the blue block
put down the orange block
pick up the yellow block
stack the yellow block on top of the blue block
pick up the red block
stack the red block on top of the yellow block
[PLAN END]

[STATEMENT]

NATURAL-PLAN sas_plan_3
------------------------------
Summary: Execute the following 12 actions exactly as given by the plan. Each action is performed by agent "player1". I list a timestamp (start time) with a 1.0s duration for each action (timestamps are cumulative and illustrative). After each step I state the immediate effects on the blocks relevant to the plan.

Step 1 — t = 0.0s, duration 1.0s
Action: unstack(player1, yellow, red)

Step 2 — t = 1.0s, duration 1.0s
Action: put-down(player1, yellow)
- Description: player1 puts yellow down onto the table.
- Preconditions satisfied: player1 is holding yellow.
- Effects: yellow is on the table; yellow becomes clear; player1's hand becomes empty; player1 no longer holds yellow.

Step 3 — t = 2.0s, duration 1.0s
Action: unstack(player1, red, orange)
- Description: player1 un-stacks red from on top of orange.
- Preconditions satisfied: player1's hand is empty; red is on orange; red is clear (from step 1).
- Effects: player1 is holding red; red is no longer on orange; orange becomes clear; player1's hand is not empty.

State note after step 3: holding(player1, red); orange clear; red in-hand.

Step 4 — t = 3.0s, duration 1.0s
Action: stack(player1, red, yellow)
- Description: player1 stacks the held red on top of yellow.
- Preconditions satisfied: player1 is holding red; yellow is clear (it was put down and remained clear).
- Effects: red is on yellow; red becomes clear; yellow becomes not clear; player1's hand becomes empty; player1 no longer holds red.

State note after step 4: on(red, yellow); yellow not clear; handempty(player1).

Step 5 — t = 4.0s, duration 1.0s
Action: unstack(player1, orange, blue)
- Description: player1 un-stacks orange from on top of blue.
- Preconditions satisfied: player1's hand is empty; orange is on blue; orange is clear (from step 3).
- Effects: player1 is holding orange; orange is no longer on blue; blue becomes clear; player1's hand not empty.

State note after step 5: holding(player1, orange); blue clear.

Step 6 — t = 5.0s, duration 1.0s
Action: put-down(player1, orange)
- Description: player1 puts orange down onto the table.
- Preconditions satisfied: player1 is holding orange.
- Effects: orange is on the table and clear; player1's hand becomes empty; player1 no longer holds orange.

State note after step 6: on-table(orange); orange clear; handempty(player1); blue clear.

Step 7 — t = 6.0s, duration 1.0s
Action: unstack(player1, red, yellow)
- Description: player1 un-stacks red from on top of yellow (taking red off yellow).
- Preconditions satisfied: player1's hand is empty; red is on yellow; red is clear (from step 4).
- Effects: player1 is holding red; red is no longer on yellow; yellow becomes clear; player1's hand not empty.

State note after step 7: holding(player1, red); yellow clear.

Step 8 — t = 7.0s, duration 1.0s
Action: put-down(player1, red)
- Description: player1 puts red down onto the table.
- Preconditions satisfied: player1 is holding red.
- Effects: red is on the table and clear; player1's hand becomes empty; player1 no longer holds red.

State note after step 8: on-table(red); red clear; yellow clear; handempty(player1).

Step 9 — t = 8.0s, duration 1.0s
Action: pick-up(player1, yellow)
- Description: player1 picks up yellow from the table.
- Preconditions satisfied: player1's hand is empty; yellow is on the table; yellow is clear.
- Effects: player1 is holding yellow; yellow is no longer on the table; yellow is not clear; player1's hand not empty.

State note after step 9: holding(player1, yellow); yellow not clear.

Step 10 — t = 9.0s, duration 1.0s
Action: stack(player1, yellow, blue)
- Description: player1 stacks the held yellow on top of blue.
- Preconditions satisfied: player1 is holding yellow; blue is clear (from step 5).
- Effects: yellow is on blue; yellow becomes clear; blue becomes not clear; player1's hand becomes empty; player1 no longer holds yellow.

State note after step 10: on(yellow, blue); yellow clear; blue not clear; handempty(player1).

Step 11 — t = 10.0s, duration 1.0s
Action: pick-up(player1, red)
- Description: player1 picks up red from the table.
- Preconditions satisfied: player1's hand is empty; red is on the table; red is clear.
- Effects: player1 is holding red; red no longer on table; red not clear; player1's hand not empty.

State note after step 11: holding(player1, red).

Step 12 — t = 11.0s, duration 1.0s
Action: stack(player1, red, yellow)
- Description: player1 stacks the held red on top of yellow.
- Preconditions satisfied: player1 is holding red; yellow is clear (from step 10).
- Effects: red is on yellow; red becomes clear; yellow becomes not clear; player1's hand becomes empty; player1 no longer holds red.

State note after step 12 (final): on(red, yellow); on(yellow, blue); handempty(player1).

Final verification:
- Goal achieved: (on red yellow) and (on yellow blue) — satisfied.
- All steps respect the domain rules (one block moved at a time; hand empty where required; only stack onto clear blocks; put-downs place blocks on the table).

PROBLEM
------------------------------
I am playing with a set of blocks where I need to arrange the blocks into stacks. Here are the actions I can do

Pick up a block
Unstack a block from on top of another block
Put down a block
Stack a block on top of another block

I have the following restrictions on my actions:
I can only pick up or unstack one block at a time.
I can only pick up or unstack a block if my hand is empty.
I can only pick up a block if the block is on the table and the block is clear. A block is clear if the block has no other blocks on top of it and if the block is not picked up.
I can only unstack a block from on top of another block if the block I am unstacking was really on top of the other block.
I can only unstack a block from on top of another block if the block I am unstacking is clear.
Once I pick up or unstack a block, I am holding the block.
I can only put down a block that I am holding.
I can only stack a block on top of another block if I am holding the block being stacked.
I can only stack a block on top of another block if the block onto which I am stacking the block is clear.
Once I put down or stack a block, my hand becomes empty.
Once you stack a block on top of a second block, the second block is no longer clear.

[STATEMENT]
As initial conditions I have that, the orange block is clear, the yellow block is clear, the hand is empty, the blue block is on top of the red block, the orange block is on top of the blue block, the red block is on the table and the yellow block is on the table.
My goal is to have that the blue block is on top of the red block and the yellow block is on top of the orange block.

My plan is as follows:

[PLAN]
pick up the yellow block
stack the yellow block on top of the orange block
[PLAN END]

[STATEMENT]
As initial conditions I have that, the yellow block is clear, the hand is empty, the red block is on top of the orange block, the orange block is on top of the blue block, the yellow block is on top of the red block and the blue block is on the table.

NATURAL-PLAN sas_plan_1
------------------------------
Action sequence (matches the given plan exactly). Each action is 1 time unit long; timeline starts at t=0. Total cost = 2.

1) t = 0.0 → 1.0 — pick-up yellow
   - Description: Pick up the yellow block from the table.
   - Required preconditions (satisfied in the initial state): yellow is on the table, yellow is clear, hand is empty.
   - Effects after execution: you are holding yellow; yellow is no longer on the table; yellow is not clear; your hand is no longer empty.

2) t = 1.0 → 2.0 — stack yellow orange
   - Description: Place the held yellow block onto the orange block.
   - Required preconditions (satisfied at t=1.0): you are holding yellow; orange is clear.
   - Effects after execution: yellow is on orange; orange is no longer clear; yellow becomes clear; you are no longer holding anything (hand becomes empty).

Result after t = 2.0:
- Goal achieved: blue is on red (already true initially) and yellow is on orange (established by step 2).
- Hand is empty.

PROBLEM
------------------------------
I am playing with a set of blocks where I need to arrange the blocks into stacks. Here are the actions I can do

Pick up a block
Unstack a block from on top of another block
Put down a block
Stack a block on top of another block

I have the following restrictions on my actions:
I can only pick up or unstack one block at a time.
I can only pick up or unstack a block if my hand is empty.
I can only pick up a block if the block is on the table and the block is clear. A block is clear if the block has no other blocks on top of it and if the block is not picked up.
I can only unstack a block from on top of another block if the block I am unstacking was really on top of the other block.
I can only unstack a block from on top of another block if the block I am unstacking is clear.
Once I pick up or unstack a block, I am holding the block.
I can only put down a block that I am holding.
I can only stack a block on top of another block if I am holding the block being stacked.
I can only stack a block on top of another block if the block onto which I am stacking the block is clear.
Once I put down or stack a block, my hand becomes empty.
Once you stack a block on top of a second block, the second block is no longer clear.

[STATEMENT]

put down the orange block
unstack the red block from on top of the yellow block
stack the red block on top of the blue block
pick up the yellow block

================================================================================


FINAL-PLAN
------------------------------
I don’t have the agent summaries / scenario descriptions you referred to — they’re required to produce the exact PDDL problem instances and to avoid inventing availability or constraints. Please provide the agent inputs (capabilities, which agents can do which actions, initial configurations of blocks, goals, and any hard constraints such as “Agent A must not move block X”, availability windows, or exclusivity). Treat natural-language constraints as hard requirements.

To help you supply the missing data, please give:

- A list of agents (names).
- A list of blocks (names) and table locations if needed.
- For each agent: which actions they are allowed to perform (pick-up, unstack, put-down, stack). If all agents have same capabilities, say so.
- Initial state: which block is on which block or on the table, which blocks are clear, which agents (if any) are holding something initially.
- Goals for each scenario (one scenario per problem file). If there are multiple scenarios, give each separately.
- Any hard constraints/preferences that must be enforced (e.g., “Agent A must not pick up block b1”, “b2 must be placed on table before b3 is stacked”, “no agent may hold more than one block”, “block b4 is immovable”, “agent B must act before agent A”, etc.). Treat these as strict constraints.
- If any temporal ordering (earliest, avoid) should be treated as constraints, specify them explicitly (e.g., “Agent A cannot move until block X is on the table”).

If helpful, here is the domain layout I will produce once you provide the above (this is only an illustration; I will produce fully-expanded, exact PDDL files for FastDownwards once I have your data):

- Domain header will include only :requirements (:strips :typing :negative-preconditions). Types: agent, block, place (table).
- Predicates will include:
  - (agent ?ag) and (block ?b) typed
  - (on ?b ?x) where ?x is block or table constant
  - (ontable ?b)
  - (clear ?b)
  - (holding ?ag ?b)
  - (handempty ?ag)
  - (available ?ag) if you need agent availability constraints
  - any additional predicate encoding constraints you specify (e.g., (cannot-move ?ag ?b))

- Actions (agent-specific names will be used if required):
  - pick-up-<agent> or pickup (?ag - agent ?b - block)
    - preconditions: (ontable ?b) (clear ?b) (handempty ?ag) and any agent-specific permission
    - effects: (holding ?ag ?b) (not (ontable ?b)) (not (clear ?b)) (not (handempty ?ag))
  - unstack-<agent> or unstack (?ag - agent ?b - block ?c - block)
    - preconditions: (on ?b ?c) (clear ?b) (handempty ?ag) and any agent permissions
    - effects: (holding ?ag ?b) (clear ?c) (not (on ?b ?c)) (not (clear ?b)) (not (handempty ?ag))
  - put-down-<agent> or putdown (?ag - agent ?b - block)
    - preconditions: (holding ?ag ?b)
    - effects: (ontable ?b) (clear ?b) (handempty ?ag) (not (holding ?ag ?b))
  - stack-<agent> or stack (?ag - agent ?b - block ?c - block)
    - preconditions: (holding ?ag ?b) (clear ?c)
    - effects: (on ?b ?c) (clear ?b) (handempty ?ag) (not (holding ?ag ?b)) (not (clear ?c))

- Each problem file will include :objects listing agents and blocks, :init listing initial on/ontable/clear/handempty predicates, and :goal listing conjunctive goal facts; any hard constraints from your input will be encoded as additional initial predicates and preconditions (e.g., (cannot-move ag b) modeled as (not-allowed) and used in action preconditions as (not (cannot-move ?ag ?b))).

Once you provide the missing scenario inputs, I will produce:
- One complete PDDL domain enclosed in <domain></domain> tags including only the allowed :requirements.
- One or more PDDL problem instances (one per scenario) enclosed in <problem></problem> tags, ready for FastDownwards.

If you prefer, supply one scenario now and I’ll produce the domain plus that single problem immediately.

Header: Plan for Blocksworld5 (intended for human inspection; actions match the provided PDDL plan). Each action is 1 time unit; timestamps show start → end. Total cost = 10.

Initial state (t = 0):
- On table: blue
- on orange blue
- on red orange
- on yellow red
- clear: yellow
- handempty: true
- (red, orange, blue are not clear)

Step 1 (t=0 → t=1): unstack yellow from red
- Action: unstack(yellow, red)
- Preconditions checked before action: on(yellow, red) ✓, clear(yellow) ✓, handempty ✓
- Effects applied: remove on(yellow, red); holding(yellow); clear(red) becomes true; yellow is no longer clear; handempty becomes false
- Resulting state highlights: holding yellow; red is clear.

Step 2 (t=1 → t=2): putdown yellow
- Action: putdown(yellow)
- Preconditions: holding(yellow) ✓
- Effects: yellow becomes ontable; yellow becomes clear; holding(yellow) removed; handempty becomes true
- Resulting state highlights: yellow on table and clear; handempty true.

Step 3 (t=2 → t=3): unstack red from orange
- Action: unstack(red, orange)
- Preconditions: on(red, orange) ✓, clear(red) ✓ (made clear in Step 1), handempty ✓
- Effects: remove on(red, orange); holding(red); clear(orange) becomes true; red no longer clear; handempty false
- Resulting state highlights: holding red; orange is clear.

Step 4 (t=3 → t=4): putdown red
- Action: putdown(red)
- Preconditions: holding(red) ✓
- Effects: red becomes ontable; red becomes clear; holding(red) removed; handempty true
- Resulting state highlights: red on table and clear; handempty true.

Step 5 (t=4 → t=5): unstack orange from blue
- Action: unstack(orange, blue)
- Preconditions: on(orange, blue) ✓, clear(orange) ✓ (made clear in Step 3), handempty ✓
- Effects: remove on(orange, blue); holding(orange); clear(blue) becomes true; orange no longer clear; handempty false
- Resulting state highlights: holding orange; blue is clear.

Step 6 (t=5 → t=6): putdown orange
- Action: putdown(orange)
- Preconditions: holding(orange) ✓
- Effects: orange becomes ontable; orange becomes clear; holding(orange) removed; handempty true
- Resulting state highlights: orange on table and clear; handempty true.

Step 7 (t=6 → t=7): pickup red
- Action: pickup(red)
- Preconditions: ontable(red) ✓ (from Step 4), clear(red) ✓, handempty ✓
- Effects: remove ontable(red); holding(red); red no longer clear; handempty false
- Resulting state highlights: holding red.

Step 8 (t=7 → t=8): stack red on blue
- Action: stack(red, blue)
- Preconditions: holding(red) ✓, clear(blue) ✓ (made clear in Step 5) ✓
- Effects: on(red, blue) becomes true; clear(blue) becomes false; clear(red) becomes true; holding(red) removed; handempty true
- Resulting state highlights: red on blue; handempty true.

Step 9 (t=8 → t=9): pickup yellow
- Action: pickup(yellow)
- Preconditions: ontable(yellow) ✓ (from Step 2), clear(yellow) ✓, handempty ✓
- Effects: remove ontable(yellow); holding(yellow); yellow no longer clear; handempty false
- Resulting state highlights: holding yellow.

Step 10 (t=9 → t=10): stack yellow on orange
- Action: stack(yellow, orange)
- Preconditions: holding(yellow) ✓, clear(orange) ✓ (orange was put on table and remained clear) ✓
- Effects: on(yellow, orange) becomes true; clear(orange) becomes false; clear(yellow) becomes true; holding(yellow) removed; handempty true
- Resulting state highlights: yellow on orange; handempty true.

Final state (t = 10):
- on(red, blue) ✓
- on(yellow, orange) ✓
- Hand is empty.
- Goal satisfied: (on red blue) and (on yellow orange).

Summary:
- All plan steps (10 actions) were applied in the given order; each action's preconditions were satisfied at execution time and effects were applied as per the domain rules.
- Total plan duration / cost = 10 time units.

PROBLEM
------------------------------
I am playing with a set of blocks where I need to arrange the blocks into stacks. Here are the actions I can do

Pick up a block
Unstack a block from on top of another block
Put down a block
Stack a block on top of another block

I have the following restrictions on my actions:
I can only pick up or unstack one block at a time.
I can only pick up or unstack a block if my hand is empty.
I can only pick up a block if the block is on the table and the block is clear. A block is clear if the block has no other blocks on top of it and if the block is not picked up.
I can only unstack a block from on top of another block if the block I am unstacking was really on top of the other block.
I can only unstack a block from on top of another block if the block I am unstacking is clear.
Once I pick up or unstack a block, I am holding the block.
I can only put down a block that I am holding.
I can only stack a block on top of another block if I am holding the block being stacked.
I can only stack a block on top of another block if the block onto which I am stacking the block is clear.
Once I put down or stack a block, my hand becomes empty.
Once you stack a block on top of a second block, the second block is no longer clear.

[STATEMENT]
As initial conditions I have that, the red block is clear, the hand is empty, the red block is on top of the yellow block, the blue block is on top of the orange block, the yellow block is on top of the blue block and the orange block is on the table.
My goal is to have that the red block is on top of the orange block.

My plan is as follows:

[PLAN]
unstack the red block from on top of the yellow block
put down the red block
unstack the yellow block from on top of the blue block
put down the yellow block
unstack the blue block from on top of the orange block
put down the blue block
pick up the red block
stack the red block on top of the orange block
[PLAN END]

NATURAL-PLAN sas_plan_1
------------------------------
Below is a clear, step-by-step human-readable execution of the given plan. Each step is listed in order (no steps added or removed), with an estimated timestamp (starting at 00:00:00 and advancing by 10 seconds per action), a short natural-language description, concise preconditions required for the action to be legal at that moment, and the immediate effects on the world state.

00:00:00 — Step 1 — Unstack blue from orange

- Effects: agent is holding yellow; yellow is no longer on the table; hand is no longer empty.

00:00:50 — Step 6 — Stack yellow onto orange
- Action: Place the held yellow block on top of the orange block (stack yellow orange).
- Preconditions: agent is holding yellow; orange is clear.
- Effects: yellow is on orange; yellow becomes clear; orange becomes not clear (now supporting yellow); agent's hand becomes empty; agent is no longer holding yellow.

00:01:00 — Step 7 — Unstack red from blue

PROBLEM
------------------------------
I am playing with a set of blocks where I need to arrange the blocks into stacks. Here are the actions I can do

Pick up a block
Unstack a block from on top of another block
Put down a block
Stack a block on top of another block

I have the following restrictions on my actions:
I can only pick up or unstack one block at a time.
I can only pick up or unstack a block if my hand is empty.
I can only pick up a block if the block is on the table and the block is clear. A block is clear if the block has no other blocks on top of it and if the block is not picked up.
I can only unstack a block from on top of another block if the block I am unstacking was really on top of the other block.
I can only unstack a block from on top of another block if the block I am unstacking is clear.
Once I pick up or unstack a block, I am holding the block.
I can only put down a block that I am holding.
I can only stack a block on top of another block if I am holding the block being stacked.
I can only stack a block on top of another block if the block onto which I am stacking the block is clear.
Once I put down or stack a block, my hand becomes empty.
Once you stack a block on top of a second block, the second block is no longer clear.

[STATEMENT]
As initial conditions I have that, the red block is clear, the blue block is clear, the yellow block is clear, the hand is empty, the blue block is on top of the orange block, the red block is on the table, the orange block is on the table and the yellow block is on the table.
My goal is to have that the red block is on top of the blue block, the blue block is on top of the yellow block and the yellow block is on top of the orange block.

My plan is as follows:

[PLAN]
unstack the blue block from on top of the orange block

[PLAN]
================================================================================


FINAL-PLAN
------------------------------
I don't have the two fragments (fragment_agent1 and fragment_agent2) you referenced. I can't invent or assume details, because you asked me not to make unstated assumptions and to encode preferences as hard constraints.

Please provide the two agent fragments. To make integration straightforward, include for each fragment at least:
- A list of objects (blocks and table, and any agents if relevant).
- Initial facts, e.g. (on A B), (ontable C), (clear A), (handempty), (holding X) if applicable.
- Agent capabilities or action restrictions that differ from usual blocks world (e.g. an agent can't pick up certain blocks, or must not stack on certain blocks, or public constraints describing what is observable/shared).
- The goal condition for that scenario (as a conjunction of atoms).
- Any hard temporal constraints phrased as absolute restrictions (e.g. "A must not be moved" -> treat as invariant that A stays put).

If it helps, you can paste fragments in this form (example):
fragment_agent1:
objects: A B C table
initial: (ontable A) (on B A) (on C table) (clear B) (clear C) (handempty)
capabilities: agent1 can pick-up, put-down, stack, unstack; cannot pick-up A
goal: (on B C) (on A table)

fragment_agent2:
objects: D E table
initial: ...
capabilities: ...
goal: ...

Once you provide the two fragments I will:
- Build a single PDDL domain (STRIPS-compatible, :typing and :negative-preconditions allowed) modeling pick-up, put-down, stack, and unstack, with action variants or preconditions to capture agent-specific constraints where necessary.
- Produce one PDDL problem per fragment enclosed in <problem>...</problem>, and the domain enclosed in <domain>...</domain>, ready for FastDownwards.

If you prefer, you can also tell me whether agents are represented in the domain (multi-agent predicates) or whether agent-specific constraints are encoded by creating separate actions (e.g., pick-up-agent1, pick-up-agent2).

PROBLEM
------------------------------
I am playing with a set of blocks where I need to arrange the blocks into stacks. Here are the actions I can do

Pick up a block
Unstack a block from on top of another block
Put down a block
Stack a block on top of another block

I have the following restrictions on my actions:
I can only pick up or unstack one block at a time.
I can only pick up or unstack a block if my hand is empty.
I can only pick up a block if the block is on the table and the block is clear. A block is clear if the block has no other blocks on top of it and if the block is not picked up.
I can only unstack a block from on top of another block if the block I am unstacking was really on top of the other block.
I can only unstack a block from on top of another block if the block I am unstacking is clear.
Once I pick up or unstack a block, I am holding the block.
I can only put down a block that I am holding.
I can only stack a block on top of another block if I am holding the block being stacked.
I can only stack a block on top of another block if the block onto which I am stacking the block is clear.
Once I put down or stack a block, my hand becomes empty.
Once you stack a block on top of a second block, the second block is no longer clear.

[STATEMENT]
As initial conditions I have that, the blue block is clear, the orange block is clear, the hand is empty, the orange block is on top of the yellow block, the yellow block is on top of the red block, the red block is on the table and the blue block is on the table.
My goal is to have that the red block is on top of the orange block, the blue block is on top of the red block and the yellow block is on top of the blue block.

My plan is as follows:

[PLAN]
unstack the orange block from on top of the yellow block
put down the orange block
unstack the yellow block from on top of the red block
put down the yellow block
pick up the red block
stack the red block on top of the orange block
pick up the blue block
stack the blue block on top of the red block
pick up the yellow block
stack the yellow block on top of the blue block
[PLAN END]

NATURAL-PLAN sas_plan_1
------------------------------
Plan execution (12 steps). Each action is listed in the same order as the provided plan. Assume each action takes 1 time unit; timestamps show the start time of each action (start at t=0).

t=0 — Step 1: unstack(orange, yellow)
- Human description: Lift orange off of yellow (unstack orange from on top of yellow).
- Required preconditions: orange is on yellow, orange is clear, hand is empty.
- Immediate effects: orange is no longer on yellow; you are holding orange; orange is no longer clear; yellow becomes clear; hand becomes not empty.

t=1 — Step 2: put-down(orange)
- Human description: Put the held orange down onto the table.
- Required preconditions: you are holding orange.
- Immediate effects: orange is on the table; orange becomes clear; you are no longer holding orange; hand becomes empty.

t=2 — Step 3: unstack(yellow, red)
- Human description: Lift yellow off of red (unstack yellow from on top of red).
- Required preconditions: yellow is on red, yellow is clear, hand is empty.
- Immediate effects: yellow is no longer on red; you are holding yellow; yellow is no longer clear; red becomes clear; hand becomes not empty.

t=3 — Step 4: stack(yellow, blue)
- Human description: Place the held yellow onto blue (stack yellow on top of blue).
- Required preconditions: you are holding yellow, blue is clear.
- Immediate effects: yellow is on blue; yellow becomes clear (as modeled in the domain); blue becomes not clear; you are no longer holding yellow; hand becomes empty.

t=4 — Step 5: pick-up(red)
- Human description: Pick up red from the table.
- Required preconditions: red is on the table, red is clear, hand is empty.
- Immediate effects: red is no longer on the table; you are holding red; red is not clear; hand becomes not empty.

t=5 — Step 6: stack(red, orange)
- Human description: Place the held red onto orange (stack red on top of orange).
- Required preconditions: you are holding red, orange is clear.
- Immediate effects: red is on orange; red becomes clear (per domain effect); orange becomes not clear; you are no longer holding red; hand becomes empty.

t=6 — Step 7: unstack(yellow, blue)
- Human description: Lift yellow off of blue (unstack yellow from on top of blue).
- Required preconditions: yellow is on blue, yellow is clear, hand is empty.
- Immediate effects: yellow is no longer on blue; you are holding yellow; yellow is no longer clear; blue becomes clear; hand becomes not empty.

t=7 — Step 8: put-down(yellow)
- Human description: Put the held yellow down onto the table.
- Required preconditions: you are holding yellow.
- Immediate effects: yellow is on the table; yellow becomes clear; you are no longer holding yellow; hand becomes empty.

t=8 — Step 9: pick-up(blue)
- Human description: Pick up blue from the table.
- Required preconditions: blue is on the table, blue is clear, hand is empty.
- Immediate effects: blue is no longer on the table; you are holding blue; blue is not clear; hand becomes not empty.

t=9 — Step 10: stack(blue, red)
- Human description: Place the held blue onto red (stack blue on top of red).
- Required preconditions: you are holding blue, red is clear.
- Immediate effects: blue is on red; blue becomes clear; red becomes not clear; you are no longer holding blue; hand becomes empty.

t=10 — Step 11: pick-up(yellow)
- Human description: Pick up yellow from the table.
- Required preconditions: yellow is on the table, yellow is clear, hand is empty.
- Immediate effects: yellow is no longer on the table; you are holding yellow; yellow is not clear; hand becomes not empty.

t=11 — Step 12: stack(yellow, blue)
- Human description: Place the held yellow onto blue (stack yellow on top of blue).
- Required preconditions: you are holding yellow, blue is clear.
- Immediate effects: yellow is on blue; yellow becomes clear; blue becomes not clear; you are no longer holding yellow; hand becomes empty.

Final state (relevant facts achieved)
- on red orange
- on blue red
- on yellow blue
- hand is empty

This sequence follows the provided plan exactly (12 actions), each step is applicable in sequence under the given domain rules and initial state, and the final goal is satisfied.
