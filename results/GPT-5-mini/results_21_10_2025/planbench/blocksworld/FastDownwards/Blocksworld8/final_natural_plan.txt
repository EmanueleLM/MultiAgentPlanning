Plan execution (12 steps). Each action is listed in the same order as the provided plan. Assume each action takes 1 time unit; timestamps show the start time of each action (start at t=0).

t=0 — Step 1: unstack(orange, yellow)
- Human description: Lift orange off of yellow (unstack orange from on top of yellow).
- Required preconditions: orange is on yellow, orange is clear, hand is empty.
- Immediate effects: orange is no longer on yellow; you are holding orange; orange is no longer clear; yellow becomes clear; hand becomes not empty.

t=1 — Step 2: put-down(orange)
- Human description: Put the held orange down onto the table.
- Required preconditions: you are holding orange.
- Immediate effects: orange is on the table; orange becomes clear; you are no longer holding orange; hand becomes empty.

t=2 — Step 3: unstack(yellow, red)
- Human description: Lift yellow off of red (unstack yellow from on top of red).
- Required preconditions: yellow is on red, yellow is clear, hand is empty.
- Immediate effects: yellow is no longer on red; you are holding yellow; yellow is no longer clear; red becomes clear; hand becomes not empty.

t=3 — Step 4: stack(yellow, blue)
- Human description: Place the held yellow onto blue (stack yellow on top of blue).
- Required preconditions: you are holding yellow, blue is clear.
- Immediate effects: yellow is on blue; yellow becomes clear (as modeled in the domain); blue becomes not clear; you are no longer holding yellow; hand becomes empty.

t=4 — Step 5: pick-up(red)
- Human description: Pick up red from the table.
- Required preconditions: red is on the table, red is clear, hand is empty.
- Immediate effects: red is no longer on the table; you are holding red; red is not clear; hand becomes not empty.

t=5 — Step 6: stack(red, orange)
- Human description: Place the held red onto orange (stack red on top of orange).
- Required preconditions: you are holding red, orange is clear.
- Immediate effects: red is on orange; red becomes clear (per domain effect); orange becomes not clear; you are no longer holding red; hand becomes empty.

t=6 — Step 7: unstack(yellow, blue)
- Human description: Lift yellow off of blue (unstack yellow from on top of blue).
- Required preconditions: yellow is on blue, yellow is clear, hand is empty.
- Immediate effects: yellow is no longer on blue; you are holding yellow; yellow is no longer clear; blue becomes clear; hand becomes not empty.

t=7 — Step 8: put-down(yellow)
- Human description: Put the held yellow down onto the table.
- Required preconditions: you are holding yellow.
- Immediate effects: yellow is on the table; yellow becomes clear; you are no longer holding yellow; hand becomes empty.

t=8 — Step 9: pick-up(blue)
- Human description: Pick up blue from the table.
- Required preconditions: blue is on the table, blue is clear, hand is empty.
- Immediate effects: blue is no longer on the table; you are holding blue; blue is not clear; hand becomes not empty.

t=9 — Step 10: stack(blue, red)
- Human description: Place the held blue onto red (stack blue on top of red).
- Required preconditions: you are holding blue, red is clear.
- Immediate effects: blue is on red; blue becomes clear; red becomes not clear; you are no longer holding blue; hand becomes empty.

t=10 — Step 11: pick-up(yellow)
- Human description: Pick up yellow from the table.
- Required preconditions: yellow is on the table, yellow is clear, hand is empty.
- Immediate effects: yellow is no longer on the table; you are holding yellow; yellow is not clear; hand becomes not empty.

t=11 — Step 12: stack(yellow, blue)
- Human description: Place the held yellow onto blue (stack yellow on top of blue).
- Required preconditions: you are holding yellow, blue is clear.
- Immediate effects: yellow is on blue; yellow becomes clear; blue becomes not clear; you are no longer holding yellow; hand becomes empty.

Final state (relevant facts achieved)
- on red orange
- on blue red
- on yellow blue
- hand is empty

This sequence follows the provided plan exactly (12 actions), each step is applicable in sequence under the given domain rules and initial state, and the final goal is satisfied.
