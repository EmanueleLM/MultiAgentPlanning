PROBLEM
------------------------------
I am playing with a set of blocks where I need to arrange the blocks into stacks. Here are the actions I can do

Pick up a block
Unstack a block from on top of another block
Put down a block
Stack a block on top of another block

I have the following restrictions on my actions:
I can only pick up or unstack one block at a time.
I can only pick up or unstack a block if my hand is empty.
I can only pick up a block if the block is on the table and the block is clear. A block is clear if the block has no other blocks on top of it and if the block is not picked up.
I can only unstack a block from on top of another block if the block I am unstacking was really on top of the other block.
I can only unstack a block from on top of another block if the block I am unstacking is clear.
Once I pick up or unstack a block, I am holding the block.
I can only put down a block that I am holding.
I can only stack a block on top of another block if I am holding the block being stacked.
I can only stack a block on top of another block if the block onto which I am stacking the block is clear.
Once I put down or stack a block, my hand becomes empty.
Once you stack a block on top of a second block, the second block is no longer clear.

[STATEMENT]
As initial conditions I have that, the red block is clear, the blue block is clear, the yellow block is clear, the hand is empty, the blue block is on top of the orange block, the red block is on the table, the orange block is on the table and the yellow block is on the table.
My goal is to have that the orange block is on top of the blue block.

My plan is as follows:

[PLAN]
unstack the blue block from on top of the orange block
put down the blue block
pick up the orange block
stack the orange block on top of the blue block
[PLAN END]

NATURAL-PLAN sas_plan_1
------------------------------
Step 1 — (consonant-move-from-table-to-block b c)
- Time: 2025-10-17T12:00:00Z (t = 0 s)
- Acting agent: consonant_agent
- Action: Move block B from the table onto block C.
- Duration (recorded): 1 s
- Notes: B is a consonant block and was clear on the table; C was clear. This move is permitted for the consonant agent.

Step 2 — (vowel-move-from-table-to-block a b)
- Time: 2025-10-17T12:00:01Z (t = 1 s)
- Acting agent: vowel_agent
- Action: Move block A from the table onto block B.
- Duration (recorded): 1 s
- Notes: A is a vowel block and was clear on the table; B became clear on top after Step 1. This move is permitted for the vowel agent.

Result after these steps:
- A is on B, B is on C (and the rest of the tall stack remains C on D on E on F on G on H on I on J with J on the table).
- Plan cost: 2 (unit cost).

PROBLEM
------------------------------
I am playing with a set of blocks where I need to arrange the blocks into stacks. Here are the actions I can do

Pick up a block
Unstack a block from on top of another block
Put down a block
Stack a block on top of another block

I have the following restrictions on my actions:
I can only pick up or unstack one block at a time.
I can only pick up or unstack a block if my hand is empty.
I can only pick up a block if the block is on the table and the block is clear. A block is clear if the block has no other blocks on top of it and if the block is not picked up.
I can only unstack a block from on top of another block if the block I am unstacking was really on top of the other block.
I can only unstack a block from on top of another block if the block I am unstacking is clear.
Once I pick up or unstack a block, I am holding the block.
I can only put down a block that I am holding.
I can only stack a block on top of another block if I am holding the block being stacked.
I can only stack a block on top of another block if the block onto which I am stacking the block is clear.
Once I put down or stack a block, my hand becomes empty.
Once you stack a block on top of a second block, the second block is no longer clear.

[STATEMENT]
As initial conditions I have that, the red block is clear, the yellow block is clear, the hand is empty, the red block is on top of the blue block, the yellow block is on top of the orange block, the blue block is on the table and the orange block is on the table.
My goal is to have that the orange block is on top of the red block.

My plan is as follows:

[PLAN]
unstack the yellow block from on top of the orange block
put down the yellow block
pick up the orange block
stack the orange block on top of the red block
[PLAN END]

PROBLEM
------------------------------
I am playing with a set of blocks where I need to arrange the blocks into stacks. Here are the actions I can do

Pick up a block
Unstack a block from on top of another block
Put down a block
Stack a block on top of another block

I have the following restrictions on my actions:
I can only pick up or unstack one block at a time.
I can only pick up or unstack a block if my hand is empty.
I can only pick up a block if the block is on the table and the block is clear. A block is clear if the block has no other blocks on top of it and if the block is not picked up.
I can only unstack a block from on top of another block if the block I am unstacking was really on top of the other block.
I can only unstack a block from on top of another block if the block I am unstacking is clear.
Once I pick up or unstack a block, I am holding the block.
I can only put down a block that I am holding.
I can only stack a block on top of another block if I am holding the block being stacked.
I can only stack a block on top of another block if the block onto which I am stacking the block is clear.
Once I put down or stack a block, my hand becomes empty.
Once you stack a block on top of a second block, the second block is no longer clear.

[STATEMENT]
As initial conditions I have that, the blue block is clear, the hand is empty, the blue block is on top of the orange block, the orange block is on top of the yellow block, the yellow block is on top of the red block and the red block is on the table.
My goal is to have that the red block is on top of the orange block and the yellow block is on top of the red block.

My plan is as follows:

[PLAN]
unstack the blue block from on top of the orange block
put down the blue block
unstack the orange block from on top of the yellow block
put down the orange block
unstack the yellow block from on top of the red block
stack the yellow block on top of the blue block
pick up the red block
stack the red block on top of the orange block
unstack the yellow block from on top of the blue block
stack the yellow block on top of the red block

NATURAL-PLAN sas_plan_1
------------------------------
1) Time 0 → 1 (duration 1 time unit)
   Action: vowel_agent picks up block A from the table.
   - Corresponds to PDDL action: (vowel-pickup-table A)
   - Preconditions satisfied: A is a vowel, A is on the table, A is clear, vowel_agent's hand is empty.

2) Time 1 → 2 (duration 1 time unit)
   Action: vowel_agent stacks block A onto block B (places A on top of B).
   - Corresponds to PDDL action: (vowel-stack A B)
   - Preconditions satisfied: vowel_agent is holding A, B is clear.

Final state after these steps:
- A is on B, and the rest of the initial stack relations remain (B on C, C on D, D on E, E on F, F on G, G on H, H on I, I on J, and J on the table), so the overall goal is achieved.
Total plan cost: 2 (two actions, each unit cost).

PROBLEM
------------------------------
I am playing with a set of blocks where I need to arrange the blocks into stacks. Here are the actions I can do

Pick up a block
Unstack a block from on top of another block
Put down a block
Stack a block on top of another block

I have the following restrictions on my actions:
I can only pick up or unstack one block at a time.
I can only pick up or unstack a block if my hand is empty.
I can only pick up a block if the block is on the table and the block is clear. A block is clear if the block has no other blocks on top of it and if the block is not picked up.
I can only unstack a block from on top of another block if the block I am unstacking was really on top of the other block.
I can only unstack a block from on top of another block if the block I am unstacking is clear.
Once I pick up or unstack a block, I am holding the block.
I can only put down a block that I am holding.
I can only stack a block on top of another block if I am holding the block being stacked.
I can only stack a block on top of another block if the block onto which I am stacking the block is clear.
Once I put down or stack a block, my hand becomes empty.
Once you stack a block on top of a second block, the second block is no longer clear.

[STATEMENT]
As initial conditions I have that, the yellow block is clear, the hand is empty, the red block is on top of the orange block, the orange block is on top of the blue block, the yellow block is on top of the red block and the blue block is on the table.
My goal is to have that the red block is on top of the yellow block and the yellow block is on top of the blue block.

My plan is as follows:

[PLAN]
unstack the yellow block from on top of the red block
put down the yellow block
unstack the red block from on top of the orange block
put down the red block
unstack the orange block from on top of the blue block
put down the orange block
pick up the yellow block
stack the yellow block on top of the blue block
pick up the red block
stack the red block on top of the yellow block

NATURAL-PLAN sas_plan_1
------------------------------
Summary: total cost = 2 (each action unit cost). The vowel_agent performs two actions, one after the other.

Step 1 — t = 0.0 → 1.0 (duration 1.0)
Action (PDDL): (vowel_pickup_from_table a)
Human-readable: Vowel agent picks up block A from the table.
Notes/effects:
- Precondition satisfied: A is a vowel block, A is on the table, A is clear, and the vowel agent’s hand is empty.
- Result: A is removed from the table and held by the vowel_agent. (A is no longer on the table and is not clear; vowel agent’s hand is no longer empty.)

Step 2 — t = 1.0 → 2.0 (duration 1.0)
Action (PDDL): (vowel_stack a b)
Human-readable: Vowel agent places block A on top of block B (stacks A onto B).
Notes/effects:
- Precondition satisfied: vowel_agent is holding A and B is clear.
- Result: A is now on B; A is clear; B is no longer clear; vowel agent’s hand becomes empty.

Final state (after step 2):
- on A B
- on B C
- on C D
- on D E
- ontable E

Goal achieved: A on B, B on C, C on D, D on E, E on the table.

PROBLEM
------------------------------
I am playing with a set of blocks where I need to arrange the blocks into stacks. Here are the actions I can do

Pick up a block
Unstack a block from on top of another block
Put down a block
Stack a block on top of another block

I have the following restrictions on my actions:
I can only pick up or unstack one block at a time.
I can only pick up or unstack a block if my hand is empty.
I can only pick up a block if the block is on the table and the block is clear. A block is clear if the block has no other blocks on top of it and if the block is not picked up.
I can only unstack a block from on top of another block if the block I am unstacking was really on top of the other block.
I can only unstack a block from on top of another block if the block I am unstacking is clear.
Once I pick up or unstack a block, I am holding the block.
I can only put down a block that I am holding.
I can only stack a block on top of another block if I am holding the block being stacked.
I can only stack a block on top of another block if the block onto which I am stacking the block is clear.
Once I put down or stack a block, my hand becomes empty.
Once you stack a block on top of a second block, the second block is no longer clear.

[STATEMENT]
As initial conditions I have that, the orange block is clear, the yellow block is clear, the hand is empty, the blue block is on top of the red block, the orange block is on top of the blue block, the red block is on the table and the yellow block is on the table.
My goal is to have that the blue block is on top of the red block and the yellow block is on top of the orange block.

My plan is as follows:

[PLAN]
pick up the yellow block
stack the yellow block on top of the orange block
[PLAN END]

[STATEMENT]
As initial conditions I have that, the yellow block is clear, the hand is empty, the red block is on top of the orange block, the orange block is on top of the blue block, the yellow block is on top of the red block and the blue block is on the table.

NATURAL-PLAN sas_plan_2
------------------------------
Summary: execute the two actions in the plan using the vowel_agent to build the final stack A on B on C ... J. Total (unit) cost = 2.

Step 1 — 0.0 to 1.0 (duration 1.0)
- Action: vowel_agent picks up block A from the table.
- Description: vowel_agent performs vowel_pickup_table(A).
- Preconditions satisfied: A is on the table, A is clear, and vowel_agent's hand is empty; A is a vowel block.
- Effects: vowel_agent is now holding A; A is no longer on the table and no longer clear; vowel_agent's hand is no longer empty.

Step 2 — 1.0 to 2.0 (duration 1.0)
- Action: vowel_agent stacks block A onto block B.
- Description: vowel_agent performs vowel_stack(A, B).
- Preconditions satisfied at start of the step: vowel_agent is holding A, B is clear, and A is a vowel block.
- Effects: A is now on B (on A B); A becomes clear; B is no longer clear; vowel_agent's hand becomes empty and is no longer holding A.

Result after these two steps: A is on B, and the remainder of the original stack (B on C on ... on J with J on the table) is preserved, achieving the goal stack A on B on C on D on E on F on G on H on I on J with J on the table.

Total cost: 2 (unit cost per action).

PROBLEM
------------------------------
I am playing with a set of blocks where I need to arrange the blocks into stacks. Here are the actions I can do

Pick up a block
Unstack a block from on top of another block
Put down a block
Stack a block on top of another block

I have the following restrictions on my actions:
I can only pick up or unstack one block at a time.
I can only pick up or unstack a block if my hand is empty.
I can only pick up a block if the block is on the table and the block is clear. A block is clear if the block has no other blocks on top of it and if the block is not picked up.
I can only unstack a block from on top of another block if the block I am unstacking was really on top of the other block.
I can only unstack a block from on top of another block if the block I am unstacking is clear.
Once I pick up or unstack a block, I am holding the block.
I can only put down a block that I am holding.
I can only stack a block on top of another block if I am holding the block being stacked.
I can only stack a block on top of another block if the block onto which I am stacking the block is clear.
Once I put down or stack a block, my hand becomes empty.
Once you stack a block on top of a second block, the second block is no longer clear.

[STATEMENT]
As initial conditions I have that, the yellow block is clear, the hand is empty, the red block is on top of the orange block, the orange block is on top of the blue block, the yellow block is on top of the red block and the blue block is on the table.
My goal is to have that the red block is on top of the blue block and the yellow block is on top of the orange block.

My plan is as follows:

[PLAN]
unstack the yellow block from on top of the red block
put down the yellow block
unstack the red block from on top of the orange block
stack the red block on top of the yellow block
unstack the orange block from on top of the blue block
put down the orange block
unstack the red block from on top of the yellow block
stack the red block on top of the blue block
pick up the yellow block
stack the yellow block on top of the orange block
[PLAN END]

Notes:
- All actions respect agent capabilities from the specification: vowel_agent moved only vowel-labeled blocks (A, E, I); consonant_agent moved only consonant-labeled blocks.  
- Each action respects the top-only move constraint (only unstack/pickup of top blocks, and stack/putdown onto clear locations).  
- Each listed step corresponds exactly to the action sequence in the provided plan; no actions were added or removed.

PROBLEM
------------------------------
I am playing with a set of blocks where I need to arrange the blocks into stacks. Here are the actions I can do

Pick up a block
Unstack a block from on top of another block
Put down a block
Stack a block on top of another block

I have the following restrictions on my actions:
I can only pick up or unstack one block at a time.
I can only pick up or unstack a block if my hand is empty.
I can only pick up a block if the block is on the table and the block is clear. A block is clear if the block has no other blocks on top of it and if the block is not picked up.
I can only unstack a block from on top of another block if the block I am unstacking was really on top of the other block.
I can only unstack a block from on top of another block if the block I am unstacking is clear.
Once I pick up or unstack a block, I am holding the block.
I can only put down a block that I am holding.
I can only stack a block on top of another block if I am holding the block being stacked.
I can only stack a block on top of another block if the block onto which I am stacking the block is clear.
Once I put down or stack a block, my hand becomes empty.
Once you stack a block on top of a second block, the second block is no longer clear.

[STATEMENT]
As initial conditions I have that, the red block is clear, the hand is empty, the red block is on top of the yellow block, the blue block is on top of the orange block, the yellow block is on top of the blue block and the orange block is on the table.
My goal is to have that the red block is on top of the orange block.

My plan is as follows:

[PLAN]
unstack the red block from on top of the yellow block
put down the red block
unstack the yellow block from on top of the blue block
put down the yellow block
unstack the blue block from on top of the orange block
put down the blue block
pick up the red block
stack the red block on top of the orange block
[PLAN END]

NATURAL-PLAN sas_plan_2
------------------------------
Below is a direct, human-readable translation of the given PDDL plan. Each step matches the plan exactly (no additions or deletions). I list the acting agent, the action in plain English, the blocks involved, and a timestamp/duration for each step (1.0s per step).

1) t=0.0s–1.0s — consonant_agent: Pick up B from on top of J. (consonant_agent is now holding B)
2) t=1.0s–2.0s — consonant_agent: Put down B onto C. (B is now on C; hand becomes empty)
3) t=2.0s–3.0s — consonant_agent: Unstack F from on top of E. (consonant_agent is now holding F; E becomes clear)
4) t=3.0s–4.0s — vowel_agent: Unstack E from on top of K. (vowel_agent is now holding E; K becomes clear)
5) t=4.0s–5.0s — vowel_agent: Put down E onto H. (E is now on H; vowel_agent hand empty)
6) t=5.0s–6.0s — vowel_agent: Unstack E from on top of H. (vowel_agent is now holding E; H becomes clear)
7) t=6.0s–7.0s — vowel_agent: Put down E onto F. (E is now on F; vowel_agent hand empty)
8) t=7.0s–8.0s — consonant_agent: Put down F onto G. (F is now on G; consonant_agent hand empty)
9) t=8.0s–9.0s — consonant_agent: Unstack H from on top of D. (consonant_agent is now holding H; D becomes clear)
10) t=9.0s–10.0s — consonant_agent: Put down H onto I. (H is now on I; consonant_agent hand empty)
11) t=10.0s–11.0s — consonant_agent: Unstack D from on top of C. (consonant_agent is now holding D; C becomes clear)
12) t=11.0s–12.0s — consonant_agent: Put down D onto E. (D is now on E; consonant_agent hand empty)
13) t=12.0s–13.0s — consonant_agent: Unstack H from on top of I. (consonant_agent is now holding H; I becomes clear)
14) t=13.0s–14.0s — vowel_agent: Unstack I from on top of A. (vowel_agent is now holding I; A becomes clear)
15) t=14.0s–15.0s — vowel_agent: Put down I onto J. (I is now on J; vowel_agent hand empty)
16) t=15.0s–16.0s — vowel_agent: Pick up A from on the table. (vowel_agent is now holding A)
17) t=16.0s–17.0s — vowel_agent: Put down A onto B. (A is now on B; vowel_agent hand empty)
18) t=17.0s–18.0s — consonant_agent: Put down H onto I. (H is now on I; consonant_agent hand empty)
19) t=18.0s–19.0s — vowel_agent: Unstack I from on top of J. (vowel_agent is now holding I; J becomes clear)
20) t=19.0s–20.0s — vowel_agent: Put down I onto J. (I is placed back on J; vowel_agent hand empty)
21) t=20.0s–21.0s — consonant_agent: Pick up C from on the table. (consonant_agent is now holding C)
22) t=21.0s–22.0s — consonant_agent: Put down C onto D. (C is now on D; consonant_agent hand empty)
23) t=22.0s–23.0s — consonant_agent: Pick up J from on top of G. (consonant_agent is now holding J)
24) t=23.0s–24.0s — consonant_agent: Put down J onto K. (J is now on K; consonant_agent hand empty)
25) t=24.0s–25.0s — consonant_agent: Unstack K from on top of L. (consonant_agent is now holding K; L becomes clear)
26) t=25.0s–26.0s — consonant_agent: Put down K onto L. (K is now on L; consonant_agent hand empty)
27) t=26.0s–27.0s — consonant_agent: Pick up L from on top of I. (consonant_agent is now holding L)
28) t=27.0s–28.0s — consonant_agent: Put down L onto the table. (L is now on the table; consonant_agent hand empty)

End state after step 28: the stack configuration matches the goal ordering (A on B, B on C, C on D, D on E, E on F, F on G, G on H, H on I, I on J, J on K, K on L, and L on the table). Total plan duration shown here: 28.0s (28 steps × 1.0s).

PROBLEM
------------------------------
I am playing with a set of blocks where I need to arrange the blocks into stacks. Here are the actions I can do

Pick up a block
Unstack a block from on top of another block
Put down a block
Stack a block on top of another block

I have the following restrictions on my actions:
I can only pick up or unstack one block at a time.
I can only pick up or unstack a block if my hand is empty.
I can only pick up a block if the block is on the table and the block is clear. A block is clear if the block has no other blocks on top of it and if the block is not picked up.
I can only unstack a block from on top of another block if the block I am unstacking was really on top of the other block.
I can only unstack a block from on top of another block if the block I am unstacking is clear.
Once I pick up or unstack a block, I am holding the block.
I can only put down a block that I am holding.
I can only stack a block on top of another block if I am holding the block being stacked.
I can only stack a block on top of another block if the block onto which I am stacking the block is clear.
Once I put down or stack a block, my hand becomes empty.
Once you stack a block on top of a second block, the second block is no longer clear.

[STATEMENT]
As initial conditions I have that, the red block is clear, the blue block is clear, the yellow block is clear, the hand is empty, the blue block is on top of the orange block, the red block is on the table, the orange block is on the table and the yellow block is on the table.
My goal is to have that the red block is on top of the blue block, the blue block is on top of the yellow block and the yellow block is on top of the orange block.

My plan is as follows:

[PLAN]
unstack the blue block from on top of the orange block
stack the blue block on top of the red block
pick up the yellow block
stack the yellow block on top of the orange block
unstack the blue block from on top of the red block
stack the blue block on top of the yellow block
pick up the red block
stack the red block on top of the blue block
