Summary: the plan below follows the provided action sequence exactly (22 actions). I assign each action a 1.0 time unit duration and incremental timestamps (start at t=0.0). For each step I list the action, the concrete parameters, the preconditions checked (with where they come from: initial state or earlier step), and the effects applied. The final goal (four next relations) is achieved at the end.

Final check (after t=22.0)
Goal predicates required:
- next(object_10,object_6) — added in Step 22 ✔
- next(object_11,object_9) — added in Step 14 ✔
- next(object_12,object_7) — added in Step 21 ✔
- next(object_13,object_9) — added in Step 13 ✔

Conclusion: All goal predicates are achieved by the end of the sequence. Each action in the provided plan was applicable at its application time (preconditions satisfied) and the sequence is consistent with the given initial state and action effects.
