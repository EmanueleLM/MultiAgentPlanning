NATURAL-PLAN sas_plan_2
------------------------------
Below is a clear, step-by-step human-readable rendering of the provided plan. Each step shows the bound parameters, required preconditions and which facts satisfied them (from the initial state or from effects of earlier steps), the effects produced or deleted by the step, an approximate timestamp/duration, and any verification notes. The sequence matches the plan exactly (no actions added or removed). The final goal (next object_8 object_6) is achieved at the end.

Initial facts used (from the chosen initial state):
- cats object_0, cats object_1
- collect object_6 object_2, collect object_7 object_3
- hand object_8
- next object_0 object_6, next object_1 object_6, next object_4 object_6, next object_5 object_7, next object_8 object_7
- sneeze object_4, sneeze object_5
- spring object_6, spring object_7
- stupendous object_2, stupendous object_3
- texture object_6, texture object_7

Plan (4 steps, unit cost = 4):

Step 1 — (memory object_1 object_6 object_7)
- Timestamp: 00:00:00 (duration ~1s)
- Parameters: ?o0=object_1, ?o1=object_6, ?o2=object_7
- Action preconditions (memory):
  1. cats object_1 — satisfied by initial fact (cats object_1)
  2. spring object_6 — satisfied by initial fact (spring object_6)
  3. spring object_7 — satisfied by initial fact (spring object_7)
  4. next object_1 object_6 — satisfied by initial fact (next object_1 object_6)
- Effects:
  - Adds: next object_1 object_7
  - Deletes: next object_1 object_6
- Verification notes: All preconditions are present in the initial state. After this step the state no longer has next object_1 object_6 but has next object_1 object_7.

Step 2 — (sip object_8 object_1 object_7)
- Timestamp: 00:00:01 (duration ~1s)
- Parameters: ?o0=object_8, ?o1=object_1, ?o2=object_7
- Action preconditions (sip):
  1. hand object_8 — satisfied by initial fact (hand object_8)
  2. cats object_1 — satisfied by initial fact (cats object_1)
  3. texture object_7 — satisfied by initial fact (texture object_7)
  4. next object_8 object_7 — satisfied by initial fact (next object_8 object_7)
  5. next object_1 object_7 — satisfied by effect of Step 1 (next object_1 object_7)
- Effects:
  - Adds: vase object_8 object_1
  - Deletes: next object_8 object_7
- Verification notes: All required preconditions are satisfied (some by initial facts, one by Step 1). After this step the state has vase object_8 object_1 and no longer has next object_8 object_7.

Step 3 — (memory object_1 object_7 object_6)
- Timestamp: 00:00:02 (duration ~1s)
- Parameters: ?o0=object_1, ?o1=object_7, ?o2=object_6
- Action preconditions (memory):
  1. cats object_1 — satisfied by initial fact (cats object_1)
  2. spring object_7 — satisfied by initial fact (spring object_7)
  3. spring object_6 — satisfied by initial fact (spring object_6)
  4. next object_1 object_7 — satisfied by the effect of Step 1 (and still present because Step 2 did not delete it)
- Effects:
  - Adds: next object_1 object_6
  - Deletes: next object_1 object_7
- Verification notes: Preconditions satisfied. This re-establishes next object_1 object_6 and removes next object_1 object_7.

Step 4 — (paltry object_8 object_1 object_6)
- Timestamp: 00:00:03 (duration ~1s)
- Parameters: ?o0=object_8, ?o1=object_1, ?o2=object_6
- Action preconditions (paltry):
  1. hand object_8 — satisfied by initial fact (hand object_8)
  2. cats object_1 — satisfied by initial fact (cats object_1)
  3. texture object_6 — satisfied by initial fact (texture object_6)
  4. vase object_8 object_1 — satisfied by effect of Step 2 (vase object_8 object_1)
  5. next object_1 object_6 — satisfied by effect of Step 3 (next object_1 object_6)
- Effects:
  - Adds: next object_8 object_6
  - Deletes: vase object_8 object_1
- Verification notes: All preconditions are satisfied (some originated in the initial state, some from prior steps). The action produces next object_8 object_6 and removes vase object_8 object_1.

Final state relevant facts (after Step 4):
- next object_8 object_6 — ADDED by Step 4 (this meets the planning goal)
- next object_1 object_6 — present (re-added by Step 3)
- vase object_8 object_1 — deleted by Step 4
- other initial facts unchanged unless explicitly deleted above

Conclusion
- The provided sequence of four actions exactly matches the plan and is compliant with the domain/action precondition/effect definitions and the chosen initial state.
- Every action’s preconditions are satisfied at the time it is executed (some by the initial state, some by effects of earlier actions). No missing facts or ambiguous references prevent verification.
- The final goal next object_8 object_6 is achieved at the end of Step 4 (timestamp ~00:00:03).
- Plan cost: 4 (unit cost per action).

ENVIRONMENT
------------------------------
I am playing with a set of objects. Here are the actions I can do

Paltry object_0 object_1 object_2.
Sip object_0 object_1 object_2.
Clip object_0 object_1 object_2.
Wretched object_0 object_1 object_2 object_3.
Memory object_0 object_1 object_2.
Tightfisted object_0 object_1 object_2.

I have the following restrictions on my actions:
To perform paltry action, the following facts need to be true: hand object_0, cats object_1, texture object_2, vase object_0 object_1, and next object_1 object_2
Once paltry is performed the following facts will be true: next object_0 object_2
Once paltry is performed the following facts will be false: vase object_0 object_1
To perform sip action, the following facts need to be true: hand object_0, cats object_1, texture object_2, next object_0 object_2, and next object_1 object_2
Once sip is performed the following facts will be true: vase object_0 object_1
Once sip is performed the following facts will be false: next object_0 object_2
To perform clip action, the following facts need to be true: hand object_0, sneeze object_1, texture object_2, next object_1 object_2, and next object_0 object_2
Once clip is performed the following facts will be true: vase object_0 object_1
Once clip is performed the following facts will be false: next object_0 object_2
To perform wretched action, the following facts need to be true: sneeze object_0, texture object_1, texture object_2, stupendous object_3, next object_0 object_1, collect object_1 object_3, and collect object_2 object_3
Once wretched is performed the following facts will be true: next object_0 object_2
Once wretched is performed the following facts will be false: next object_0 object_1
To perform memory action, the following facts need to be true: cats object_0, spring object_1, spring object_2, and next object_0 object_1
Once memory is performed the following facts will be true: next object_0 object_2
Once memory is performed the following facts will be false: next object_0 object_1
To perform tightfisted action, the following facts need to be true: hand object_0, sneeze object_1, texture object_2, next object_1 object_2, and vase object_0 object_1
Once tightfisted is performed the following facts will be true: next object_0 object_2

NATURAL-PLAN sas_plan_1
------------------------------
 plan step 1 — time 0.0 (duration 1.0)
 Action: sip(object_8, object_0, object_7)
 - Intuition: form a vase between object_8 and object_0 by using their common relation to object_7.
 - Preconditions checked (all true in the initial state before this step):
   • hand(object_8) — object_8 is held.
   • cats(object_0) — object_0 is a “cats” object.
   • texture(object_7) — object_7 carries the required texture.
   • next(object_8, object_7) — object_8 is next to object_7.
   • next(object_0, object_7) — object_0 is next to object_7.
 - Effects (applied at the end of this step):
   • Added: vase(object_8, object_0)
   • Removed: next(object_8, object_7)
 - State note after step 1:
   • vase(object_8, object_0) is now true.
   • next(object_8, object_7) is no longer true.
   • All other facts unchanged from the initial state.

 plan step 2 — time 1.0 (duration 1.0)
 Action: paltry(object_8, object_0, object_6)
 - Intuition: use the vase between object_8 and object_0 and the relation of object_0 to object_6 to create next(object_8, object_6).
 - Preconditions checked (all true at this time):
   • hand(object_8) — object_8 is held (still true).
   • cats(object_0) — object_0 is a “cats” object (true).
   • texture(object_6) — object_6 carries the required texture (true in initial state).
   • vase(object_8, object_0) — created by step 1 (true).
   • next(object_0, object_6) — present in the initial state (true).
 - Effects (applied at the end of this step):
   • Added: next(object_8, object_6)
   • Removed: vase(object_8, object_0)
 - State note after step 2:
   • next(object_8, object_6) is now true (this is the main achieved fact).
   • vase(object_8, object_0) has been removed.
   • next(object_7, object_6) was already true in the initial state and remains true.

 Summary / Goal verification
 - Required goals:
   • next(object_7, object_6) — already true in the initial state (no actions required).
   • next(object_8, object_6) — achieved by step 2 (paltry).
 - Final result: Both goals are satisfied. Total plan length: 2 actions; total (simulated) time: 2.0 units.

As initial conditions I have that, cats object_0, collect object_5 object_1, collect object_6 object_2, hand object_7, hand object_8, next object_0 object_6, next object_3 object_5, next object_4 object_6, next object_7 object_6, next object_8 object_6, sneeze object_3, sneeze object_4, spring object_5, spring object_6, stupendous object_1, stupendous object_2, texture object_5 and texture object_6.
My goal is to have that next object_7 object_5 and next object_8 object_5.

My plan is as follows:

NATURAL-PLAN sas_plan_1
------------------------------
Plan trace (steps follow the given plan exactly). I assign each step a 1-unit duration and sequential timestamps for clarity.

Initial relevant facts (from the problem):
- cats(object_0)
- collect(object_5,object_1)
- collect(object_6,object_2)
- hand(object_7), hand(object_8)
- next(object_0,object_6)
- next(object_3,object_5)
- next(object_4,object_6)
- next(object_7,object_6)
- next(object_8,object_5)
- sneeze(object_3), sneeze(object_4)
- spring(object_5), spring(object_6)
- stupendous(object_1), stupendous(object_2)
- texture(object_5), texture(object_6)

Goal to satisfy:
- next(object_7,object_6)
- next(object_8,object_6)

Step 1 — t = 0 → 1 (duration 1)
Action: memory(object_0, object_6, object_5)
- Intended meaning: move the "next" relation for object_0 from object_6 to object_5.
- Preconditions required:
  - cats(object_0) — present in initial state
  - spring(object_6) — present in initial state
  - spring(object_5) — present in initial state
  - next(object_0, object_6) — present in initial state
  => All preconditions satisfied.
- Effects:
  - Add: next(object_0, object_5)
  - Delete: next(object_0, object_6)
- State change summary: next(0,5) becomes true; next(0,6) becomes false.

Step 2 — t = 1 → 2 (duration 1)
Action: sip(object_8, object_0, object_5)
- Intended meaning: create vase(object_8,object_0) by consuming the next relation from object_8 to object_5.
- Preconditions required:
  - hand(object_8) — present in initial state
  - cats(object_0) — present in initial state
  - texture(object_5) — present in initial state
  - next(object_8, object_5) — present in initial state
  - next(object_0, object_5) — made true by Step 1
  => All preconditions satisfied.
- Effects:
  - Add: vase(object_8, object_0)
  - Delete: next(object_8, object_5)
- State change summary: vase(8,0) becomes true; next(8,5) becomes false.

Step 3 — t = 2 → 3 (duration 1)
Action: memory(object_0, object_5, object_6)
- Intended meaning: move the "next" relation for object_0 from object_5 back to object_6.
- Preconditions required:
  - cats(object_0) — present
  - spring(object_5) — present
  - spring(object_6) — present
  - next(object_0, object_5) — true after Step 1 and still true after Step 2
  => All preconditions satisfied.
- Effects:
  - Add: next(object_0, object_6)
  - Delete: next(object_0, object_5)
- State change summary: next(0,6) becomes true again; next(0,5) becomes false.

Step 4 — t = 3 → 4 (duration 1)
Action: paltry(object_8, object_0, object_6)
- Intended meaning: using vase(object_8,object_0) and next(object_0,object_6) produce next(object_8,object_6) and consume the vase.
- Preconditions required:
  - hand(object_8) — present
  - cats(object_0) — present
  - texture(object_6) — present in initial state
  - vase(object_8, object_0) — introduced by Step 2
  - next(object_1=object_0, object_2=object_6) i.e. next(object_0, object_6) — restored by Step 3
  => All preconditions satisfied.
- Effects:
  - Add: next(object_8, object_6)
  - Delete: vase(object_8, object_0)
- State change summary: next(8,6) becomes true; vase(8,0) removed.

Final relevant facts (after all steps)
- next(object_7, object_6) — unchanged from initial, still true
- next(object_8, object_6) — made true in Step 4
=> Both goal conditions are satisfied.

Plan cost: 4 actions (unit cost per action as given).

Notes:
- All preconditions are satisfied at the time each action is applied; no step is inapplicable.
- The plan strictly follows the given sequence and produces the required final facts.
