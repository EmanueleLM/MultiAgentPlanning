Below is a clear, step-by-step, human-readable execution trace of the provided PDDL plan. Each step lists: timestamp (start time), duration (assumed 1.0 time unit per action), the action with its arguments, the instantiated preconditions required by the action schema, and the instantiated effects that the action applies. The action schemas used are those from the specification (paltry, sip, clip, wretched, memory, tightfisted). The plan is presented exactly as given (no actions added or removed).

Legend: "pre:" = required preconditions (instantiated), "eff:" = effects applied (instantiated). Times are cumulative and start at t = 0.0s; each action is shown with duration = 1.0s.

Final note:
- The above sequence is the given plan transcribed into human-readable steps with timestamps and instantiated preconditions/effects according to the canonical action schemas from the specification.
- Each action uses the action schema preconditions and effects exactly as specified (paltry, sip, clip, wretched, memory, tightfisted).
- The plan’s final effects include (among others) the achievement of the target next relations requested in the combined goal, e.g., (next object_11 object_9), (next object_12 object_8), (next object_12 object_10), (next object_13 object_5), (next object_13 object_10), (next object_14 object_7), etc., as implied by the applied add-effects across steps.
