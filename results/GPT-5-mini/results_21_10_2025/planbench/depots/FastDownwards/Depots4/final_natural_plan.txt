Planned execution (4 steps, each step duration = 1 time unit):

1) Time 0 → 1 — memory(object_1, object_6, object_7)
   - Informal effect: move the "next" relation for object_1 from object_6 to object_7.
   - Preconditions checked (all true at start): cats(object_1), spring(object_6), spring(object_7), next(object_1, object_6)
   - Effects: add next(object_1, object_7); delete next(object_1, object_6)

2) Time 1 → 2 — sip(object_9, object_1, object_7)
   - Informal effect: create a vase relation between object_9 and object_1, consuming the next(object_9, object_7) link.
   - Preconditions (true at time 1): hand(object_9), cats(object_1), texture(object_7), next(object_9, object_7), next(object_1, object_7)
   - Effects: add vase(object_9, object_1); delete next(object_9, object_7)

3) Time 2 → 3 — memory(object_1, object_7, object_6)
   - Informal effect: move the "next" relation for object_1 from object_7 back to object_6.
   - Preconditions (true at time 2): cats(object_1), spring(object_7), spring(object_6), next(object_1, object_7)
   - Effects: add next(object_1, object_6); delete next(object_1, object_7)

4) Time 3 → 4 — paltry(object_9, object_1, object_6)
   - Informal effect: create next(object_9, object_6) by consuming vase(object_9, object_1).
   - Preconditions (true at time 3): hand(object_9), cats(object_1), texture(object_6), vase(object_9, object_1), next(object_1, object_6)
   - Effects: add next(object_9, object_6); delete vase(object_9, object_1)

Final state at time 4 (relevant facts):
 - next(object_8, object_7) — remained true throughout (initial)
 - next(object_9, object_6) — created in step 4

Goal (next object_8 object_7) and (next object_9 object_6) is satisfied at time 4.
Total actions: 4 (unit cost each), total duration: 4 time units.
