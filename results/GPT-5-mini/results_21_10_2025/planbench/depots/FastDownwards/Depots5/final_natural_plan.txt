Summary of initial relevant facts (from the problem instance)
- Unary: hand(object_9), cats(object_0), sneeze(object_3), sneeze(object_4), spring(object_5), spring(object_7), stupendous(object_1), stupendous(object_2), texture(object_5), texture(object_6), texture(object_7), texture(object_8)
- Binary: collect(object_5,object_1), collect(object_6,object_1), collect(object_7,object_2), collect(object_8,object_2)
- next relations: next(object_0,object_7), next(object_3,object_5), next(object_4,object_7), next(object_9,object_7)

Planned sequence (timestamps are illustrative, each action duration = 1 time unit):

Step 1 — t = 0.0 → 1.0
Action: clip object_9 object_4 object_7
- Parameters binding: X = object_9, Y = object_4, Z = object_7
- Preconditions checked (all satisfied in the initial state):
  - hand(object_9) — present
  - sneeze(object_4) — present
  - texture(object_7) — present
  - next(object_4,object_7) — present
  - next(object_9,object_7) — present
- Effects (applied at end of the action):
  - Add: vase(object_9,object_4)
  - Remove: next(object_9,object_7)
- State change summary after Step 1:
  - next(object_9,object_7) is deleted
  - vase(object_9,object_4) is added

Step 2 — t = 1.0 → 2.0
Action: wretched object_4 object_7 object_8 object_2
- Parameters binding: X = object_4, Y = object_7, Z = object_8, W = object_2
- Preconditions checked (all satisfied given current state after Step 1):
  - sneeze(object_4) — present
  - texture(object_7) — present
  - texture(object_8) — present
  - stupendous(object_2) — present
  - next(object_4,object_7) — present (unchanged by step 1)
  - collect(object_7,object_2) — present
  - collect(object_8,object_2) — present
- Effects (applied at end of the action):
  - Add: next(object_4,object_8)
  - Remove: next(object_4,object_7)
- State change summary after Step 2:
  - next(object_4,object_7) is deleted
  - next(object_4,object_8) is added

Step 3 — t = 2.0 → 3.0
Action: tightfisted object_9 object_4 object_8
- Parameters binding: X = object_9, Y = object_4, Z = object_8
- Preconditions checked (all satisfied given current state after Step 2):
  - hand(object_9) — present
  - sneeze(object_4) — present
  - texture(object_8) — present
  - next(object_4,object_8) — present (added by Step 2)
  - vase(object_9,object_4) — present (added by Step 1)
- Effects (applied at end of the action):
  - Add: next(object_9,object_8)
  - Remove: vase(object_9,object_4)
- State change summary after Step 3:
  - next(object_9,object_8) is added (this is the goal)
  - vase(object_9,object_4) is deleted

Final status (after all steps)
- Goal achieved: next(object_9,object_8) is true.
- Notable deleted facts: next(object_9,object_7), next(object_4,object_7), vase(object_9,object_4) (temporarily created then removed).
- Plan cost: 3 actions (unit cost each), as given.

This sequence follows exactly the provided plan (clip, wretched, tightfisted), each action’s preconditions are satisfied at execution time, and the final goal next(object_9,object_8) is reached.
