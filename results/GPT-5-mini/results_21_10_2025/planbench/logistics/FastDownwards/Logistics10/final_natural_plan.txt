Plan summary (7 steps, unit cost per action). Start time t=0, each action duration = 1 time unit.

Step 1 — t=0, duration 1
Action: wretched object_5 object_8 object_9 object_3
- Meaning: apply wretched with X=object_5, Y=object_8, Z=object_9, W=object_3.
- Preconditions checked and satisfied: sneeze(object_5), texture(object_8), texture(object_9), stupendous(object_3), next(object_5,object_8), collect(object_8,object_3), collect(object_9,object_3).
- Effects: add next(object_5,object_9); remove next(object_5,object_8).

Step 2 — t=1, duration 1
Action: clip object_11 object_5 object_9
- Meaning: apply clip with X=object_11, Y=object_5, Z=object_9.
- Preconditions checked and satisfied: hand(object_11), sneeze(object_5), texture(object_9), next(object_5,object_9) (created in Step 1), next(object_11,object_9).
- Effects: add vase(object_11,object_5); remove next(object_11,object_9).

Step 3 — t=2, duration 1
Action: wretched object_5 object_9 object_8 object_3
- Meaning: apply wretched with X=object_5, Y=object_9, Z=object_8, W=object_3.
- Preconditions checked and satisfied: sneeze(object_5), texture(object_9), texture(object_8), stupendous(object_3), next(object_5,object_9) (from Step 1), collect(object_9,object_3), collect(object_8,object_3).
- Effects: add next(object_5,object_8); remove next(object_5,object_9).

Step 4 — t=3, duration 1
Action: tightfisted object_11 object_5 object_8
- Meaning: apply tightfisted with X=object_11, Y=object_5, Z=object_8.
- Preconditions checked and satisfied: hand(object_11), sneeze(object_5), texture(object_8), next(object_5,object_8) (restored in Step 3), vase(object_11,object_5) (created in Step 2).
- Effects: add next(object_11,object_8); remove vase(object_11,object_5).
- Note: This achieves goal fact next(object_11,object_8).

Step 5 — t=4, duration 1
Action: clip object_10 object_4 object_6
- Meaning: apply clip with X=object_10, Y=object_4, Z=object_6.
- Preconditions checked and satisfied: hand(object_10), sneeze(object_4), texture(object_6), next(object_4,object_6), next(object_10,object_6).
- Effects: add vase(object_10,object_4); remove next(object_10,object_6).

Step 6 — t=5, duration 1
Action: wretched object_4 object_6 object_7 object_2
- Meaning: apply wretched with X=object_4, Y=object_6, Z=object_7, W=object_2.
- Preconditions checked and satisfied: sneeze(object_4), texture(object_6), texture(object_7), stupendous(object_2), next(object_4,object_6), collect(object_6,object_2), collect(object_7,object_2).
- Effects: add next(object_4,object_7); remove next(object_4,object_6).

Step 7 — t=6, duration 1
Action: tightfisted object_10 object_4 object_7
- Meaning: apply tightfisted with X=object_10, Y=object_4, Z=object_7.
- Preconditions checked and satisfied: hand(object_10), sneeze(object_4), texture(object_7), next(object_4,object_7) (created in Step 6), vase(object_10,object_4) (created in Step 5).
- Effects: add next(object_10,object_7); remove vase(object_10,object_4).
- Note: This achieves goal fact next(object_10,object_7).

Final verification (after t=7)
- Both goal facts are true:
  - next(object_11,object_8) — established at Step 4.
  - next(object_10,object_7) — established at Step 7.
- Plan cost: 7 (7 actions × 1 unit each).
