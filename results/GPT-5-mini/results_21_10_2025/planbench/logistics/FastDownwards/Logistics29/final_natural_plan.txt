Goal check (after last step):
Requested goal set:
- (next object_11 object_9) — established at Time 6 (Step 7) by tightfisted object_11 object_4 object_9
- (next object_12 object_8) — established at Time 21 (Step 22) by paltry object_12 object_0 object_8
- (next object_13 object_5) — established at Time 13 (Step 14) by tightfisted object_13 object_3 object_5
- (next object_14 object_7) — established at Time 18 (Step 19) by tightfisted object_14 object_3 object_7

Conclusion: The above grounded action sequence (timestamps 0..21, duration 1 each) matches the given plan exactly. The actions' preconditions and effects are shown instantiating the domain schemas; after executing the sequence the requested goal atoms are produced.
