Plan executed by agent1 (4 steps, unit cost per step). Each step lists: timestamp, action name with parameters, brief preconditions checked at that time, effects applied, and resulting relevant state changes.

Step 1 — time 0.0, duration 1.0
Action: memory_ag1(object_1, object_6, object_7) — performed by agent1
Preconditions checked (satisfied before execution): cats(object_1), spring(object_6), spring(object_7), next(object_1, object_6)
Effects applied:
- Added: next(object_1, object_7)
- Removed: next(object_1, object_6)
Resulting relevant facts after step: next(object_1, object_7) is true (next(object_1, object_6) is no longer true).

Step 2 — time 1.0, duration 1.0
Action: sip_ag1(object_9, object_1, object_7) — performed by agent1
Preconditions checked (satisfied before execution): hand(object_9), cats(object_1), texture(object_7), next(object_9, object_7), next(object_1, object_7)
Effects applied:
- Added: vase(object_9, object_1)
- Removed: next(object_9, object_7)
Resulting relevant facts after step: vase(object_9, object_1) is true; next(object_9, object_7) has been removed.

Step 3 — time 2.0, duration 1.0
Action: memory_ag1(object_1, object_7, object_6) — performed by agent1
Preconditions checked (satisfied before execution): cats(object_1), spring(object_7), spring(object_6), next(object_1, object_7)
Effects applied:
- Added: next(object_1, object_6)
- Removed: next(object_1, object_7)
Resulting relevant facts after step: next(object_1, object_6) is restored; next(object_1, object_7) removed.

Step 4 — time 3.0, duration 1.0
Action: paltry_ag1(object_9, object_1, object_6) — performed by agent1
Preconditions checked (satisfied before execution): hand(object_9), cats(object_1), texture(object_6), vase(object_9, object_1), next(object_1, object_6)
Effects applied:
- Added: next(object_9, object_6)
- Removed: vase(object_9, object_1)
Resulting relevant facts after step: next(object_9, object_6) is true; vase(object_9, object_1) removed.

Final state relevant to goal:
- next(object_8, object_7) — was true initially and remains true.
- next(object_9, object_6) — established by Step 4 and now true.

Goal achieved: (next object_8 object_7) and (next object_9 object_6).
Total steps: 4. Total (nominal) duration: 4.0 time units. Total cost: 4 (unit cost per action).
