Below is a step-by-step, human-readable rendering of the given PDDL plan. Each step lists the action with its parameters, a timestamp (assuming 1 second per action), and a short natural-language description of what the action requires and what it does (its effect), using the domain semantics.

Step 1 — t = 0s
Action: clip object_11 object_4 object_6
Description: Using object_11 (a hand) with object_4 (a sneeze) and texture object_6, perform clip. Preconditions: object_11 has hand, object_4 has sneeze, object_6 has texture, and next(object_4,object_6) and next(object_11,object_6) hold. Effect: add vase(object_11,object_4) and remove next(object_11,object_6).

Step 2 — t = 1s
Action: wretched object_4 object_6 object_8 object_2
Description: Using sneeze object_4, textures object_6 and object_8, and stupendous object_2, perform wretched. Preconditions: sneeze(object_4), texture(object_6), texture(object_8), stupendous(object_2), next(object_4,object_6), collect(object_6,object_2) and collect(object_8,object_2). Effect: add next(object_4,object_8) and remove next(object_4,object_6).

Step 3 — t = 2s
Action: clip object_10 object_4 object_8
Description: Using object_10 (a hand) with sneeze object_4 and texture object_8, perform clip. Preconditions: hand(object_10), sneeze(object_4), texture(object_8), next(object_4,object_8), next(object_10,object_8). Effect: add vase(object_10,object_4) and remove next(object_10,object_8).

Step 4 — t = 3s
Action: tightfisted object_10 object_4 object_7
Description: Using hand object_10, sneeze object_4, and texture object_7, perform tightfisted. Preconditions: hand(object_10), sneeze(object_4), texture(object_7), next(object_4,object_7), and vase(object_10,object_4). Effect: add next(object_10,object_7) and remove vase(object_10,object_4).

Step 5 — t = 4s
Action: tightfisted object_11 object_4 object_7
Description: Using hand object_11, sneeze object_4, and texture object_7, perform tightfisted. Preconditions: hand(object_11), sneeze(object_4), texture(object_7), next(object_4,object_7), and vase(object_11,object_4). Effect: add next(object_11,object_7) and remove vase(object_11,object_4).

Step 6 — t = 5s
Action: sip object_9 object_0 object_5
Description: Using hand object_9 with cats object_0 and texture object_5, perform sip. Preconditions: hand(object_9), cats(object_0), texture(object_5), next(object_9,object_5), next(object_0,object_5). Effect: add vase(object_9,object_0) and remove next(object_9,object_5).

Step 7 — t = 6s
Action: memory object_0 object_8 object_7
Description: Using cats object_0 and springs object_8 and object_7, perform memory. Preconditions: cats(object_0), spring(object_8), spring(object_7), next(object_0,object_8). Effect: add next(object_0,object_7) and remove next(object_0,object_8).

Step 8 — t = 7s
Action: paltry object_9 object_0 object_7
Description: Using hand object_9, cats object_0, and texture object_7, perform paltry. Preconditions: hand(object_9), cats(object_0), texture(object_7), vase(object_9,object_0), next(object_0,object_7). Effect: add next(object_9,object_7) and remove vase(object_9,object_0).

Step 9 — t = 8s
Action: wretched object_4 object_8 object_9 object_3
Description: Using sneeze object_4, textures object_8 and object_9, and stupendous object_3, perform wretched. Preconditions: sneeze(object_4), texture(object_8), texture(object_9), stupendous(object_3), next(object_4,object_8), collect(object_8,object_3) and collect(object_9,object_3). Effect: add next(object_4,object_9) and remove next(object_4,object_8).

Step 10 — t = 9s
Action: wretched object_4 object_7 object_8 object_2
Description: Using sneeze object_4, textures object_7 and object_8, and stupendous object_2, perform wretched. Preconditions: sneeze(object_4), texture(object_7), texture(object_8), stupendous(object_2), next(object_4,object_7), collect(object_7,object_2) and collect(object_8,object_2). Effect: add next(object_4,object_8) and remove next(object_4,object_7).

Step 11 — t = 10s
Action: clip object_11 object_4 object_9
Description: Using hand object_11 with sneeze object_4 and texture object_9, perform clip. Preconditions: hand(object_11), sneeze(object_4), texture(object_9), next(object_4,object_9), next(object_11,object_9). Effect: add vase(object_11,object_4) and remove next(object_11,object_9).

Step 12 — t = 11s
Action: tightfisted object_11 object_4 object_8
Description: Using hand object_11, sneeze object_4, and texture object_8, perform tightfisted. Preconditions: hand(object_11), sneeze(object_4), texture(object_8), next(object_4,object_8), and vase(object_11,object_4). Effect: add next(object_11,object_8) and remove vase(object_11,object_4).

Final status (goal achieved)
- next(object_10,object_7) — established at Step 4.
- next(object_11,object_8) — established at Step 12.
- next(object_11,object_7) — established at Step 5.
- next(object_9,object_7) — established at Step 8.

Total plan cost: 12 (unit cost).
