Plan execution (each action assumed duration = 1 time unit). Timestamps are start times; action runs [t, t+1).

Step 0 — t=0: wretched object_4 object_7 object_8 object_2
- Preconditions checked: sneeze(object_4), texture(object_7), texture(object_8), stupendous(object_2), next(object_4,object_7), collect(object_7,object_2), collect(object_8,object_2) — all true in the initial state.
- Effects applied: add next(object_4,object_8); remove next(object_4,object_7).
- State change summary: 4's link changes from 4->7 to 4->8.

Step 1 — t=1: clip object_10 object_4 object_8
- Preconditions checked: hand(object_10), sneeze(object_4), texture(object_8), next(object_4,object_8), next(object_10,object_8).
- Effects applied: add vase(object_10,object_4); remove next(object_10,object_8).
- State change summary: 10->8 removed; vase(10,4) created.

Step 2 — t=2: wretched object_4 object_8 object_7 object_2
- Preconditions checked: sneeze(object_4), texture(object_8), texture(object_7), stupendous(object_2), next(object_4,object_8), collect(object_8,object_2), collect(object_7,object_2).
- Effects applied: add next(object_4,object_7); remove next(object_4,object_8).
- State change summary: 4's link restored from 4->8 back to 4->7.

Step 3 — t=3: tightfisted object_10 object_4 object_7
- Preconditions checked: hand(object_10), sneeze(object_4), texture(object_7), next(object_4,object_7), vase(object_10,object_4).
- Effects applied: add next(object_10,object_7); remove vase(object_10,object_4).
- State change summary: 10->7 added; vase(10,4) removed.

Step 4 — t=4: wretched object_3 object_5 object_6 object_1
- Preconditions checked: sneeze(object_3), texture(object_5), texture(object_6), stupendous(object_1), next(object_3,object_5), collect(object_5,object_1), collect(object_6,object_1).
- Effects applied: add next(object_3,object_6); remove next(object_3,object_5).
- State change summary: 3's link changes from 3->5 to 3->6.

Step 5 — t=5: clip object_11 object_3 object_6
- Preconditions checked: hand(object_11), sneeze(object_3), texture(object_6), next(object_3,object_6), next(object_11,object_6).
- Effects applied: add vase(object_11,object_3); remove next(object_11,object_6).
- State change summary: 11->6 removed; vase(11,3) created.

Step 6 — t=6: wretched object_3 object_6 object_5 object_1
- Preconditions checked: sneeze(object_3), texture(object_6), texture(object_5), stupendous(object_1), next(object_3,object_6), collect(object_6,object_1), collect(object_5,object_1).
- Effects applied: add next(object_3,object_5); remove next(object_3,object_6).
- State change summary: 3's link restored from 3->6 back to 3->5.

Step 7 — t=7: tightfisted object_11 object_3 object_5
- Preconditions checked: hand(object_11), sneeze(object_3), texture(object_5), next(object_3,object_5), vase(object_11,object_3).
- Effects applied: add next(object_11,object_5); remove vase(object_11,object_3).
- State change summary: 11->5 added; vase(11,3) removed.

Step 8 — t=8: sip object_9 object_0 object_5
- Preconditions checked: hand(object_9), cats(object_0), texture(object_5), next(object_9,object_5), next(object_0,object_5).
- Effects applied: add vase(object_9,object_0); remove next(object_9,object_5).
- State change summary: 9->5 removed; vase(9,0) created.

Step 9 — t=9: sip object_11 object_0 object_5
- Preconditions checked: hand(object_11), cats(object_0), texture(object_5), next(object_11,object_5), next(object_0,object_5).
- Effects applied: add vase(object_11,object_0); remove next(object_11,object_5).
- State change summary: 11->5 removed; vase(11,0) created.

Step 10 — t=10: memory object_0 object_5 object_7
- Preconditions checked: cats(object_0), spring(object_5), spring(object_7), next(object_0,object_5).
- Effects applied: add next(object_0,object_7); remove next(object_0,object_5).
- State change summary: 0's link changes from 0->5 to 0->7.

Step 11 — t=11: paltry object_9 object_0 object_7
- Preconditions checked: hand(object_9), cats(object_0), texture(object_7), vase(object_9,object_0), next(object_0,object_7).
- Effects applied: add next(object_9,object_7); remove vase(object_9,object_0).
- State change summary: 9->7 added; vase(9,0) removed.

Step 12 — t=12: paltry object_11 object_0 object_7
- Preconditions checked: hand(object_11), cats(object_0), texture(object_7), vase(object_11,object_0), next(object_0,object_7).
- Effects applied: add next(object_11,object_7); remove vase(object_11,object_0).
- State change summary: 11->7 added; vase(11,0) removed.

Plan complete at t=13.
Final verification of the goal:
- next(object_10,object_7): established at Step 3 (tightfisted at t=3).
- next(object_11,object_7): established at Step 12 (paltry at t=12).
- next(object_9,object_7): established at Step 11 (paltry at t=11).

All three goal facts are true after Step 12. Plan cost = 13 time units (13 actions).
