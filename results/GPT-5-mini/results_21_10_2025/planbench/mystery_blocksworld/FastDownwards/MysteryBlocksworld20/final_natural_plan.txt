Plan execution (timestamps in integer time units; each action duration = 1 time unit). Steps follow the given plan exactly.

Step 1 — t=0, duration=1
Action: wretched(object_4, object_10, object_11, object_3)
- Preconditions checked: sneeze(object_4), texture(object_10), texture(object_11), stupendous(object_3), next(object_4, object_10), collect(object_10, object_3), collect(object_11, object_3).
- Effects: add next(object_4, object_11); delete next(object_4, object_10).
- Notes: Preconditions are satisfied by the union of initial facts. After this step, object_4 now points to object_11 instead of object_10.

Step 2 — t=1, duration=1
Action: wretched(object_4, object_7, object_10, object_2)
- Preconditions checked: sneeze(object_4), texture(object_7), texture(object_10), stupendous(object_2), next(object_4, object_7), collect(object_7, object_2), collect(object_10, object_2).
- Effects: add next(object_4, object_10); delete next(object_4, object_7).
- Notes: This re-establishes next(object_4, object_10) and removes the link from object_4 to object_7.

Step 3 — t=2, duration=1
Action: clip(object_12, object_4, object_10)
- Preconditions checked: hand(object_12), sneeze(object_4), texture(object_10), next(object_4, object_10), next(object_12, object_10).
- Effects: add vase(object_12, object_4); delete next(object_12, object_10).
- Notes: Uses the link next(object_4,object_10) created by Step 2; creates a vase relationship from object_12 to object_4 and removes the link from object_12 to object_10.

Step 4 — t=3, duration=1
Action: tightfisted(object_12, object_4, object_11)
- Preconditions checked: hand(object_12), sneeze(object_4), texture(object_11), next(object_4, object_11), vase(object_12, object_4).
- Effects: add next(object_12, object_11); delete vase(object_12, object_4).
- Notes: This produces next(object_12, object_11), satisfying the second goal component.

Step 5 — t=4, duration=1
Action: memory(object_1, object_9, object_8)
- Preconditions checked: cats(object_1), spring(object_9), spring(object_8), next(object_1, object_9).
- Effects: add next(object_1, object_8); delete next(object_1, object_9).
- Notes: Redirects object_1 from pointing at object_9 to pointing at object_8.

Step 6 — t=5, duration=1
Action: sip(object_11, object_1, object_8)
- Preconditions checked: hand(object_11), cats(object_1), texture(object_8), next(object_11, object_8), next(object_1, object_8).
- Effects: add vase(object_11, object_1); delete next(object_11, object_8).
- Notes: Creates a vase(object_11,object_1) and removes the link next(object_11,object_8).

Step 7 — t=6, duration=1
Action: memory(object_1, object_8, object_9)
- Preconditions checked: cats(object_1), spring(object_8), spring(object_9), next(object_1, object_8).
- Effects: add next(object_1, object_9); delete next(object_1, object_8).
- Notes: Restores the link next(object_1,object_9) (it was deleted in Step 5 and re-added now).

Step 8 — t=7, duration=1
Action: paltry(object_11, object_1, object_9)
- Preconditions checked: hand(object_11), cats(object_1), texture(object_9), vase(object_11, object_1), next(object_1, object_9).
- Effects: add next(object_11, object_9); delete vase(object_11, object_1).
- Notes: Produces next(object_11, object_9), satisfying the first goal component.

Final status after Step 8
- Goal facts achieved: next(object_11, object_9) (from Step 8) and next(object_12, object_11) (from Step 4).
- Plan length / cost: 8 actions (unit cost each), total cost = 8.

This sequence exactly follows the provided plan; at each step the stated preconditions are satisfied by the initial facts plus prior step effects, and the listed effects produce the two required goal facts.
