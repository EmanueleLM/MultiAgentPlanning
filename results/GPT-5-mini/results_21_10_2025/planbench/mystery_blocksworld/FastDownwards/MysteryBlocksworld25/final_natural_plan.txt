Summary: plan of 17 actions (cost = 17). I assume each action takes 1.0 time unit; timestamps are illustrative (start time t=0.0). Each step lists the action, its parameters (objects), the required preconditions at the moment of execution, and the effects (facts added and facts deleted). All actions follow the provided action schemas and the given Scenario A initial state; the sequence achieves the goal (next object_11 object_8, next object_12 object_8, next object_13 object_10) at the end.

  - Delete: (vase object_12 object_0)

Final state (relevant goal facts)
- (next object_11 object_8) — added at Step 3 and not deleted later
- (next object_12 object_8) — added at Step 17
- (next object_13 object_10) — added at Step 8

Conclusion: After executing the 17 actions in order (each shown above with preconditions checked at execution time and effects applied), the plan achieves the goal: next object_11 object_8, next object_12 object_8, and next object_13 object_10.
