Below is a clear, step-by-step human-readable trace of the provided plan. Each step is listed in order, shows a timestamp (starting at t=0.0s, +1.0s per step), an estimated duration (1.0s), the action with its concrete parameters, a short plain-English description of what the action requires (preconditions) and what it does (effects). The sequence exactly matches the given plan (no actions added or removed).

Final state / Goal check (after Step 21)
Required goal predicates:
- next object_10 object_6 — achieved by Step 21 (paltry object_10 object_1 object_6).
- next object_11 object_9 — achieved by Step 13 (tightfisted object_11 object_5 object_9).
- next object_12 object_7 — achieved by Step 20 (tightfisted object_12 object_4 object_7).
- next object_13 object_9 — achieved by Step 12 (tightfisted object_13 object_5 object_9).

All goal predicates are present after this sequence; the plan completes the requested goal.

If you want, I can also:
- Present this same trace with more detailed checks of preconditions/effects at each step (showing the evolving set of predicates), or
- Map each action to the agent (perceiver/manipulator/observer/orchestrator) if you want agent-level assignment.
