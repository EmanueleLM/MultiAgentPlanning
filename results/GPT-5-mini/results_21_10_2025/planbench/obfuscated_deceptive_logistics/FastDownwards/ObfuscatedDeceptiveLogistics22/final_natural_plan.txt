Plan (human-readable, stepwise). Each line is one action from the provided plan in order.

Final result (after last step)
- next(object_12,object_5) was created in Step 14 and remains true (goal condition).
- next(object_11,object_7) was created in Step 18 and remains true (goal condition).

Conclusion: The sequence of 18 action instances (timestamped t=1..t=18 above) follows the provided plan exactly, each step's preconditions are met either by the initial facts or by effects of earlier steps, and the final goals next(object_11,object_7) and next(object_12,object_5) are achieved.
