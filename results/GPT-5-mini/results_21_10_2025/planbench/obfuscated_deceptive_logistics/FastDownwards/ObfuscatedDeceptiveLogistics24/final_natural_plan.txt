Plan (3 steps). Timeline: step start times and durations are illustrative (each step duration = 1.0 time unit).

Step 1 — time 0.0, duration 1.0
Action: clip(object_12, object_5, object_11)
- Role mapping: hand = object_12, sneeze = object_5, texture = object_11
- Preconditions checked in the current state:
  - (hand object_12) — true in init
  - (sneeze object_5) — true in init
  - (texture object_11) — true in init
  - (next object_5 object_11) — true in init
  - (next object_12 object_11) — true in init
- Effects applied by this action:
  - Add: (vase object_12 object_5)
  - Remove: (next object_12 object_11)
- Resulting relevant facts after Step 1:
  - (vase object_12 object_5) is now true
  - (next object_12 object_11) is now false
  - (next object_5 object_11) remains true

Step 2 — time 1.0, duration 1.0
Action: wretched(object_5, object_11, object_10, object_3)
- Role mapping: sneeze = object_5, t1 = object_11, t2 = object_10, stupendous = object_3
- Preconditions checked in the current state (after Step 1):
  - (sneeze object_5) — true (init)
  - (texture object_11) — true (init)
  - (texture object_10) — true (init)
  - (stupendous object_3) — true (init)
  - (next object_5 object_11) — true (still true after Step 1)
  - (collect object_11 object_3) — true (init)
  - (collect object_10 object_3) — true (init)
- Effects applied by this action:
  - Add: (next object_5 object_10)
  - Remove: (next object_5 object_11)
- Resulting relevant facts after Step 2:
  - (next object_5 object_10) is now true
  - (next object_5 object_11) is now false

Step 3 — time 2.0, duration 1.0
Action: tightfisted(object_12, object_5, object_10)
- Role mapping: hand = object_12, sneeze = object_5, texture = object_10
- Preconditions checked in the current state (after Step 2):
  - (hand object_12) — true (init)
  - (sneeze object_5) — true (init)
  - (texture object_10) — true (init)
  - (next object_5 object_10) — true (added in Step 2)
  - (vase object_12 object_5) — true (added in Step 1)
- Effects applied by this action:
  - Add: (next object_12 object_10)
  - Remove: (vase object_12 object_5)
- Resulting relevant facts after Step 3:
  - (next object_12 object_10) is now true
  - (vase object_12 object_5) is now false

Goal check (after Step 3)
- Required goal: (next object_12 object_10) and (next object_13 object_9)
- (next object_12 object_10) — achieved by Step 3
- (next object_13 object_9) — was true in the initial state and remains true
- Conclusion: goal satisfied.

Notes:
- The sequence exactly follows the given plan: clip → wretched → tightfisted.
- Timestamps/durations are illustrative and uniform (1.0 time unit each) to show ordering and timing; all preconditions were satisfied at execution times as shown.
