Below is a clear, step-by-step human-readable trace of the exact plan given. Each step lists: (1) a timestamp (one time unit per action), (2) the grounded action and its parameters, (3) which key preconditions are used (brief), and (4) the concrete effect in plain language (what predicate is added and what predicate is removed). No actions were added or removed — the sequence is identical to the provided plan.

Timeline convention: actions are executed at integer timestamps starting at t=0; each action takes 1 time unit.

  - next(object_12, object_9) — created at t=21.
  - next(object_13, object_10) — created at t=19.

Cost: 25 actions (one per time unit). The sequence above follows the supplied plan exactly and each step description is consistent with the action preconditions and effects given in the specification.
