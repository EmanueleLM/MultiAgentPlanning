Below is a clear, step-by-step human-readable execution trace of the provided plan. Each step lists:
- a timestamp (simple integer seconds, starting at 0s),
- the exact action from the plan with its grounded (object) arguments,
- the grounded preconditions required by that action,
- the grounded add effects and delete effects,
- a short plain-language description of what the action does to the relation(s) of interest (next / vase).

The action semantics follow the public information:
- p1_wretched(?a ?b ?c ?d): requires sneeze(?a), texture(?b), texture(?c), stupendous(?d), next(?a ?b), collect(?b ?d), collect(?c ?d). Effects: add next(?a ?c), delete next(?a ?b).
- p1_clip(?a ?b ?c): requires hand(?a), sneeze(?b), texture(?c), next(?b ?c), next(?a ?c). Effects: add vase(?a ?b), delete next(?a ?c).
- p1_tightfisted(?a ?b ?c): requires hand(?a), sneeze(?b), texture(?c), next(?b ?c), vase(?a ?b). Effects: add next(?a ?c), delete vase(?a ?b).

Summary / final state highlights (relevant predicates for goal)
- next(object_12, object_10) — added at step 15
- next(object_12, object_8) — added at step 11 (still present)
- next(object_13, object_10) — added at step 14
- next(object_13, object_5) — added at step 21
- next(object_14, object_9) — was present in initial state and preserved
- next(object_14, object_7) — added at step 9
- next(object_11, object_9) — added at step 18

These satisfy the combined goal:
- (next object_12 object_10) — yes
- (next object_13 object_10) — yes
- (next object_14 object_9) — yes
- (next object_11 object_9) — yes
- (next object_12 object_8) — yes
- (next object_13 object_5) — yes
- (next object_14 object_7) — yes

Plan cost: 21 actions (unit cost each), matches the provided cost = 21.

Notes:
- Each step above corresponds exactly (in order and arguments) to one action from the supplied plan; nothing was added or removed.
- Timestamps are simple integer seconds for readability; relative ordering and timing are preserved as the plan sequence.
- Preconditions listed are the grounded predicates required by the corresponding action schema; the plan as listed provides the necessary facts at each step (either from the initial state or from earlier steps), so each step is executable in the given sequence.
- Effects focus on the predicates that change (next / vase), which are the relevant relations for the task goal.
