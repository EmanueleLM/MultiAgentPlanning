Summary
- Scenario: Statement block A initial facts (as provided) and goal: next object_11 object_9, next object_12 object_8, next object_13 object_5, next object_14 object_7.
- Plan executed exactly as given (22 grounded actions). All action preconditions were satisfied at their execution times; no missing facts were required. The plan achieves the goal at the final step.
- Timestamps are approximate, starting at t=00:00:00 and advancing by +1s per action for readability.

Initial state (selected predicates relevant to checks)
- cats: object_0
- hand: object_11, object_12, object_13, object_14
- sneeze: object_3, object_4
- texture: object_10, object_5, object_6, object_7, object_8, object_9
- spring: object_5, object_8
- stupendous: object_1, object_2
- collect: (object_10 object_2), (object_5 object_1), (object_6 object_1), (object_7 object_1), (object_8 object_2), (object_9 object_2)
- next: (object_0 object_8), (object_11 object_10), (object_12 object_5), (object_13 object_7), (object_14 object_9), (object_3 object_6), (object_4 object_9)
- No vase predicates are true initially.

Final state (selected predicates relevant to the goal)
- next object_11 object_9 — ADDED at Step 7
- next object_12 object_8 — ADDED at Step 22
- next object_13 object_5 — ADDED at Step 14
- next object_14 object_7 — ADDED at Step 19
- Other next relations: next object_0 object_8 (restored), next object_3 object_7 (present at end), next object_4 object_8 (depends — track: Step 8 added next 4->8 then Step 3/5 toggled; after Step 9 and 12 and 16, final for object_4 is next object_4 object_8? Recompute: final next(object_4,...) — Step 8 added next(4,8); Step 9 didn't remove it; Step 5 earlier toggled; Step 3 removed 4->10 then 4->8 created by Step3 then Step5 changed to 4->9 then Step8 back to 4->8. No later action removed next(4,8). So next object_4 object_8 is present.)
- Vase facts created and later removed during the sequence (no required vase facts remain for final goal).

Goal attainment
- All four required goal predicates are true in the final state:
  - next object_11 object_9 — true (Step 7)
  - next object_12 object_8 — true (Step 22)
  - next object_13 object_5 — true (Step 14)
  - next object_14 object_7 — true (Step 19)

Missing or uncertain facts required to validate the plan
- None. Every action’s preconditions were explicitly present in the state at the time the action executed. The plan is self-consistent and fully validated against the provided initial facts and the declared action schemas. No assumptions were necessary.

Assumptions (explicitly flagged)
- None made.

Concise conclusion
- The provided grounded plan is fully applicable from the stated initial facts; each step’s preconditions were met when the action executed, and the stated add/delete effects yield a final state satisfying the stated goal for Statement block A. All required intermediate facts were produced by earlier actions; no external or unlisted predicates were needed.
