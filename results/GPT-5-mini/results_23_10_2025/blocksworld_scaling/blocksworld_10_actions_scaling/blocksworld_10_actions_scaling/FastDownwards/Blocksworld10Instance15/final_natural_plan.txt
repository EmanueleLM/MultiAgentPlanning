Step 1 — t = 0.0 → 1.0 (duration 1.0)
Action: (unstack D E)
Natural language: Lift block D off block E and hold D.
Preconditions satisfied: D is on E, D is clear (nothing on D), hand is empty.
Immediate effects: D is removed from E; D is now held; E becomes clear; hand is no longer empty.

Step 2 — t = 1.0 → 2.0 (duration 1.0)
Action: (stack D B)
Natural language: Place the held block D onto block B.
Preconditions satisfied: D is being held; B is clear.
Immediate effects: D is on B; D becomes clear; the hand becomes empty; B is no longer clear.

Step 3 — t = 2.0 → 3.0 (duration 1.0)
Action: (unstack C H)
Natural language: Lift block C off block H and hold C.
Preconditions satisfied: C is on H, C is clear, hand is empty.
Immediate effects: C is removed from H; C is now held; H becomes clear; hand is no longer empty.

Step 4 — t = 3.0 → 4.0 (duration 1.0)
Action: (stack C D)
Natural language: Place the held block C onto block D.
Preconditions satisfied: C is being held; D is clear.
Immediate effects: C is on D; C becomes clear; the hand becomes empty; D is no longer clear.

Plan cost: 4 (unit cost)

Resulting final arrangement (after executing all steps)
- A is on the table
- B is on A
- D is on B
- C is on D
- E is on the table
- F is on the table
- G is on F
- H is on G

This sequence follows the given plan exactly and achieves the specified final goal.
