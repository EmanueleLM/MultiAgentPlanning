Assumption: actions are executed in the given order. I report each action with a simple timestamp (start time) and a nominal duration of 1.0s per action. After each step I list the immediate, relevant effects on blocks.

0.0s — Step 1 — (pickup-agent1 a)
- Agent: agent1
- Action: agent1 picks up block A from the table.
- Duration: 1.0s (0.0–1.0s)
- Effects / observation: A is now held by agent1; A is no longer on the table; agent1’s hand is not empty.

1.0s — Step 2 — (stack-agent1 a f)
- Agent: agent1
- Action: agent1 stacks block A onto block F (places A on top of F).
- Duration: 1.0s (1.0–2.0s)
- Effects / observation: A is on F (A → on F); F is no longer clear; agent1’s hand is empty.

2.0s — Step 3 — (unstack-agent1 g b)
- Agent: agent1
- Action: agent1 un-stacks block G from block B (picks up G from B).
- Duration: 1.0s (2.0–3.0s)
- Effects / observation: G is now held by agent1; G is no longer on B; B becomes clear; agent1’s hand is not empty.

3.0s — Step 4 — (putdown-agent1 g)
- Agent: agent1
- Action: agent1 puts block G down onto the table.
- Duration: 1.0s (3.0–4.0s)
- Effects / observation: G is on the table; G is clear; agent1’s hand is empty.

4.0s — Step 5 — (unstack-agent2 d c)
- Agent: agent2
- Action: agent2 un-stacks block D from block C (picks up D from C).
- Duration: 1.0s (4.0–5.0s)
- Effects / observation: D is now held by agent2; D is no longer on C; C becomes clear; agent2’s hand is not empty.

5.0s — Step 6 — (stack-agent2 d b)
- Agent: agent2
- Action: agent2 stacks block D onto block B (places D on top of B).
- Duration: 1.0s (5.0–6.0s)
- Effects / observation: D is on B (D → on B); B is no longer clear; agent2’s hand is empty.

6.0s — Step 7 — (unstack-agent1 a f)
- Agent: agent1
- Action: agent1 un-stacks block A from block F (picks up A from F).
- Duration: 1.0s (6.0–7.0s)
- Effects / observation: A is now held by agent1; A is no longer on F; F becomes clear; agent1’s hand is not empty.

7.0s — Step 8 — (putdown-agent1 a)
- Agent: agent1
- Action: agent1 puts block A down onto the table.
- Duration: 1.0s (7.0–8.0s)
- Effects / observation: A is on the table and clear; agent1’s hand is empty.

8.0s — Step 9 — (unstack-agent2 f h)
- Agent: agent2
- Action: agent2 un-stacks block F from block H (picks up F from H).
- Duration: 1.0s (8.0–9.0s)
- Effects / observation: F is now held by agent2; F is no longer on H; H becomes clear; agent2’s hand is not empty.

9.0s — Step 10 — (putdown-agent2 f)
- Agent: agent2
- Action: agent2 puts block F down onto the table.
- Duration: 1.0s (9.0–10.0s)
- Effects / observation: F is on the table and clear; agent2’s hand is empty.

10.0s — Step 11 — (pickup-agent2 a)
- Agent: agent2
- Action: agent2 picks up block A from the table.
- Duration: 1.0s (10.0–11.0s)
- Effects / observation: A is now held by agent2; A is no longer on the table; agent2’s hand is not empty.

11.0s — Step 12 — (stack-agent2 a f)
- Agent: agent2
- Action: agent2 stacks block A onto block F (places A on top of F).
- Duration: 1.0s (11.0–12.0s)
- Effects / observation: A is on F (A → on F); F is no longer clear; agent2’s hand is empty.

Final arrangement (after step 12, t = 12.0s):
- A is on F.
- D is on B.
- C is on E.
- B is on the table (with D on it).
- E is on the table (with C on it).
- F is on the table (with A on it).
- G is on the table.
- H is on the table.

This final configuration satisfies the specified goal: (on A F), (on D B), (on C E), and blocks B, E, F, G, H are on the table.
