Summary: The following lists the executed actions in the given sequence, in order, matching the provided plan exactly. Each step names the action, the robot performing it (as encoded in the plan), a short natural-language description of the block movement, and an estimated timestamp and duration. Preconditions briefly noted where relevant. The final state after step10 matches the specified goal.

Start time: 00:00:00

1) step1-unstack-c-h
- Time: 00:00:00 → 00:00:10 (duration ≈ 10s)
- Actor: robot1
- Action: unstack C from H (robot1 picks up block C from on top of H).
- Effect / state change: robot1 is holding C; C is no longer on H; H becomes clear.
- Preconditions assumed: C was on H, C was clear, robot1's hand was empty, robot1 can manipulate C.

2) step2-stack-c-b
- Time: 00:00:10 → 00:00:20 (duration ≈ 10s)
- Actor: robot1
- Action: stack C onto B (robot1 places the held block C on top of B).
- Effect / state change: C is now on B; C becomes clear; B is no longer clear; robot1's hand is empty.
- Preconditions assumed: robot1 was holding C, B was clear, robot1 can manipulate C.

3) step3-unstack-a-g
- Time: 00:00:20 → 00:00:30 (duration ≈ 10s)
- Actor: robot1
- Action: unstack A from G (robot1 picks up block A from on top of G).
- Effect / state change: robot1 is holding A; A is no longer on G; G becomes clear.
- Preconditions assumed: A was on G, A was clear, robot1's hand was empty, robot1 can manipulate A.

4) step4-putdown-a
- Time: 00:00:30 → 00:00:40 (duration ≈ 10s)
- Actor: robot1
- Action: put down A on the table (robot1 places the held block A onto the table).
- Effect / state change: A is on the table and clear; robot1's hand becomes empty.
- Preconditions assumed: robot1 was holding A, robot1 can manipulate A.

5) step5-pickup-a
- Time: 00:00:40 → 00:00:50 (duration ≈ 10s)
- Actor: robot1
- Action: pickup A from the table (robot1 picks A up from the table).
- Effect / state change: robot1 is holding A; A is no longer on the table; A is not clear; robot1's hand is not empty.
- Preconditions assumed: A was on the table and clear, robot1's hand was empty, robot1 can manipulate A.

6) step6-stack-a-c
- Time: 00:00:50 → 00:01:00 (duration ≈ 10s)
- Actor: robot1
- Action: stack A onto C (robot1 places the held block A on top of C).
- Effect / state change: A is on C; A becomes clear; C is no longer clear; robot1's hand is empty.
- Preconditions assumed: robot1 was holding A, C was clear, robot1 can manipulate A.

7) step7-pickup-h
- Time: 00:01:00 → 00:01:10 (duration ≈ 10s)
- Actor: robot1
- Action: pickup H from the table (robot1 picks H up from the table).
- Effect / state change: robot1 is holding H; H is no longer on the table; H is not clear; robot1's hand is not empty.
- Preconditions assumed: H was on the table and clear, robot1's hand was empty, robot1 can manipulate H.

8) step8-putdown-h
- Time: 00:01:10 → 00:01:20 (duration ≈ 10s)
- Actor: robot1
- Action: put down H on the table (robot1 places the held block H back onto the table).
- Effect / state change: H is on the table and clear; robot1's hand becomes empty.
- Preconditions assumed: robot1 was holding H, robot1 can manipulate H.

9) step9-unstack-a-c
- Time: 00:01:20 → 00:01:30 (duration ≈ 10s)
- Actor: robot1
- Action: unstack A from C (robot1 picks up block A from on top of C).
- Effect / state change: robot1 is holding A; A is no longer on C; C becomes clear.
- Preconditions assumed: A was on C, A was clear, robot1's hand was empty, robot1 can manipulate A.

10) step10-stack-a-g
- Time: 00:01:30 → 00:01:40 (duration ≈ 10s)
- Actor: robot1
- Action: stack A onto G (robot1 places the held block A on top of G).
- Effect / state change: A is now on G; A becomes clear; G is no longer clear; robot1's hand becomes empty.
- Preconditions assumed: robot1 was holding A, G was clear, robot1 can manipulate A.

Completion:
- Final timestamp: 00:01:40
- The executed sequence reaches at-step step10, which satisfies the plan goal.
- Final block configuration (as a result of the above actions): 
  - A on G
  - B on D
  - C on B
  - D on table
  - E on table
  - F on E
  - G on F
  - H on table

Notes / assumptions:
- All actions are executed by robot1 as specified in the plan; robot2 performs no actions in this sequence.
- Estimated durations are provided for readability; actual execution times may differ.
- Preconditions listed are the expected conditions required before each action and are consistent with the initial public information and the plan ordering.
