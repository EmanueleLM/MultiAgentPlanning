Below is a human-readable, step-by-step execution of the provided plan. Each step corresponds exactly to one action in the plan (no actions added or removed). I give a simple timestamp assuming each action takes 1 second (start t=0s), a short natural-language description of the action, and the immediate effect on the blocks involved.

Timestamps use seconds (s). Total actions = 20 (cost = 20).

1) t = 0s — unstack D from A (step0 → step1)
   - Action: Pick up D from on top of A.
   - Effect: holding D; A becomes clear; D is no longer on A.

2) t = 1s — stack D onto A (step1 → step2)
   - Action: Put D back down on A.
   - Effect: D is on A; D is clear (top); hand empty; A is no longer clear.

3) t = 2s — pickup E from table (step2 → step3)
   - Action: Pick up E from the table.
   - Effect: holding E; E no longer on table; E is not clear while held.

4) t = 3s — stack E onto C (step3 → step4)
   - Action: Put E on top of C.
   - Effect: E is on C; E is clear (top); C is no longer clear; hand empty.

5) t = 4s — unstack D from A (step4 → step5)
   - Action: Pick up D from on top of A.
   - Effect: holding D; A becomes clear; D is no longer on A.

6) t = 5s — putdown D on table (step5 → step6)
   - Action: Put D down on the table.
   - Effect: D is on the table (clear); hand empty; D no longer on A.

7) t = 6s — unstack E from C (step6 → step7)
   - Action: Pick up E from on top of C.
   - Effect: holding E; C becomes clear; E is no longer on C.

8) t = 7s — stack E onto A (step7 → step8)
   - Action: Put E on top of A.
   - Effect: E is on A; E is clear (top); A is no longer clear; hand empty.

9) t = 8s — unstack C from H (step8 → step9)
   - Action: Pick up C from on top of H.
   - Effect: holding C; H becomes clear; C is no longer on H.

10) t = 9s — stack C onto J (step9 → step10)
    - Action: Put C on top of J.
    - Effect: C is on J; C is clear (top); J is no longer clear; hand empty.

11) t = 10s — unstack E from A (step10 → step11)
    - Action: Pick up E from on top of A.
    - Effect: holding E; A becomes clear; E is no longer on A.

12) t = 11s — stack E onto H (step11 → step12)
    - Action: Put E on top of H.
    - Effect: E is on H; E is clear (top); H is no longer clear; hand empty.

13) t = 12s — unstack E from H (step12 → step13)
    - Action: Pick up E from on top of H.
    - Effect: holding E; H becomes clear; E is no longer on H.

14) t = 13s — putdown E on table (step13 → step14)
    - Action: Put E down on the table.
    - Effect: E is on the table (clear); hand empty.

15) t = 14s — unstack C from J (step14 → step15)
    - Action: Pick up C from on top of J.
    - Effect: holding C; J becomes clear; C is no longer on J.

16) t = 15s — stack C onto E (step15 → step16)
    - Action: Put C on top of E (which is on the table).
    - Effect: C is on E; C is clear (top); E is no longer clear; hand empty.

17) t = 16s — pickup D from table (step16 → step17)
    - Action: Pick up D from the table.
    - Effect: holding D; D is no longer on the table.

18) t = 17s — stack D onto A (step17 → step18)
    - Action: Put D on top of A.
    - Effect: D is on A; D is clear (top); A is no longer clear; hand empty.

19) t = 18s — unstack J from F (step18 → step19)
    - Action: Pick up J from on top of F.
    - Effect: holding J; F becomes clear; J is no longer on F.

20) t = 19s — stack J onto C (step19 → step20)
    - Action: Put J on top of C.
    - Effect: J is on C; J is clear (top); C is no longer clear; hand empty.
    - Final sequencing goal reached (current step20).

Final placement of each block (final arrangement):

- A: on the table. D is on A (so A has D on it).
- D: on A.
- E: on the table. C is on E.
- C: on E. J is on C.
- J: on C (top of that stack).
- H: on the table (clear).
- I: on the table. B is on I.
- B: on I.
- G: on B.
- F: on G.

Restating final stacks from table upward:

- Stack 1 (on table): A ← D
- Stack 2 (on table): E ← C ← J
- Stack 3 (on table): H
- Stack 4 (on table): I ← B ← G ← F

(Arrows indicate "on": X ← Y means Y is on X. Tops: D, J, H, F)

Total plan cost: 20 (20 unit-cost actions).
