Execution trace (exactly following the provided plan; 4 actions, total cost = 4)

1) Time 0.0s — unstack(E, F)
   - Action: remove block E from on top of block F and hold E.
   - Typical duration: ~2.0s
   - Preconditions assumed satisfied: (on E F), (clear E), (handempty)
   - Immediate effect: holding(E); F becomes clear; E is no longer on F; hand no longer empty.

2) Time 2.0s — putdown(E)
   - Action: place the held block E onto the table.
   - Typical duration: ~1.0s
   - Preconditions: holding(E)
   - Immediate effect: (ontable E); E becomes clear; hand becomes empty; not holding(E).

3) Time 3.0s — pickup(D)
   - Action: pick up block D from the table.
   - Typical duration: ~2.0s
   - Preconditions: (ontable D), (clear D), (handempty)
   - Immediate effect: holding(D); D no longer on table; hand no longer empty; D not clear while held.

4) Time 5.0s — stack(D, F)
   - Action: place the held block D onto block F.
   - Typical duration: ~2.0s
   - Preconditions: holding(D), (clear F)
   - Immediate effect: (on D F); D becomes clear; F is no longer clear; hand becomes empty; not holding(D).

Final arrangement after these steps (matches the PDDL goal):
- A on B
- B on G
- G on C
- C on table
- H on A
- F on H
- D on F
- E on table
- Arm state: handempty

Notes:
- The sequence and actions are identical to the plan: (unstack e f), (putdown e), (pickup d), (stack d f).
- Reported timestamps are relative and illustrative (consistent ordering and non-overlap).
