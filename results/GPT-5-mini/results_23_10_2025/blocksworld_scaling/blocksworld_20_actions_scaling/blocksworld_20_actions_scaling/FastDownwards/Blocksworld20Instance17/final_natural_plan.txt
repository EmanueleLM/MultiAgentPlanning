Initial state (t=00:00:00):
- Stacks (bottom → top):
  - Left stack: A, C, E (top)
  - Right stack: F, B, H, G, D (top)
- Robot: hand empty

Plan execution (each action lasting 5 seconds unless noted):

1) t=00:00:00 — 00:00:05 — Action: unstack D from G
- Description: Pick up block D (remove D from on top of G).
- Resulting observation: holding D; G becomes clear.
- Stacks:
  - Left: A, C, E
  - Right: F, B, H, G (top)
- Robot: holding D

2) t=00:00:05 — 00:00:10 — Action: stack D onto E
- Description: Place the held block D on top of block E.
- Resulting observation: D is now on E; robot’s hand is empty; D is clear.
- Stacks:
  - Left: A, C, E, D (top)
  - Right: F, B, H, G (top)
- Robot: hand empty

3) t=00:00:10 — 00:00:15 — Action: unstack G from H
- Description: Pick up block G (remove G from on top of H).
- Resulting observation: holding G; H becomes clear.
- Stacks:
  - Left: A, C, E, D (top)
  - Right: F, B, H (top)
- Robot: holding G

4) t=00:00:15 — 00:00:20 — Action: stack G onto D
- Description: Place the held block G on top of block D.
- Resulting observation: G is now on D; robot’s hand is empty; G is clear.
- Stacks:
  - Left: A, C, E, D, G (top)
  - Right: F, B, H (top)
- Robot: hand empty

5) t=00:00:20 — 00:00:25 — Action: unstack H from B
- Description: Pick up block H (remove H from on top of B).
- Resulting observation: holding H; B becomes clear.
- Stacks:
  - Left: A, C, E, D, G (top)
  - Right: F, B (top)
- Robot: holding H

6) t=00:00:25 — 00:00:30 — Action: stack H onto G
- Description: Place the held block H on top of block G.
- Resulting observation: H is now on G; robot’s hand is empty; H is clear.
- Stacks:
  - Left: A, C, E, D, G, H (top)
  - Right: F, B (top)
- Robot: hand empty

7) t=00:00:30 — 00:00:35 — Action: unstack B from F
- Description: Pick up block B (remove B from on top of F).
- Resulting observation: holding B; F becomes clear.
- Stacks:
  - Left: A, C, E, D, G, H (top)
  - Right: F (top)
- Robot: holding B

8) t=00:00:35 — 00:00:40 — Action: putdown B
- Description: Put the held block B down onto the table (B becomes a table stack).
- Resulting observation: B on table and clear; robot’s hand is empty.
- Stacks:
  - Left: A, C, E, D, G, H (top)
  - Right: F (on table)
  - New stack: B (on table, top)
- Robot: hand empty

9) t=00:00:40 — 00:00:45 — Action: pickup F
- Description: Pick up block F from the table.
- Resulting observation: holding F; the table position under F is now clear (F removed from table).
- Stacks:
  - Left: A, C, E, D, G, H (top)
  - Table: B (on table)
  - F is held
- Robot: holding F

10) t=00:00:45 — 00:00:50 — Action: stack F onto B
- Description: Place the held block F on top of block B.
- Resulting observation: F is now on B; robot’s hand is empty.
- Final stacks (bottom → top):
  - Left stack: A, C, E, D, G, H (top)
  - Right stack: B, F (top)
- Robot: hand empty

Final check (t=00:00:50):
- Goal satisfied: 
  - Left final stack: A on table, C on A, E on C, D on E, G on D, H on G.
  - Right final stack: B on table, F on B.
- All actions match the provided plan exactly (10 actions).
