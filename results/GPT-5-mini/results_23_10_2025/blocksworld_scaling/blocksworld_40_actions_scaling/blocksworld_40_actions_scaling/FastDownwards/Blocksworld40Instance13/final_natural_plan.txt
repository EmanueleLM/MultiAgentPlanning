Execution report (actions in order, timestamps and local observations)

Start time: 00:00:00. All agents hand empty. Initial stacks (relevant):  
- Stack1: A (table) <- I <- D <- E (top)  
- Stack2: G (table) <- H <- J <- B (top)  
- Singletons: C (on table), F (on table)

1) 00:00:00 → 00:00:10 (duration 10s) — robot2: pickup C (from table)  
- Result: robot2 is now holding C. C is removed from the table and is not clear while held.  
- Local observation: C no longer on table; F and other stacks unchanged.  
- robot2 hand: holding C.

2) 00:00:10 → 00:00:20 (duration 10s) — orchestrator: unstack E from D  
- Result: orchestrator is now holding E. D becomes clear (E removed).  
- Local observation: E removed from on(D); D is clear; stack1 temporarily A <- I <- D (top is D).  
- orchestrator hand: holding E.

3) 00:00:20 → 00:00:30 (duration 10s) — robot1: unstack D from I  
- Result: robot1 is now holding D. I becomes clear (D removed).  
- Local observation: stack1 now A <- I (top I); D held by robot1; E held by orchestrator.  
- robot1 hand: holding D.

4) 00:00:30 → 00:00:40 (duration 10s) — robot2: stack C onto F  
- Result: C is placed on F. C is now on F and is clear; F is no longer clear.  
- Local observation: stack with F now F (table) <- C (top). robot2 is now hand empty.  
- robot2 hand: empty.

5) 00:00:40 → 00:00:50 (duration 10s) — orchestrator: stack E onto I  
- Result: E is placed on I. E is now on I and is clear; I is no longer clear.  
- Local observation: stack1 now A (table) <- I <- E (top held previously by orchestrator). orchestrator is now hand empty.  
- orchestrator hand: empty.

6) 00:00:50 → 00:01:00 (duration 10s) — robot1: stack D onto E  
- Result: D is placed on E. D is now on E and is clear; E is no longer clear. robot1 is now hand empty.  
- Local observation: stack1 completed as A (table) <- I <- E <- D (top).  
- robot1 hand: empty.

Summary / Final configuration (after all 6 actions):
- Stack 1: A (on table), I on A, E on I, D on E (top).  
- Stack 2: G (on table), H on G, J on H, B on J (top).  
- Stack 3: F (on table), C on F (top).  
- All agents (robot1, robot2, orchestrator) are handempty.

No illegal actions or failures occurred; every action's preconditions were satisfied at execution time. The final arrangement matches the specified target.
