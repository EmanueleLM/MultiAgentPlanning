   Effects (after): L is being held; E becomes clear; L is no longer on E; hand is not empty.

4) t=3.0s → 4.0s (duration 1.0s)
   Action: (putdown l)
   Human: Put down L onto the table.
   Preconditions (before): L is held.
   Effects (after): L is on the table; L is clear; hand becomes empty; L is no longer held.

5) t=4.0s → 5.0s (duration 1.0s)
   Action: (unstack a b)
   Human: Unstack A from B — pick up block A from the top of block B.
   Preconditions (before): A is on B, A is clear, hand is empty.
   Effects (after): A is being held; B becomes clear; A is no longer on B; hand is not empty.

6) t=5.0s → 6.0s (duration 1.0s)
   Action: (putdown a)
   Human: Put down A onto the table.
   Preconditions (before): A is held.
   Effects (after): A is on the table; A is clear; hand becomes empty; A is no longer held.

7) t=6.0s → 7.0s (duration 1.0s)
   Action: (pickup b)
   Human: Pick up B from the table.
   Preconditions (before): B is on the table and clear; hand is empty.
   Effects (after): B is being held; B is no longer on the table; B is not clear while held; hand is not empty.

8) t=7.0s → 8.0s (duration 1.0s)
   Action: (stack b c)
   Human: Stack B onto C — put the held block B down on top of block C.
   Preconditions (before): B is held, C is clear.
   Effects (after): B is on C; B is clear (top); C is no longer clear; hand becomes empty; B is no longer held.

9) t=8.0s → 9.0s (duration 1.0s)
   Action: (pickup a)
   Human: Pick up A from the table.
   Preconditions (before): A is on the table and clear; hand is empty.
   Effects (after): A is being held; A is no longer on the table; A is not clear while held; hand is not empty.

10) t=9.0s → 10.0s (duration 1.0s)
    Action: (stack a b)
    Human: Stack A onto B — put the held block A down on top of block B (which is on C).
    Preconditions (before): A is held, B is clear.
    Effects (after): A is on B; A is clear; B is no longer clear; hand becomes empty; A is no longer held.
    (After this: A on B on C; C remains on the table.)

11) t=10.0s → 11.0s (duration 1.0s)
    Action: (pickup l)
    Human: Pick up L from the table.
    Preconditions (before): L is on the table and clear; hand is empty.
    Effects (after): L is being held; L is no longer on the table; L is not clear while held; hand is not empty.

12) t=11.0s → 12.0s (duration 1.0s)
    Action: (stack l a)
    Human: Stack L onto A — put the held block L down on top of block A.
    Preconditions (before): L is held, A is clear.
    Effects (after): L is on A; L is clear; A is no longer clear; hand becomes empty; L is no longer held.
    (After this: L on A on B on C on table — the final leftmost stack.)

13) t=12.0s → 13.0s (duration 1.0s)
    Action: (verify-final)
    Human: Execute verification — confirm the final arrangement matches the target specification.
    Preconditions (before): The following must hold:
       - L on A, A on B, B on C, and C on the table
       - D on F, F on H, H on J, and J on the table
       - E on I, I on G, and G on the table
       - K on the table
       - top blocks (L, D, E, K) are clear
       - hand is empty
    Effects (after): The problem is verified (verification flag set).

Notes:
- Each action above corresponds exactly to one step in the provided plan; no steps were added or removed.
- I used a 1.0 second nominal duration per action and simple timestamps to show progression; actual execution times may vary.
- Final state after step 12 satisfies the verify-final preconditions, so step 13 succeeds and marks the instance verified.
