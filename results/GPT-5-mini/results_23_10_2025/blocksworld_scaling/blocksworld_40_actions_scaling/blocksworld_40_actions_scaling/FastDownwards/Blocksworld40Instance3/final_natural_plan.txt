Below is a clear, human-readable playback of the 20-step plan, preserving every action in the given order. I include an estimated duration and timestamp for each step (assumed duration = 5 s per action), and I indicate which agent is responsible for each action based on the agents' private responsibilities (agent_one: A,B,C,D,E; agent_two: F,G,H,I).

Start time: 00:00:00. Each step duration: 5 s. Total duration: 100 s (01:40).

1) 00:00:00 → 00:00:05 — unstack A from C (agent_one)
   - Lift A off of C. A is now held; C becomes clear.

2) 00:00:05 → 00:00:10 — putdown A (agent_one)
   - Put A down onto the table. A is on the table and clear; hand is free.

3) 00:00:10 → 00:00:15 — unstack C from E (agent_one)
   - Lift C off of E. C is now held; E becomes clear.

4) 00:00:15 → 00:00:20 — putdown C (agent_one)
   - Put C down onto the table. C is on the table and clear; hand is free.

5) 00:00:20 → 00:00:25 — unstack E from B (agent_one)
   - Lift E off of B. E is now held; B becomes clear.

6) 00:00:25 → 00:00:30 — putdown E (agent_one)
   - Put E down onto the table. E is on the table and clear; hand is free.

7) 00:00:30 → 00:00:35 — pickup A (agent_one)
   - Pick up A from the table. A is now held.

8) 00:00:35 → 00:00:40 — stack A onto C (agent_one)
   - Place (stack) held A on top of C. A is on C; A is clear; hand becomes free.

9) 00:00:40 → 00:00:45 — unstack B from F (agent_one)
   - Lift B off of F. B is now held; F becomes clear.

10) 00:00:45 → 00:00:50 — putdown B (agent_one)
    - Put B down onto the table. B is on the table and clear; hand is free.

11) 00:00:50 → 00:00:55 — pickup F (agent_two)
    - Pick up F from the table (agent_two). F is now held.

12) 00:00:55 → 00:01:00 — stack F onto G (agent_two)
    - Place (stack) held F on top of G. F is on G; F is clear; hand becomes free.

13) 00:01:00 → 00:01:05 — pickup B (agent_one)
    - Pick up B from the table. B is now held.

14) 00:01:05 → 00:01:10 — stack B onto F (agent_one)
    - Place (stack) held B on top of F (which is on G). B is on F; B is clear; hand becomes free.

15) 00:01:10 → 00:01:15 — unstack A from C (agent_one)
    - Lift A off of C. A is now held; C becomes clear.

16) 00:01:15 → 00:01:20 — putdown A (agent_one)
    - Put A down onto the table. A is on the table and clear; hand is free.

17) 00:01:20 → 00:01:25 — pickup C (agent_one)
    - Pick up C from the table. C is now held.

18) 00:01:25 → 00:01:30 — stack C onto B (agent_one)
    - Place (stack) held C on top of B. C is on B; C is clear; hand becomes free.

19) 00:01:30 → 00:01:35 — pickup A (agent_one)
    - Pick up A from the table. A is now held.

20) 00:01:35 → 00:01:40 — stack A onto C (agent_one)
    - Place (stack) held A on top of C. A is on C; A is clear; hand becomes free.

Final timestamp: 00:01:40.

Final arrangement (derived from the executed sequence):
- Tower from top to table: A on C, C on B, B on F, F on G, G on I, I on D, D on H, and H on the table.
  Expressed as relations:
  - on A C
  - on C B
  - on B F
  - on F G
  - on G I
  - on I D
  - on D H
  - ontable H
- E is on the table (ontable E).

This final arrangement matches the intended PDDL goal encoding:
(on A C) (on C B) (on B F) (on F G) (on G I) (on I D) (on D H) (ontable H) (ontable E)

Notes:
- Agent assignment: agent_one performed moves involving A, B, C, E; agent_two performed moves involving F and G as indicated above.
- Durations are estimates for readability; they show a simple, uniform timing (5 s per action) to provide timestamps.
