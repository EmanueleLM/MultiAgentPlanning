Step 0 — 00:00:00.0 (duration ~1.0s)
Action: agent1 unstack B from C.
Resulting local state:
- agent1 is holding B (holding(agent1, B)).
- C becomes clear (C has no block on top).
- The stack that was H-F-D-I-C-B now has C on top (B removed).
Notes: action respects BlocksWorld rules (only top block moved; agent1 carries one block).

Step 1 — 00:00:01.0 (duration ~1.0s)
Action: agent2 unstack G from E.
Resulting local state:
- agent2 is holding G (holding(agent2, G)).
- E becomes clear (E has no block on top).
- The stack A-E-G now has E on top (G removed).
Notes: agent2 now holding G.

Step 2 — 00:00:02.0 (duration ~1.0s)
Action: agent2 putdown G (place G onto the table).
Resulting local state:
- G is now on the table and clear (ontable(G); clear(G)).
- agent2's hand is empty (handempty(agent2)).
- The table now has a separate stack with G alone.
Notes: agent2 released G; other stacks unchanged.

Step 3 — 00:00:03.0 (duration ~1.0s)
Action: agent2 unstack E from A.
Resulting local state:
- agent2 is holding E (holding(agent2, E)).
- A becomes clear (A has no block on top).
- The A-E-G stack now has A alone on the table; E removed.
Notes: agent2 now holding E.

Step 4 — 00:00:04.0 (duration ~1.0s)
Action: agent1 stack B onto A.
Resulting local state:
- B is placed on A (on(B, A)).
- B is clear (nothing on top of B).
- A is no longer clear (A has B on top).
- agent1's hand is empty (handempty(agent1)).
Notes: This creates the A-B stack on the table.

Step 5 — 00:00:05.0 (duration ~1.0s)
Action: agent1 unstack C from I.
Resulting local state:
- agent1 is holding C (holding(agent1, C)).
- I becomes clear (I has no block on top).
- The stack H-F-D-I-C now has I on top (C removed).
Notes: agent1 now holding C.

Step 6 — 00:00:06.0 (duration ~1.0s)
Action: agent1 putdown C (place C onto the table).
Resulting local state:
- C is now on the table and clear (ontable(C); clear(C)).
- agent1's hand is empty (handempty(agent1)).
- The table gains a separate C stack.

Step 7 — 00:00:07.0 (duration ~1.0s)
Action: agent2 putdown E (place E onto the table).
Resulting local state:
- E is now on the table and clear (ontable(E); clear(E)).
- agent2's hand is empty (handempty(agent2)).
- The table now has E as its own stack.

Final check (after 00:00:08.0)
Final arrangement (as required by the goal):
- On table: A (with B on A), C, E, G, H
- on(B, A)
- The other unchanged relationships: I on D, D on F, F on H
All actions above match the provided plan exactly, respect BlocksWorld constraints (only top blocks moved; each agent carries at most one block), and produce the final arrangement required by the PDDL goal.
