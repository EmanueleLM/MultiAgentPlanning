Timeline (each action duration = 1.0 time unit):

1. [t=0.0 → 1.0] Move disk A from on top of disk B to peg middle.
2. [t=1.0 → 2.0] Move disk B from on top of disk C to peg right.
3. [t=2.0 → 3.0] Move disk A from peg middle onto disk B (on right).
4. [t=3.0 → 4.0] Move disk C from on top of disk D to peg middle.
5. [t=4.0 → 5.0] Move disk A from on top of disk B to on top of disk D.
6. [t=5.0 → 6.0] Move disk B from peg right onto disk C.
7. [t=6.0 → 7.0] Move disk A from on top of disk D onto disk B.
8. [t=7.0 → 8.0] Move disk D from peg left to peg right.
9. [t=8.0 → 9.0] Move disk A from on top of disk B to peg left.
10. [t=9.0 → 10.0] Move disk A from peg left onto disk D (on right).
11. [t=10.0 → 11.0] Move disk B from on top of disk C to peg left.
12. [t=11.0 → 12.0] Move disk A from on top of disk D onto disk B.
13. [t=12.0 → 13.0] Move disk C from peg middle onto disk D.
14. [t=13.0 → 14.0] Move disk A from on top of disk B to peg middle.
15. [t=14.0 → 15.0] Move disk B from peg left onto disk C.
16. [t=15.0 → 16.0] Move disk A from peg middle onto disk B.

Result after step 16: Right peg holds the full tower A (top) on B on C on D (bottom). Other pegs are empty. Total cost (steps) = 16.
