Initial state (t=00:00:00.000):
- Left peg: A, B, C, D (top -> bottom)
- Middle peg: (empty)
- Right peg: (empty)

Plan (each move duration: 1.0 s; timestamps increment by 1 second):

1) Time 00:00:00.000 — Move 1 (duration 1.0 s): Move A from left to middle.
- Resulting pegs: Left: B, C, D | Middle: A | Right: (empty)

2) Time 00:00:01.000 — Move 2 (duration 1.0 s): Move B from left to right.
- Resulting pegs: Left: C, D | Middle: A | Right: B

3) Time 00:00:02.000 — Move 3 (duration 1.0 s): Move A from middle to right.
- Resulting pegs: Left: C, D | Middle: (empty) | Right: A, B

4) Time 00:00:03.000 — Move 4 (duration 1.0 s): Move C from left to middle.
- Resulting pegs: Left: D | Middle: C | Right: A, B

5) Time 00:00:04.000 — Move 5 (duration 1.0 s): Move A from right to left.
- Resulting pegs: Left: A, D | Middle: C | Right: B

6) Time 00:00:05.000 — Move 6 (duration 1.0 s): Move B from right to middle.
- Resulting pegs: Left: A, D | Middle: B, C | Right: (empty)

7) Time 00:00:06.000 — Move 7 (duration 1.0 s): Move A from left to middle.
- Resulting pegs: Left: D | Middle: A, B, C | Right: (empty)

8) Time 00:00:07.000 — Move 8 (duration 1.0 s): Move D from left to right.
- Resulting pegs: Left: (empty) | Middle: A, B, C | Right: D

9) Time 00:00:08.000 — Move 9 (duration 1.0 s): Move A from middle to left.
- Resulting pegs: Left: A | Middle: B, C | Right: D

10) Time 00:00:09.000 — Move 10 (duration 1.0 s): Move A from left to right.
- Resulting pegs: Left: (empty) | Middle: B, C | Right: A, D

11) Time 00:00:10.000 — Move 11 (duration 1.0 s): Move B from middle to left.
- Resulting pegs: Left: B | Middle: C | Right: A, D

12) Time 00:00:11.000 — Move 12 (duration 1.0 s): Move A from right to left.
- Resulting pegs: Left: A, B | Middle: C | Right: D

13) Time 00:00:12.000 — Move 13 (duration 1.0 s): Move C from middle to right.
- Resulting pegs: Left: A, B | Middle: (empty) | Right: C, D

14) Time 00:00:13.000 — Move 14 (duration 1.0 s): Move A from left to middle.
- Resulting pegs: Left: B | Middle: A | Right: C, D

15) Time 00:00:14.000 — Move 15 (duration 1.0 s): Move B from left to right.
- Resulting pegs: Left: (empty) | Middle: A | Right: B, C, D

16) Time 00:00:15.000 — Move 16 (duration 1.0 s): Move A from middle to right.
- Resulting pegs: Left: (empty) | Middle: (empty) | Right: A, B, C, D

Final state (t=00:00:16.000):
- Left peg: (empty)
- Middle peg: (empty)
- Right peg: A, B, C, D (top -> bottom)

Goal achieved: all disks moved from left to right in correct size order. Total moves: 16; total time (assuming 1.0 s per move): 16.0 s.
