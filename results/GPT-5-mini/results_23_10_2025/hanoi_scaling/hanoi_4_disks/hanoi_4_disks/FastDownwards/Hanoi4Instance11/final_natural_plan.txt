Natural description: Move disk D (the largest) from the left peg to the right peg.
Resulting peg states:
- left: (empty)
- middle: A, B, C
- right: D

Step 9 — time=8 (duration 1)
Action: move-to-peg A from B to left
Natural description: Move disk A from disk B (on the middle peg) and place it on the left peg.
Resulting peg states:
- left: A
- middle: B, C
- right: D

Step 10 — time=9 (duration 1)
Action: move-to-disk A from left onto D
Natural description: Move disk A from the left peg and place it on top of disk D (on the right peg).
Resulting peg states:
- left: (empty)
- middle: B, C
- right: A, D

Step 11 — time=10 (duration 1)
Action: move-to-peg B from C to left
Natural description: Move disk B from disk C (on the middle peg) and place it on the left peg.
Resulting peg states:
- left: B
- middle: C
- right: A, D

Step 12 — time=11 (duration 1)
Action: move-to-disk A from D onto B
Natural description: Move disk A from disk D (on the right peg) and place it on top of disk B (on the left peg).
Resulting peg states:
- left: A, B
- middle: C
- right: D

Step 13 — time=12 (duration 1)
Action: move-to-disk C from middle onto D
Natural description: Move disk C from the middle peg and place it on top of disk D (on the right peg).
Resulting peg states:
- left: A, B
- middle: (empty)
- right: C, D

Step 14 — time=13 (duration 1)
Action: move-to-peg A from B to middle
Natural description: Move disk A from disk B (on the left peg) and place it on the middle peg.
Resulting peg states:
- left: B
- middle: A
- right: C, D

Step 15 — time=14 (duration 1)
Action: move-to-disk B from left onto C
Natural description: Move disk B from the left peg and place it on top of disk C (on the right peg).
Resulting peg states:
- left: (empty)
- middle: A
- right: B, C, D

Step 16 — time=15 (duration 1)
Action: move-to-disk A from middle onto B
Natural description: Move disk A from the middle peg and place it on top of disk B (on the right peg).
