Mapping note: disk a = A (smallest), b = B, c = C, d = D (largest). Pegs: left, middle, right. Each listed step is the corresponding plan action; each move is shown with a start time and a 1.0s duration.

1) 00.0s → 01.0s (duration 1.0s)
   Action: move-disk-to-peg a b middle
   Description: Move disk a (A) that is on top of disk b (B) and place it on the middle peg.

2) 01.0s → 02.0s (duration 1.0s)
   Action: move-disk-to-peg b c right
   Description: Move disk b (B) that is on top of disk c (C) and place it on the right peg.

3) 02.0s → 03.0s (duration 1.0s)
   Action: move-peg-to-disk a middle b
   Description: Move disk a (A) from the middle peg and place it on top of disk b (B).

4) 03.0s → 04.0s (duration 1.0s)
   Action: move-disk-to-peg c d middle
   Description: Move disk c (C) that is on top of disk d (D) and place it on the middle peg.

5) 04.0s → 05.0s (duration 1.0s)
   Action: move-disk-to-disk a b d
   Description: Move disk a (A) that is on top of disk b (B) and place it on top of disk d (D).

6) 05.0s → 06.0s (duration 1.0s)
   Action: move-peg-to-disk b right c
   Description: Move disk b (B) from the right peg and place it on top of disk c (C).

7) 06.0s → 07.0s (duration 1.0s)
   Action: move-disk-to-disk a d b
   Description: Move disk a (A) that is on top of disk d (D) and place it on top of disk b (B).

8) 07.0s → 08.0s (duration 1.0s)
   Action: move-peg-to-peg d left right
   Description: Move disk d (D) from the left peg to the right peg.

9) 08.0s → 09.0s (duration 1.0s)
   Action: move-disk-to-disk a b d
   Description: Move disk a (A) that is on top of disk b (B) and place it on top of disk d (D).

10) 09.0s → 10.0s (duration 1.0s)
    Action: move-disk-to-peg b c left
    Description: Move disk b (B) that is on top of disk c (C) and place it on the left peg.

11) 10.0s → 11.0s (duration 1.0s)
    Action: move-disk-to-disk a d b
    Description: Move disk a (A) that is on top of disk d (D) and place it on top of disk b (B).

12) 11.0s → 12.0s (duration 1.0s)
    Action: move-peg-to-disk c middle d
    Description: Move disk c (C) from the middle peg and place it on top of disk d (D).

13) 12.0s → 13.0s (duration 1.0s)
    Action: move-disk-to-peg a b middle
    Description: Move disk a (A) that is on top of disk b (B) and place it on the middle peg.

14) 13.0s → 14.0s (duration 1.0s)
    Action: move-peg-to-disk b left c
    Description: Move disk b (B) from the left peg and place it on top of disk c (C).

15) 14.0s → 15.0s (duration 1.0s)
    Action: move-peg-to-disk a middle b
    Description: Move disk a (A) from the middle peg and place it on top of disk b (B).

Final state (at 15.0s): right peg holds d (D) at base with c (C) on d, b (B) on c, a (A) on b — goal achieved. (Total cost = 15 unit moves)
