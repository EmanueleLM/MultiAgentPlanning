Plan (16 steps). Each move duration: 1 time unit. Start time = 0.

1. Time 0 → 1: Move disk a (which was on disk b) to peg middle.
2. Time 1 → 2: Move disk b (which was on disk c) to peg right.
3. Time 2 → 3: Move disk a (which was on peg middle) onto disk b.
4. Time 3 → 4: Move disk c (which was on disk d) to peg middle.
5. Time 4 → 5: Move disk a (which was on disk b) onto disk d.
6. Time 5 → 6: Move disk b (which was on peg right) onto disk c.
7. Time 6 → 7: Move disk a (which was on disk d) onto disk b.
8. Time 7 → 8: Move disk d (which was on peg left) to peg right.
9. Time 8 → 9: Move disk a (which was on disk b) to peg left.
10. Time 9 → 10: Move disk a (which was on peg left) onto disk d.
11. Time 10 → 11: Move disk b (which was on disk c) to peg left.
12. Time 11 → 12: Move disk a (which was on disk d) onto disk b.
13. Time 12 → 13: Move disk c (which was on peg middle) onto disk d.
14. Time 13 → 14: Move disk a (which was on disk b) to peg middle.
15. Time 14 → 15: Move disk b (which was on peg left) onto disk c.
16. Time 15 → 16: Move disk a (which was on peg middle) onto disk b.

Final state (at Time 16): Goal achieved — right peg has top-to-bottom a, b, c, d; left and middle pegs are empty. Total cost: 16 time units.
