Summary / assumptions:
- Disks: A (smallest), B, C, D, E (largest).
- Pegs: left, middle, right.
- Initial: all disks stacked on left peg (top→bottom A, B, C, D, E).
- Each listed move is executed sequentially; assume each move takes 1.0 s. Timestamps below use that unit.

Step-by-step execution (timestamps in seconds):

1. t=0.0–1.0s — Move disk A from on disk B to peg right.
2. t=1.0–2.0s — Move disk B from on disk C to peg middle.
3. t=2.0–3.0s — Move disk A from peg right onto disk B.
4. t=3.0–4.0s — Move disk C from on disk D to peg right.
5. t=4.0–5.0s — Move disk A from on disk B onto disk D.
6. t=5.0–6.0s — Move disk B from peg middle onto disk C.
7. t=6.0–7.0s — Move disk A from on disk D onto disk B.
8. t=7.0–8.0s — Move disk D from on disk E to peg middle.
9. t=8.0–9.0s — Move disk A from on disk B onto disk E.
10. t=9.0–10.0s — Move disk A from on disk E onto disk D.
11. t=10.0–11.0s — Move disk B from on disk C onto disk E.
12. t=11.0–12.0s — Move disk A from on disk D onto disk B.
13. t=12.0–13.0s — Move disk C from peg right onto disk D.
14. t=13.0–14.0s — Move disk A from on disk B to peg right.
15. t=14.0–15.0s — Move disk B from on disk E onto disk C.
16. t=15.0–16.0s — Move disk A from peg right onto disk B.
17. t=16.0–17.0s — Move disk E from peg left to peg right.
18. t=17.0–18.0s — Move disk A from on disk B to peg left.
19. t=18.0–19.0s — Move disk B from on disk C onto disk E.
20. t=19.0–20.0s — Move disk A from peg left onto disk B.
21. t=20.0–21.0s — Move disk C from on disk D to peg left.
22. t=21.0–22.0s — Move disk A from on disk B onto disk D.
23. t=22.0–23.0s — Move disk B from on disk E onto disk C.
24. t=23.0–24.0s — Move disk A from on disk D onto disk B.
25. t=24.0–25.0s — Move disk D from peg middle onto disk E.
26. t=25.0–26.0s — Move disk A from on disk B onto disk D.
27. t=26.0–27.0s — Move disk B from on disk C to peg middle.
28. t=27.0–28.0s — Move disk A from on disk D onto disk B.
29. t=28.0–29.0s — Move disk C from peg left onto disk D.
30. t=29.0–30.0s — Move disk A from on disk B to peg left.
31. t=30.0–31.0s — Move disk B from peg middle onto disk C.
32. t=31.0–32.0s — Move disk A from peg left onto disk B.

Total moves: 32 (unit cost each). Final state: all disks stacked on right peg in order top→bottom A, B, C, D, E — goal achieved.
