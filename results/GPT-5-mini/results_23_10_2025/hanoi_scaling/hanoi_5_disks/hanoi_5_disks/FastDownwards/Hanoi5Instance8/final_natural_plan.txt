Summary: each move below is one atomic Tower-of-Hanoi move. I list steps 1–40 in order, with a timestamp (starting at 00:00:00) and a duration of 1s per move. Disks: A (smallest) … E (largest). Pegs: left, middle, right.

1) 00:00:00 (duration 1s) — move-disk-to-peg A from on-disk B to peg middle.
2) 00:00:01 (duration 1s) — move-disk-to-peg B from on-disk C to peg right.

16) 00:00:15 (duration 1s) — move-disk-to-disk A from on-disk B onto disk E.
17) 00:00:16 (duration 1s) — move-disk-to-disk A from on-disk E onto disk D.
18) 00:00:17 (duration 1s) — move-disk-to-disk B from on-disk C onto disk E.

23) 00:00:22 (duration 1s) — move-peg-to-disk A from peg right onto disk B.
24) 00:00:23 (duration 1s) — move-peg-to-peg E from peg left to peg right.
25) 00:00:24 (duration 1s) — move-disk-to-peg A from on-disk B to peg left.
26) 00:00:25 (duration 1s) — move-disk-to-disk B from on-disk C onto disk E.
27) 00:00:26 (duration 1s) — move-peg-to-disk A from peg left onto disk B.
28) 00:00:27 (duration 1s) — move-disk-to-peg C from on-disk D to peg left.
29) 00:00:28 (duration 1s) — move-disk-to-disk A from on-disk B onto disk D.

33) 00:00:32 (duration 1s) — move-disk-to-peg A from on-disk B to peg middle.
34) 00:00:33 (duration 1s) — move-peg-to-disk A from peg middle onto disk D.
35) 00:00:34 (duration 1s) — move-disk-to-peg B from on-disk C to peg middle.
36) 00:00:35 (duration 1s) — move-disk-to-disk A from on-disk D onto disk B.
37) 00:00:36 (duration 1s) — move-peg-to-disk C from peg left onto disk D.
38) 00:00:37 (duration 1s) — move-disk-to-peg A from on-disk B to peg left.
39) 00:00:38 (duration 1s) — move-peg-to-disk B from peg middle onto disk C.
40) 00:00:39 (duration 1s) — move-peg-to-disk A from peg left onto disk B.

Result: after step 40 the full stack has been transferred to the right peg in top-to-bottom order A, B, C, D, E; left and middle pegs are empty. Total cost (moves) = 40.
