Note: Steps preserved exactly as in the provided plan, translated into explicit English descriptions: "Move disk <Disk> (source) onto <destination>". Timestamps are 1s apart for readability; treat them as simple sequence markers (each move as a single atomic step of 1 second) so you can track order and duration.
