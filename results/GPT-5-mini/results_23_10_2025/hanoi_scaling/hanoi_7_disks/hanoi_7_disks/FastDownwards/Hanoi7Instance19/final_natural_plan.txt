Below is a faithful, step-by-step, human-readable rendering of the provided PDDL plan. I translate each plan action into a clear instruction using disk names A..G (a->A, b->B, c->C, d->D, e->E, f->F, g->G) and pegs left/middle/right. Each step is numbered and given an incremental timestamp (start 00:00:00, +1s per step) to show order/duration. No actions have been added or removed; the sequence matches the plan exactly.

(End of plan; cumulative cost reported in original plan metadata: cost = 194)

Notes:
- Each line corresponds exactly to one action in the supplied plan (no actions added/removed).
- "from on top of disk X" indicates the disk was immediately above that disk; "from peg Y" indicates it was directly on that peg.
- Timestamps are incremental at 1-second intervals to indicate ordering and approximate duration; they are illustrative (the original plan did not contain timing).
- The final goal (all disks moved from left peg to right peg in the correct order) is achieved by this exact action sequence.
