Here is a human-readable translation of the PDDL plan to achieve the goal state:

1. **Timestamp 0.000:** The consonant agent removes block B from on top of block A, placing B in its hands. This action prepares block B to be placed directly on the table.

2. **Timestamp 0.001:** The consonant agent puts block B down onto the table. This ensures that blocks A and B are both on the table, achieving part of the goal state.

3. **Timestamp 0.002:** The vowel agent picks up block O from the table, getting it ready to be stacked on block B.

4. **Timestamp 0.003:** The vowel agent stacks block O on top of block B. This is a crucial move towards the final configuration where block O is on block B.

5. **Timestamp 0.004:** The consonant agent picks up block C, as it's currently on the table and needs to be placed correctly in relation to block O.

6. **Timestamp 0.005:** The consonant agent stacks block C on top of block O, thereby completing the goal configuration where block C is on top of O and O is on top of B.

Each action is carefully coordinated between the vowel agent and the consonant agent to rearrange the blocks into the required goal configuration efficiently.
