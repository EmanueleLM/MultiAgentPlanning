Step 1 — (schedule-anthony t13_30 t14_00)

- Anthony schedules the one-hour meeting with Pamela and Zachary on Monday starting at 13:30.
- Meeting duration: 1 hour, from 13:30 to 14:30 (uses the half-hour slots starting at 13:30 and 14:00).
- Effects: the meeting is marked as scheduled (start = 13:30) and the 13:30–14:30 slots are no longer free for Anthony, Pamela, or Zachary.
- This satisfies Pamela’s preference (meeting start at or before 13:30) and completes the scheduling goal.
