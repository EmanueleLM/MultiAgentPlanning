Step 1 — schedule_early(slot3, daniel, peter, ralph)
- Action performed: Schedule the 30-minute meeting in slot3.
- Day and time: Monday, 10:00–10:30 (slot1 = 09:00–09:30, slot2 = 09:30–10:00, slot3 = 10:00–10:30).
- Duration: 30 minutes.
- Participants: Daniel, Peter, Ralph.
- Why this action is valid:
  - The meeting is within work hours (09:00–17:00).
  - None of the participants are busy in slot3 (Daniel, Peter, and Ralph are all free at slot3).
  - slot3 is marked as an "early" slot and is among Daniel's preferred slots, so Daniel's preference to avoid meetings after 13:30 is respected.
  - This action sets the meeting as scheduled and marks slot3 occupied.
- Resulting state: The meeting is scheduled for Monday 10:00–10:30 with Daniel, Peter and Ralph (unscheduled → scheduled; slot3 → occupied).
- Plan cost: 1 (unit cost).
