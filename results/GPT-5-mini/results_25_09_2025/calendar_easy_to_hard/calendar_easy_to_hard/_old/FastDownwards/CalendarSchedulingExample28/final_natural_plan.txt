Step 1 — schedule_by_harold(meet1, slot-1630)
- Action: Harold schedules meeting "meet1" at slot-1630.
- Timestamp / duration: slot-1630 = 16:30 — meeting duration 30 minutes → 16:30–17:00 (within work hours).
- Attendees confirmed: Jesse, Nancy, Isabella, Harold, Linda.
- Preconditions satisfied: slot-1630 is a work slot, each attendee is available at slot-1630, and the slot was not already booked.
- Effects (resulting state):
  - meet1 is scheduled and scheduled-at meet1 slot-1630.
  - Jesse, Nancy, Isabella, Harold, and Linda are marked as attending meet1.
  - slot-1630 is now booked, and those attendees are no longer available at slot-1630.

This single action achieves the goal: the 30-minute meeting (meet1) is scheduled at the earliest feasible slot produced by the plan — 16:30–17:00 on Monday.
