1) Benjamin proposes meeting m1 at 09:00 (slot s0900).
   - Proposed slot: Monday 09:00–09:30 (30 minutes).
   - Rationale: slot is within work hours (09:00–17:00), Benjamin is free at s0900 and prefers s0900, and s0900 is not occupied.

2) Brenda proposes meeting m1 at 09:00 (slot s0900).
   - Proposed slot: Monday 09:00–09:30 (30 minutes).
   - Rationale: slot is within work hours and Brenda is free at s0900; s0900 remains not occupied.

3) Hannah proposes meeting m1 at 09:00 (slot s0900).
   - Proposed slot: Monday 09:00–09:30 (30 minutes).
   - Rationale: slot is within work hours and Hannah is free at s0900; s0900 remains not occupied.

4) Orchestrator finalizes and schedules meeting m1 at 09:00 (slot s0900).
   - Resulting scheduled meeting: m1 on Monday 09:00–09:30 (30 minutes).
   - Effects: slot s0900 becomes occupied; Benjamin, Hannah, and Brenda are marked as in-meeting for m1.
   - This satisfies the goal: a 30-minute meeting on Monday between 09:00 and 17:00 that fits all participants' schedules and preferences (Benjamin’s preferred slot s0900 is used).
