Plan (1 step) — Goal: schedule a 1-hour meeting on Monday that works for Arthur, Michael, and Samantha.

Step 1 — Schedule meeting (corresponds to schedule_arthur_michael_samantha_on_half s9_30 s10_00 t9 t10)
- Action: Schedule a 1-hour meeting starting at 9:30 and ending at 10:30 on Monday.
- Participants: Arthur, Michael, Samantha.
- Time detail: 09:30 — 10:30 (1 hour).
- Why this is valid:
  - Arthur is free at the two consecutive half-hour slots 09:30 (s9_30) and 10:00 (s10_00).
  - Samantha is free at the same two half-hour slots 09:30 and 10:00.
  - Michael is free for the hour starting at 09:00 (t9) and the hour starting at 10:00 (t10), which together cover the 09:30–10:30 interval.
- Effects (as applied by the action):
  - The meeting is marked as scheduled at 09:30 (meeting_scheduled; scheduled_at s9_30).
  - The two half-hour slots 09:30 and 10:00 become unavailable for Arthur and Samantha.
  - The hours t9 (09:00–10:00) and t10 (10:00–11:00) become unavailable for Michael.

Result: A 1-hour meeting on Monday from 09:30 to 10:30 is scheduled and fits everyone’s availability.
