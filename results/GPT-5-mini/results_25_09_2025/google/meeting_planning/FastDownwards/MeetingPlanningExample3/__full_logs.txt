PROBLEM
------------------------------
You are visiting San Francisco for the day and want to meet as many friends as possible. Solve the problem by considering various different schedules and picking the best one to optimize your goals.

Travel distances (in minutes):
Bayview to Golden Gate Park: 22.
Golden Gate Park to Bayview: 23.

CONSTRAINTS: You arrive at Bayview at 9:00AM. Barbara will be at Golden Gate Park from 8:00AM to 11:30AM. You'd like to meet Barbara for a minimum of 90 minutes.

Your response should start with 'SOLUTION:'.

NATURAL-PLAN sas_plan_5
------------------------------
1) start-meeting(barbara, barbara) at Golden Gate Park
   - Planned time window: from t82 to t171
   - Interpreting t60 = 09:00 and travel time = 22 minutes (t60 -> t82):
     - Meeting start (t82) = 09:22
     - Meeting end (t171) = 09:22 + 90 minutes = 10:52
   - Duration: 90 minutes (09:22–10:52)
   - Effect: meeting goal achieved (met)

Result: The plan marks the meeting as completed (met) by holding a 90‑minute meeting at Golden Gate Park from 09:22 to 10:52.
