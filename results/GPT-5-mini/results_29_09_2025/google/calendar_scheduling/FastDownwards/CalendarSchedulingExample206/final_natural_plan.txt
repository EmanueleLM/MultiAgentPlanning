Step 1 — schedule-at t15_30
- Action: Schedule the 30-minute meeting on Monday starting at 15:30 (ends at 16:00).
- Participants: shirley, jacob, stephen, margaret, mason.
- Why valid: every participant is available at the 15:30 slot in the provided availabilities, and Margaret’s preference of not meeting before 14:30 is respected.
- Result: the meeting is scheduled at 15:30–16:00 on Monday (unscheduled → scheduled); the listed participants are no longer free at 15:30. Goal achieved.
