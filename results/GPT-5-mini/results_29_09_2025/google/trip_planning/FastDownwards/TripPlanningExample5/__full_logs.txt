PROBLEM
------------------------------
You plan to visit 3 European cities for 12 days in total. You only take direct flights to commute between cities. You would like to visit Tallinn for 2 days. You want to meet a friend in Tallinn between day 11 and day 12. You would like to visit Seville for 7 days. You plan to stay in Munich for 5 days.

Here are the cities that have direct flights:
Seville and Munich, Munich and Tallinn.

Find a trip plan of visiting the cities for 12 days by taking direct flights to commute between them.
