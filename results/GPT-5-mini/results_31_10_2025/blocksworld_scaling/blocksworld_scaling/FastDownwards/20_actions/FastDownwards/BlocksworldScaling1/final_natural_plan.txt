Below is a human-readable, step-by-step replay of the provided PDDL plan. Each line corresponds exactly to one action in the plan (no actions added or removed). I report the acting agent, the block moved, its source, and its destination. Timestamps are shown in seconds (one action per second) to give a simple duration estimate; each step is atomic (pick+place in one action) per the specification.
