Below is a human-readable, step-by-step trace of the plan (38 actions). Each step lists a timestamp (assumed 1 time unit per action), the agent performing the action, and the exact move as given in the plan.

Assumption about timestamps: actions are listed sequentially with timestamps t=0, t=1, ... t=37 (each action duration = 1 time unit).  
Assumption about self-target moves (from == to or x moved onto x): I treat these as literal actions from the plan (planner-internal re-grasps / no-op stack modifications). They are reported exactly as given.

Step-by-step trace:
1. t=0.0 — consonant_agent: move(h from c to h)
2. t=1.0 — consonant_agent: move(c from k to c)
3. t=2.0 — consonant_agent: move(j from l to k)
4. t=3.0 — consonant_agent: move(l from g to l)
5. t=4.0 — consonant_agent: move(g from m to h)
6. t=5.0 — consonant_agent: move(f from table to g)    (consonant-move-table-to-block f g)
7. t=6.0 — consonant_agent: move(j from k to j)
8. t=7.0 — consonant_agent: move(k from e to l)
9. t=8.0 — consonant_agent: move(j from j to k)
10. t=9.0 — consonant_agent: move(m from n to m)
11. t=10.0 — consonant_agent: move(n from b to n)
12. t=11.0 — consonant_agent: move(b from i to c)
13. t=12.0 — vowel_agent: move(a from table to b)      (vowel-move-table-to-block a b)
14. t=13.0 — vowel_agent: move(i from d to j)
15. t=14.0 — consonant_agent: move(d from a to e)
16. t=15.0 — consonant_agent: move(n from n to table)  (consonant-move-block-to-table n n)
17. t=16.0 — consonant_agent: move(m from m to n)
18. t=17.0 — vowel_agent: move(a from b to a)
19. t=18.0 — consonant_agent: move(b from c to b)
20. t=19.0 — vowel_agent: move(a from a to b)
21. t=20.0 — consonant_agent: move(c from c to d)
22. t=21.0 — vowel_agent: move(a from b to a)
23. t=22.0 — consonant_agent: move(b from b to c)
24. t=23.0 — vowel_agent: move(a from a to b)
25. t=24.0 — vowel_agent: move(i from j to i)
26. t=25.0 — consonant_agent: move(j from k to j)
27. t=26.0 — consonant_agent: move(k from l to k)
28. t=27.0 — consonant_agent: move(l from l to m)
29. t=28.0 — consonant_agent: move(k from k to l)
30. t=29.0 — consonant_agent: move(j from j to k)
31. t=30.0 — vowel_agent: move(i from i to j)
32. t=31.0 — consonant_agent: move(f from g to f)
33. t=32.0 — consonant_agent: move(g from h to g)
34. t=33.0 — consonant_agent: move(f from f to g)
35. t=34.0 — consonant_agent: move(h from h to i)
36. t=35.0 — consonant_agent: move(f from g to f)
37. t=36.0 — consonant_agent: move(g from g to h)
38. t=37.0 — consonant_agent: move(f from f to g)

Final status (as intended by the plan): the global stacking goal is achieved —
A on B, B on C, C on D, D on E, E on F, F on G, G on H, H on I, I on J, J on K, K on L, L on M, M on N, and N on the table.

Notes / clarifications:
- Each "consonant-..." action was executed by the consonant_agent; each "vowel-..." action was executed by the vowel_agent. This respects the agents' label-based move permissions.
- Where a move lists the source and destination as the same block (e.g., move(j from j to k) or move(n from n to table)), I preserved the planner's literal actions. These can be interpreted as planner/internal re-grasp or no-op stacking steps required by the plan. If you want each such step re-interpreted (e.g., consolidated or removed as real no-ops), indicate that and I will produce a cleaned, minimized human plan.
