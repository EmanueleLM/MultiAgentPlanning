Below is a human-readable, step-by-step rendering of the provided PDDL plan. I list each action in order, assign it to the responsible agent (consonant_agent or vowel_agent), and give a simple timestamp (one-second increments) and a short duration estimate for each step.

Step 1 — t=00:00:01 (duration ≈1s)

Final state confirmation:
- After these 30 actions (cost = 30), the goal configuration is achieved: a single tower with K on the table and, from bottom to top, K, J, I, H, G, F, E, D, C, B, A.

Notes:
- Each step above corresponds exactly to the action in the supplied PDDL plan (I did not add, remove, or reorder actions).
- Agent roles are preserved: consonant_agent performs consonant-* actions; vowel_agent performs vowel-* actions.
