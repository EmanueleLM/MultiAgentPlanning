Below are the 26 steps of the given plan, presented in human-readable form. Each step shows the original PDDL action, the agent that executes it, a plain-language description of the move, and a simple timestamp assuming each action takes 1 time unit (start..end). Agents are named per the specification: consonant_agent (moves consonant-labeled blocks) and vowel_agent (moves vowel-labeled blocks).

PDDL: (consonant-move-block-to-block h i a)
Agent: consonant_agent
Action: Move block H from on I onto block A.

Step 11 — t=10.0 → 11.0
PDDL: (vowel-move-block-to-block i e h)
Agent: vowel_agent
Action: Move block I from on E onto block H.

Step 12 — t=11.0 → 12.0
PDDL: (vowel-move-block-to-block e j f)
Agent: vowel_agent
Action: Move block E from on J onto block F.

Step 13 — t=12.0 → 13.0
PDDL: (consonant-move-block-to-place j g table)
Agent: consonant_agent
Action: Move block J from on G to the table.

Step 14 — t=13.0 → 14.0
PDDL: (vowel-move-block-to-block i h j)
Agent: vowel_agent
Action: Move block I from on H onto block J.

Step 15 — t=14.0 → 15.0
PDDL: (consonant-move-block-to-block h a i)
Agent: consonant_agent
Action: Move block H from on A onto block I.

Step 16 — t=15.0 → 16.0
PDDL: (consonant-move-place-to-block g table h)
Agent: consonant_agent
Action: Move block G from the table onto block H.

Step 17 — t=16.0 → 17.0
PDDL: (vowel-move-block-to-block e f a)
Agent: vowel_agent
Action: Move block E from on F onto block A.

Step 18 — t=17.0 → 18.0
PDDL: (consonant-move-place-to-block f table g)
Agent: consonant_agent
Action: Move block F from the table onto block G.

Step 19 — t=18.0 → 19.0
PDDL: (vowel-move-block-to-block e a f)
Agent: vowel_agent
Action: Move block E from on A onto block F.

Step 20 — t=19.0 → 20.0
PDDL: (vowel-move-block-to-place a b table)
Agent: vowel_agent
Action: Move block A from on B to the table.

Step 21 — t=20.0 → 21.0
PDDL: (consonant-move-block-to-place b c table)
Agent: consonant_agent

Summary
- All 26 actions are listed exactly in the same order as the provided plan.
- Each step shows the executing agent and the move (source → destination).
- Assuming each action costs 1 time unit, the final action completes at t = 26.0.
- Plan cost: 26 (unit cost). Goal configuration is reached at the end of step 26.
