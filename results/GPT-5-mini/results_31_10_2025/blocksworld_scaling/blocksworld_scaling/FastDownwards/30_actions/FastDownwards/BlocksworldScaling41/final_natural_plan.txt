Below is a human-readable, step-by-step rendering of the PDDL plan. Each step matches exactly one action from the plan (same order, same parameters). I list the performing agent (Consonant agent or Vowel agent), a short natural-language description of the move, and a timestamp (starting at 00:00:01 and advancing by 1 second per action). Each action duration is assumed ~1s for readability.

End of plan (total actions: 101).

Note: Each step exactly corresponds to the plan lines provided. Timestamps are illustrative (1s per action) and included to satisfy the request to provide time information "whenever possible." The agent constraints are preserved in each action label: vowel actions move only A, E, I; consonant actions move the other letters. After executing these steps in order, the intended final stacking goal (the single stack with bottom M then L K J I H G F E D C B A) is reached by construction of the plan.
