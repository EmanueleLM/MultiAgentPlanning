Sequence of concrete actions (matching the plan exactly). Each step shows a timestamp (start → end, 10s per step) and the agent performing the action. Block names are shown uppercase.

Outcome:
- Total plan cost: 25 (unit cost).
- Final tower (goal): K on table; J on K; I on J; H on I; G on H; F on G; E on F; D on E; C on D; B on C; A on B.

Note: Each action above corresponds exactly to the step in the provided plan in order. The agent performing each step is inferred from the action name prefix (move-vowel-* → vowel_agent; move-cons-* → consonant_agent). Timestamping used a fixed 10-second duration per action for readability; replace with actual durations if known.
