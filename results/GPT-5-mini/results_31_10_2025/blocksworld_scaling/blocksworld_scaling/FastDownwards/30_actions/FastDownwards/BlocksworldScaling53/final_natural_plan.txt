Assuming a simple 1-second per action timeline (timestamps shown as HH:MM:SS, starting at 00:00:00), here is the human-readable step-by-step execution of the plan. Each step lists the performing agent, the concrete move, and the source/target as in the plan.

This sequence follows the provided plan exactly (50 actions, same order) and attributes each move to the correct agent (vowel_agent for vowel-labelled blocks A, E, I, O; consonant_agent for all others). Each move corresponds to the action names and parameters in the original PDDL plan.
