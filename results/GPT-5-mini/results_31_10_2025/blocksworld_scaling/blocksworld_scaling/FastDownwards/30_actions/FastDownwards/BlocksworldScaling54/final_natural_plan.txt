Here is a clear, step‑by‑step, human-readable rendering of the provided plan. Each step reports the acting agent, the block moved, the source and the destination. I include a simple timestamp (every 10 seconds) where possible to make the sequence easier to follow. The sequence matches the given plan exactly (no actions added or removed).

Timestamps assume step 1 at 0s and each step takes ~10s (timestamps shown as approximate).

1) [00:00] agent_consonant moves block D from J onto D.
2) [00:10] agent_consonant moves block F from M onto F.
3) [00:20] agent_consonant moves block J from H onto J.
4) [00:30] agent_consonant moves block H from C onto H.
5) [00:40] agent_consonant moves block C from A onto D.
6) [00:50] agent_consonant moves block M from L onto M.
7) [01:00] agent_consonant moves block L from E onto M.
8) [01:10] agent_vowel moves block E from G onto F.
9) [01:20] agent_consonant moves block G from I onto H.
10) [01:30] agent_vowel moves block I from K onto J.
11) [01:40] agent_consonant moves block L from L onto M.
12) [01:50] agent_consonant moves block M from M to table.
13) [02:00] agent_consonant moves block L from L onto M.
14) [02:10] agent_consonant moves block K from table onto L.
15) [02:20] agent_vowel moves block I from J onto I.
16) [02:30] agent_consonant moves block J from J onto K.
17) [02:40] agent_vowel moves block I from I onto J.
18) [02:50] agent_consonant moves block G from H onto G.
19) [03:00] agent_consonant moves block H from H onto I.
20) [03:10] agent_consonant moves block G from G onto H.
21) [03:20] agent_vowel moves block E from F onto E.
22) [03:30] agent_consonant moves block F from F onto G.
23) [03:40] agent_vowel moves block E from E onto F.
24) [03:50] agent_consonant moves block C from D onto C.
25) [04:00] agent_consonant moves block D from D onto E.
26) [04:10] agent_consonant moves block C from C onto D.
27) [04:20] agent_vowel moves block A from B onto A.
28) [04:30] agent_consonant moves block B from table onto C.
29) [04:40] agent_vowel moves block A from A onto B.

Final note (after step 29): the sequence above follows the provided plan exactly (29 actions). According to the plan, these moves achieve the target single tower with blocks (bottom to top): M, L, K, J, I, H, G, F, E, D, C, B, A.
