Below is a step-by-step, human-readable rendering of the provided PDDL plan. Each step reports the acting agent (vowel_agent or consonant_agent), the block moved, the source (which block or table it was on), and the destination. Timestamps assume a fixed 5-second duration per action (timestamps shown are start times).

Plan complete. These steps follow the provided PDDL plan exactly (38 actions) and respect the agent constraints: vowel_agent moves only vowels (A, E, I, O) and consonant_agent moves only consonants.
