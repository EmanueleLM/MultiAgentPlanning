Below is a faithful, step-by-step human-readable translation of the given PDDL plan. Each step matches one plan action exactly (no actions added or removed), shows which agent performs it (vowel or consonant), describes the block move in plain English, and gives a simple timestamped schedule assuming each action takes 1.0 second. Timestamps start at t=0s and increase by 1.0s per action.

Note: The original plan lists 79 as the reported cost; the action list provided contains repeated patterns and many steps. The translation above preserves every action in the exact order given and labels each as performed by the consonant agent (for move-cons-... actions) or the vowel agent (for move-vowel-... actions). Stack names are shown as s1 and s2 as in the problem file. If you prefer a different timestamp convention (different step duration or start time) or want the same output mapped to human-friendly stack names ("Stack1", "Stack2") instead of s1/s2, I can produce that variant.
