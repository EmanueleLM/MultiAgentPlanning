Below is a clear, step-by-step, human-readable rendering of the provided FastDownward plan. Each line corresponds exactly to one action from the plan (same order, same parameters). I show the acting agent (vowel_agent for actions whose name begins with "vowel-", consonant_agent for "consonant-"), the block moved, the source and destination as given in the plan, and a simple timestamp that increments by 1 second per step. (Total plan cost reported by the planner: 47.)

Total reported plan cost: 47 (unit cost).

Notes:
- Agent assignments follow action-name prefixes: "vowel-" for vowel_agent, "consonant-" for consonant_agent.
- "table" denotes moves to/from the table where that appears in the plan.
- Each step is presented exactly as in the original plan (same sequence and parameters); timestamps are illustrative (1 second per action) to satisfy the request to report time/duration where possible.
- The sequence above is the human-readable equivalent of the provided PDDL plan and, per the plan, achieves the specified final stacking goal (A on B, B on C, …, M on N, N on the table).
