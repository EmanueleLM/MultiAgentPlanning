Assuming each action takes 1 time unit, timestamps increase by 1 unit per step. Below are the 26 steps (timestamp, agent, and action), matching the provided plan exactly.

1. t=0 — consonant_agent: Move G (currently on H) onto K. Duration: 1 time unit.  
2. t=1 — consonant_agent: Move H (currently on B) onto I. Duration: 1 time unit.  
3. t=2 — consonant_agent: Move G (currently on K) onto H. Duration: 1 time unit.  
4. t=3 — consonant_agent: Move K (currently on A) to the table. Duration: 1 time unit.  
5. t=4 — vowel_agent: Move A (currently on C) onto B. Duration: 1 time unit.  
6. t=5 — vowel_agent: Move A (currently on B) onto G. Duration: 1 time unit.  
7. t=6 — consonant_agent: Move B (currently on E) onto C. Duration: 1 time unit.  
8. t=7 — vowel_agent: Move A (currently on G) onto B. Duration: 1 time unit.  
9. t=8 — vowel_agent: Move E (currently on J) onto A. Duration: 1 time unit.  
10. t=9 — consonant_agent: Move J (from table) onto K. Duration: 1 time unit.  
11. t=10 — vowel_agent: Move E (currently on A) to the table. Duration: 1 time unit.  
12. t=11 — consonant_agent: Move G (currently on H) to the table. Duration: 1 time unit.  
13. t=12 — consonant_agent: Move H (currently on I) onto A. Duration: 1 time unit.  
14. t=13 — vowel_agent: Move I (currently on D) onto J. Duration: 1 time unit.  
15. t=14 — consonant_agent: Move D (currently on F) onto E. Duration: 1 time unit.  
16. t=15 — consonant_agent: Move H (currently on A) onto I. Duration: 1 time unit.  
17. t=16 — consonant_agent: Move G (from table) onto H. Duration: 1 time unit.  
18. t=17 — consonant_agent: Move F (from table) onto G. Duration: 1 time unit.  
19. t=18 — consonant_agent: Move D (currently on E) onto A. Duration: 1 time unit.  
20. t=19 — vowel_agent: Move E (from table) onto F. Duration: 1 time unit.  
21. t=20 — consonant_agent: Move D (currently on A) onto E. Duration: 1 time unit.  
22. t=21 — vowel_agent: Move A (currently on B) to the table. Duration: 1 time unit.  
23. t=22 — consonant_agent: Move B (currently on C) onto A. Duration: 1 time unit.  
24. t=23 — consonant_agent: Move C (from table) onto D. Duration: 1 time unit.  
25. t=24 — consonant_agent: Move B (currently on A) onto C. Duration: 1 time unit.  
26. t=25 — vowel_agent: Move A (from table) onto B. Duration: 1 time unit.

Final: goal configuration achieved (A on B, B on C, C on D, D on E, E on F, F on G, G on H, H on I, I on J, J on K, K on the table). Total cost: 26 time units.
