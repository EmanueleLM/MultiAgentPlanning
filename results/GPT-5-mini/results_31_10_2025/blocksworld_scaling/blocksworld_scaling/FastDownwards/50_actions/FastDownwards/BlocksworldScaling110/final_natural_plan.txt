Summary: the following 40-step execution follows the provided plan exactly. Each step shows the acting agent, the block moved, source and destination, and a timestamp assuming each action takes 1.0 time unit (start time inclusive, end time exclusive). Total cost = 40, total duration = 40.0 time units.

1) t=0.00 → 1.00 — vowel_agent: move block E from D and place it on I.

14) t=13.00 → 14.00 — vowel_agent: move block A from J and place it on E.
15) t=14.00 → 15.00 — consonant_agent: move block J from B and place it on K.
16) t=15.00 → 16.00 — vowel_agent: move block I from C and place it on J.
17) t=16.00 → 17.00 — consonant_agent: move block B from N and place it on C.
18) t=17.00 → 18.00 — vowel_agent: move block A from E and place it on B.
19) t=18.00 → 19.00 — consonant_agent: move block N from L and place it on the table.
20) t=19.00 → 20.00 — consonant_agent: move block M from the table and place it on N.
21) t=20.00 → 21.00 — consonant_agent: move block L from the table and place it on M.
22) t=21.00 → 22.00 — vowel_agent: move block I from J and place it on the table.
23) t=22.00 → 23.00 — consonant_agent: move block J from K and place it on A.
24) t=23.00 → 24.00 — consonant_agent: move block K from the table and place it on L.
25) t=24.00 → 25.00 — consonant_agent: move block J from A and place it on K.
26) t=25.00 → 26.00 — vowel_agent: move block I from the table and place it on J.
27) t=26.00 → 27.00 — vowel_agent: move block E from F and place it on the table.
28) t=27.00 → 28.00 — consonant_agent: move block F from G and place it on the table.
29) t=28.00 → 29.00 — consonant_agent: move block G from H and place it on A.
