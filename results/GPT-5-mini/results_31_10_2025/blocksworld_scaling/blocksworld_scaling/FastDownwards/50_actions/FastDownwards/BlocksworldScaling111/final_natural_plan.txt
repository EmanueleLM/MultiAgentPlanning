Below is a human-readable, step-by-step execution of the given PDDL plan. I list each action in order, identify the agent (vowel_agent or consonant_agent), state what block is moved from where to where, and give a simple timestamp assuming each action takes 1 time unit (start time inclusive, end time exclusive). Total cost = 23.

1. [t=0.0–1.0] consonant_agent — Move K from on J to the table. (move-consonant-block-to-table k j)  
2. [t=1.0–2.0] consonant_agent — Move J from on E to on K. (move-consonant-block-to-block j e k)  
3. [t=2.0–3.0] vowel_agent — Move I from on F to on J. (move-vowel-block-to-block i f j)  
4. [t=3.0–4.0] vowel_agent — Move E from on H to on F. (move-vowel-block-to-block e h f)  
5. [t=4.0–5.0] consonant_agent — Move H from on D to on I. (move-consonant-block-to-block h d i)  
6. [t=5.0–6.0] vowel_agent — Move E from on F to the table. (move-vowel-block-to-table e f)  
7. [t=6.0–7.0] consonant_agent — Move D from the table to on E. (move-consonant-table-to-block d e)  
8. [t=7.0–8.0] consonant_agent — Move F from on B to the table. (move-consonant-block-to-table f b)  
9. [t=8.0–9.0] consonant_agent — Move B from on G to on D. (move-consonant-block-to-block b g d)  
10. [t=9.0–10.0] consonant_agent — Move G from on A to on H. (move-consonant-block-to-block g a h)  
11. [t=10.0–11.0] vowel_agent — Move A from on C to on B. (move-vowel-block-to-block a c b)  
12. [t=11.0–12.0] consonant_agent — Move F from the table to on G. (move-consonant-table-to-block f g)  
13. [t=12.0–13.0] vowel_agent — Move A from on B to on F. (move-vowel-block-to-block a b f)  
14. [t=13.0–14.0] consonant_agent — Move B from on D to on C. (move-consonant-block-to-block b d c)  
15. [t=14.0–15.0] vowel_agent — Move A from on F to on B. (move-vowel-block-to-block a f b)  
16. [t=15.0–16.0] consonant_agent — Move D from on E to on A. (move-consonant-block-to-block d e a)  
17. [t=16.0–17.0] vowel_agent — Move E from the table to on F. (move-vowel-table-to-block e f)  
18. [t=17.0–18.0] consonant_agent — Move D from on A to on E. (move-consonant-block-to-block d a e)  
19. [t=18.0–19.0] vowel_agent — Move A from on B to the table. (move-vowel-block-to-table a b)  
20. [t=19.0–20.0] consonant_agent — Move B from on C to on A. (move-consonant-block-to-block b c a)  
21. [t=20.0–21.0] consonant_agent — Move C from the table to on D. (move-consonant-table-to-block c d)  
22. [t=21.0–22.0] consonant_agent — Move B from on A to on C. (move-consonant-block-to-block b a c)  
23. [t=22.0–23.0] vowel_agent — Move A from the table to on B. (move-vowel-table-to-block a b)

Final note: All actions follow the agent-specific restrictions (vowel_agent moved only A, E, I; consonant_agent moved only B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K), and each move was of a single clear/top block as required. Total plan cost = 23.
