Notes:
- Each line corresponds exactly to one action in the supplied plan, in the same order.
- Agent assignments follow the domain convention: vowel_agent performs only A, E, I moves; consonant_agent performs moves for all other blocks.
- Timestamps are illustrative (1s per step) to provide durations and ordering; they do not represent real execution time or parallelism.
