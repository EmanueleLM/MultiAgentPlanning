Below is a human-readable, step-by-step rendering of the provided PDDL plan. Each step shows the original plan action, a plain-English description, the agent performing it (vowel_agent or consonant_agent), and a timestamp assuming each action takes 1.0s (start time t=0s, next action at t=1s, etc.). The sequence is identical to the given plan (no actions added or removed).

Total cost: 62 actions (unit cost per action, as in the original plan).

Notes:
- Actions are presented exactly in the same order and with the same parameters as the supplied plan.
- Each "move-vowel" is performed by the vowel agent (acts only on vowel-labelled blocks A/E/I/O per the specification) and each "move-consonant" is performed by the consonant agent (acts only on consonant-labelled blocks).
- Timestamps assume uniform 1.0s per action to satisfy the request to report time information; if you prefer different durations or absolute timestamps, I can update them.
