Below is a human-readable, step-by-step replay of the given PDDL plan. Each step lists the original plan action (in parentheses), the agent performing it (vowel_agent or consonant_agent), the block moved, source and destination, and a timestamp/duration (each action is shown as taking 1.0 time unit, executed sequentially).
