Assumptions:
- Each action takes 1 time unit. I list start and end times as integer timestamps (start inclusive, end exclusive).
- Agent names follow the specification: vowel_agent (may move A, E, I) and consonant_agent (may move B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L).
- I map PDDL parameters as (action X S Y) where X = block moved, S = supporting block (or ignored for table-to-block), Y = destination block (or absent for to-table). I show the action name, agent, and a short natural-language description.

Total cost (unit cost per action): 28

Note: I preserved each action exactly as given in the plan and labeled the performing agent according to the action prefix (vowel-... => vowel_agent; consonant-... => consonant_agent). Some entries contain parameters where source and destination are identical (e.g., "move X from X onto Y" or "move X onto X"); these are transcribed literally from the provided plan.
