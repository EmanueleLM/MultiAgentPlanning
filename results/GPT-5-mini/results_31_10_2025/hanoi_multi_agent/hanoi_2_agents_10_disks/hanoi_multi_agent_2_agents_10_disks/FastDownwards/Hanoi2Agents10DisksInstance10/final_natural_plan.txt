Below is a clear, step-by-step, human-readable trace of the provided PDDL plan. Each line corresponds exactly to one action in the plan (no actions added or removed). For clarity I show which agent performs the move, which disk is moved, the source (either "on top of disk X" or "peg Y"), the destination peg, a timestamp, and a per-step duration. All moves come from agent_1 and only move disks A–E (consistent with the specification).

Step 13 — 00:02:00 (duration 00:00:10): agent_1 moves disk A from on top of disk B to peg middle.
Step 14 — 00:02:10 (duration 00:00:10): agent_1 moves disk B from on top of disk D to on top of disk C.
Step 15 — 00:02:20 (duration 00:00:10): agent_1 moves disk A from peg middle to on top of disk B.
Step 16 — 00:02:30 (duration 00:00:10): agent_1 moves disk D from peg right to peg middle.
Step 17 — 00:02:40 (duration 00:00:10): agent_1 moves disk A from on top of disk B to peg right.
Step 18 — 00:02:50 (duration 00:00:10): agent_1 moves disk A from peg right to on top of disk D.
Step 19 — 00:03:00 (duration 00:00:10): agent_1 moves disk B from on top of disk C to peg right.
Step 20 — 00:03:10 (duration 00:00:10): agent_1 moves disk A from on top of disk D to on top of disk B.
Step 21 — 00:03:20 (duration 00:00:10): agent_1 moves disk C from on top of disk E to on top of disk D.
Step 22 — 00:03:30 (duration 00:00:10): agent_1 moves disk A from on top of disk B to on top of disk E.
Step 23 — 00:03:40 (duration 00:00:10): agent_1 moves disk B from peg right to on top of disk C.
Step 24 — 00:03:50 (duration 00:00:10): agent_1 moves disk A from on top of disk E to on top of disk B.
Step 25 — 00:04:00 (duration 00:00:10): agent_1 moves disk E from on top of disk F to peg right.
Step 26 — 00:04:10 (duration 00:00:10): agent_1 moves disk A from on top of disk B to on top of disk F.
Step 27 — 00:04:20 (duration 00:00:10): agent_1 moves disk A from on top of disk F to on top of disk E.
Step 28 — 00:04:30 (duration 00:00:10): agent_1 moves disk B from on top of disk C to on top of disk F.
Step 29 — 00:04:40 (duration 00:00:10): agent_1 moves disk A from on top of disk E to on top of disk B.
Step 30 — 00:04:50 (duration 00:00:10): agent_1 moves disk C from on top of disk D to on top of disk E.
Step 31 — 00:05:00 (duration 00:00:10): agent_1 moves disk A from on top of disk B to on top of disk D.
Step 32 — 00:05:10 (duration 00:00:10): agent_1 moves disk B from on top of disk F to on top of disk C.
Step 33 — 00:05:20 (duration 00:00:10): agent_1 moves disk A from on top of disk D to on top of disk B.
Step 34 — 00:05:30 (duration 00:00:10): agent_1 moves disk D from peg middle to on top of disk F.

Summary: 34 actions executed by agent_1, total execution time (with 10 s per move) = 340 s (05:40). This sequence exactly matches the provided PDDL plan and respects the constraint that only disks A–E are moved by agent_1.
