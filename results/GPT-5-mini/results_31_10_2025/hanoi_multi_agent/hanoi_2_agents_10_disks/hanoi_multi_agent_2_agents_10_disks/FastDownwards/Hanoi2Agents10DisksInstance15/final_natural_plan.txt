Assuming each primitive move takes 1.00 s and execution starts at t = 0.00 s:

1. [0.00s → 1.00s] agent_1: move disk A from left to middle.
2. [1.00s → 2.00s] agent_1: move disk A from middle to right.
3. [2.00s → 3.00s] agent_1: move disk B from left to middle.
4. [3.00s → 4.00s] agent_1: move disk A from right to middle.
5. [4.00s → 5.00s] agent_1: move disk C from left to right.
6. [5.00s → 6.00s] agent_1: move disk A from middle to right.
7. [6.00s → 7.00s] agent_1: move disk B from middle to left.
8. [7.00s → 8.00s] agent_1: move disk A from right to left.
9. [8.00s → 9.00s] agent_1: move disk C from right to middle.
10. [9.00s → 10.00s] agent_1: move disk A from left to right.
11. [10.00s → 11.00s] agent_1: move disk B from left to middle.
12. [11.00s → 12.00s] agent_1: move disk A from right to middle.
13. [12.00s → 13.00s] agent_1: move disk D from left to right.
14. [13.00s → 14.00s] agent_1: move disk A from middle to left.
15. [14.00s → 15.00s] agent_1: move disk A from left to right.
16. [15.00s → 16.00s] agent_1: move disk B from middle to left.
17. [16.00s → 17.00s] agent_1: move disk A from right to left.
18. [17.00s → 18.00s] agent_1: move disk C from middle to right.
19. [18.00s → 19.00s] agent_1: move disk A from left to right.

Total execution time: 19.00 s.
