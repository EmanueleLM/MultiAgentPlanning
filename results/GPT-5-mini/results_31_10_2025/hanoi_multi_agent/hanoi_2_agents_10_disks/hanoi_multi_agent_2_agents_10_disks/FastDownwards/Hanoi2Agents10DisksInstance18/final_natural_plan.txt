Below is a human-readable, step-by-step execution of the provided plan. Each step matches exactly one action in the plan and shows a timestamp and duration (1s per action). I also note when a disk is placed onto another disk.

Initial state (top → bottom):
- left peg: A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J
- middle peg: (empty)
- right peg: (empty)

Plan (18 steps, each dur=1s):

1) [t=0s, dur=1s] agent_1: move disk A from left peg to middle peg.
2) [t=1s, dur=1s] agent_1: move disk B from left peg to right peg.
3) [t=2s, dur=1s] agent_1: move disk A from middle peg to left peg, placing A on top of disk C.
4) [t=3s, dur=1s] agent_1: move disk A from left peg to right peg, placing A on top of disk B.
5) [t=4s, dur=1s] agent_1: move disk C from left peg to middle peg.
6) [t=5s, dur=1s] agent_1: move disk A from right peg to middle peg, placing A on top of disk C.
7) [t=6s, dur=1s] agent_1: move disk B from right peg to left peg, placing B on top of disk D.
8) [t=7s, dur=1s] agent_1: move disk A from middle peg to right peg.
9) [t=8s, dur=1s] agent_1: move disk B from left peg to middle peg, placing B on top of disk C.
10) [t=9s, dur=1s] agent_1: move disk A from right peg to middle peg, placing A on top of disk B.
11) [t=10s, dur=1s] agent_1: move disk D from left peg to right peg.
12) [t=11s, dur=1s] agent_1: move disk A from middle peg to left peg, placing A on top of disk E.
13) [t=12s, dur=1s] agent_1: move disk B from middle peg to right peg, placing B on top of disk D.
14) [t=13s, dur=1s] agent_1: move disk A from left peg to middle peg, placing A on top of disk C.
15) [t=14s, dur=1s] agent_1: move disk B from right peg to left peg, placing B on top of disk E.
16) [t=15s, dur=1s] agent_1: move disk A from middle peg to left peg, placing A on top of disk B.
17) [t=16s, dur=1s] agent_1: move disk C from middle peg to right peg, placing C on top of disk D.
18) [t=17s, dur=1s] agent_1: move disk A from left peg to right peg, placing A on top of disk C.

Final state (top → bottom):
- left peg: B, E, F, G, H, I, J
- middle peg: (empty)
- right peg: A, C, D

Total cost: 18 units (18 steps × 1s each).
