PROBLEM
------------------------------
Devise a cooperative plan for a 2-agent Tower of Hanoi with 10 disks labelled A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J (A is the smallest, J the largest). Agents are limited to moving specific disks: agent_1 ⇒ A, B, C, D, E; agent_2 ⇒ F, G, H, I, J. Initial configuration: left peg has (top→bottom) A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J; middle peg is empty; right peg is empty. Goal configuration: left peg has (top→bottom) E, F, G, H, I, J; middle peg has (top→bottom) B, D; right peg has (top→bottom) A, C. Provide an ordered list of primitive moves in the format 'agent_i: move disk X from peg1 to peg2', respecting the agent restrictions and the Tower of Hanoi rules.

NATURAL-PLAN sas_plan_1
------------------------------
Below is a clear, step-by-step, human-readable execution of the provided PDDL plan. Each step matches exactly one action in the plan, in the same order, and includes a timestamp (1 time unit per action).

Step 1 (t=0 → 1, duration 1):
agent_1 moves disk A from on top of disk B (left peg) to the middle peg.

Step 2 (t=1 → 2, duration 1):
agent_1 moves disk B from on top of disk C (left peg) to the right peg.

Step 3 (t=2 → 3, duration 1):
agent_1 moves disk A from the middle peg to on top of disk C (left peg).

Step 4 (t=3 → 4, duration 1):
agent_1 moves disk B from the right peg to the middle peg.

Step 5 (t=4 → 5, duration 1):
agent_1 moves disk A from on top of disk C (left peg) to on top of disk B (middle peg).

Step 6 (t=5 → 6, duration 1):
agent_1 moves disk C from on top of disk D (left peg) to the right peg.

Step 7 (t=6 → 7, duration 1):
agent_1 moves disk A from on top of disk B (middle peg) to on top of disk D (left peg).

Step 8 (t=7 → 8, duration 1):
agent_1 moves disk B from the middle peg to on top of disk C (right peg).

Step 9 (t=8 → 9, duration 1):
agent_1 moves disk A from on top of disk D (left peg) to on top of disk B (right peg).

Step 10 (t=9 → 10, duration 1):
agent_1 moves disk D from on top of disk E (left peg) to the middle peg.

Step 11 (t=10 → 11, duration 1):
agent_1 moves disk A from on top of disk B (right peg) to on top of disk E (left peg).

Step 12 (t=11 → 12, duration 1):
agent_1 moves disk B from on top of disk C (right peg) to on top of disk D (middle peg).

Step 13 (t=12 → 13, duration 1):
agent_1 moves disk A from on top of disk E (left peg) to on top of disk C (right peg).

Final configuration (after t=13):
- Left peg top→bottom: E, F, G, H, I, J
- Middle peg top→bottom: B, D
- Right peg top→bottom: A, C

This sequence matches the provided plan exactly (13 moves, performed by agent_1 on disks A–E) and achieves the specified global goal.

PROBLEM
------------------------------
Devise a cooperative plan for a 2-agent Tower of Hanoi with 10 disks labelled A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J (A is the smallest, J the largest). Agents are limited to moving specific disks: agent_1 ⇒ A, B, C, D, E; agent_2 ⇒ F, G, H, I, J. Initial configuration: left peg has (top→bottom) A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J; middle peg is empty; right peg is empty. Goal configuration: left peg has (top→bottom) A, E, F, G, H, I, J; middle peg is empty; right peg has (top→bottom) B, C, D. Provide an ordered list of primitive moves in the format 'agent_i: move disk X from peg1 to peg2', respecting the agent restrictions and the Tower of Hanoi rules.

PROBLEM
------------------------------
Devise a cooperative plan for a 2-agent Tower of Hanoi with 10 disks labelled A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J (A is the smallest, J the largest). Agents are limited to moving specific disks: agent_1 ⇒ A, B, C, D, E; agent_2 ⇒ F, G, H, I, J. Initial configuration: left peg has (top→bottom) A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J; middle peg is empty; right peg is empty. Goal configuration: left peg has (top→bottom) E, F, G, H, I, J; middle peg is empty; right peg has (top→bottom) A, B, C, D. Provide an ordered list of primitive moves in the format 'agent_i: move disk X from peg1 to peg2', respecting the agent restrictions and the Tower of Hanoi rules.

I list the 9 moves exactly in the same order as the plan, with a short timestamp and 1s duration for each move.

1) 2025-10-24T00:00:00Z  (duration 1s)
   agent_1: move disk A from B to A

2) 2025-10-24T00:00:01Z  (duration 1s)

3) 2025-10-24T00:00:02Z  (duration 1s)
   agent_1: move disk A from A to B

4) 2025-10-24T00:00:03Z  (duration 1s)
   agent_1: move disk C from D to C

5) 2025-10-24T00:00:04Z  (duration 1s)
   agent_1: move disk D from E to right

6) 2025-10-24T00:00:05Z  (duration 1s)
   agent_1: move disk C from C to D

7) 2025-10-24T00:00:06Z  (duration 1s)

9) 2025-10-24T00:00:08Z  (duration 1s)
