Mapping used (planner object ids -> domain objects): a = A, b = B, c = C, d = D, e = E, "right" = right peg. All actions below are executed by agent_1 (agent_1 is allowed to move only disks A–E). I list the 9 moves exactly in the same order as the plan, with a short timestamp and 1s duration for each move.

1) 2025-10-24T00:00:00Z  (duration 1s)
   agent_1: move disk A from B to A

2) 2025-10-24T00:00:01Z  (duration 1s)
   agent_1: move disk B from C to B

3) 2025-10-24T00:00:02Z  (duration 1s)
   agent_1: move disk A from A to B

4) 2025-10-24T00:00:03Z  (duration 1s)
   agent_1: move disk C from D to C

5) 2025-10-24T00:00:04Z  (duration 1s)
   agent_1: move disk D from E to right

6) 2025-10-24T00:00:05Z  (duration 1s)
   agent_1: move disk C from C to D

7) 2025-10-24T00:00:06Z  (duration 1s)
   agent_1: move disk A from B to A

8) 2025-10-24T00:00:07Z  (duration 1s)
   agent_1: move disk B from B to C

9) 2025-10-24T00:00:08Z  (duration 1s)
   agent_1: move disk A from A to B

Total reported cost (moves): 9 (unit cost per move).
