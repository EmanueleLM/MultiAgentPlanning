agent_1: move disk A from left to right
  - Description: Agent_1 takes disk A (the smallest disk), which is currently resting on top of disk B on the left peg, and moves it to the right peg. This corresponds exactly to the PDDL action (move-agent1-disk-to-peg a b right) and is allowed because agent_1 may move disk A and the move respects the Tower of Hanoi size constraint.
