Below is a human-readable, step-by-step execution of the provided PDDL plan. Steps are listed in the exact order of the plan (23 actions). Each step shows a start timestamp (cumulative, in seconds from t=0) and a duration of 1s per move.

1) t=0s — Duration: 1s — agent_1: move disk A from disk B to peg right.
2) t=1s — Duration: 1s — agent_1: move disk B from disk C to peg middle.
3) t=2s — Duration: 1s — agent_1: move disk A from peg right onto disk B.
4) t=3s — Duration: 1s — agent_1: move disk C from disk D to peg right.
5) t=4s — Duration: 1s — agent_1: move disk A from disk B onto disk D.
6) t=5s — Duration: 1s — agent_1: move disk B from peg middle onto disk C.
7) t=6s — Duration: 1s — agent_1: move disk A from disk D onto disk B.
8) t=7s — Duration: 1s — agent_1: move disk D from disk E to peg middle.
9) t=8s — Duration: 1s — agent_1: move disk A from disk B onto disk E.
10) t=9s — Duration: 1s — agent_1: move disk B from disk C onto disk D.
11) t=10s — Duration: 1s — agent_1: move disk A from disk E onto disk B.
12) t=11s — Duration: 1s — agent_1: move disk C from peg right onto disk E.
13) t=12s — Duration: 1s — agent_1: move disk A from disk B to peg right.
14) t=13s — Duration: 1s — agent_1: move disk B from disk D onto disk C.
15) t=14s — Duration: 1s — agent_1: move disk A from peg right onto disk B.
16) t=15s — Duration: 1s — agent_1: move disk D from peg middle to peg right.
17) t=16s — Duration: 1s — agent_1: move disk A from disk B to peg middle.
18) t=17s — Duration: 1s — agent_1: move disk B from disk C onto disk D.
19) t=18s — Duration: 1s — agent_1: move disk A from peg middle onto disk C.
20) t=19s — Duration: 1s — agent_1: move disk A from disk C onto disk B.
21) t=20s — Duration: 1s — agent_1: move disk C from disk E to peg middle.
22) t=21s — Duration: 1s — agent_1: move disk A from disk B onto disk E.
23) t=22s — Duration: 1s — agent_1: move disk B from disk D onto disk C.

All 23 moves have been executed in order. These moves are compliant with the agent permissions (agent_1 moved only disks A–H) and follow the Tower of Hanoi constraints (one disk at a time; never placing a larger disk on top of a smaller one). After step 23 the final configuration matches the specified goal arrangement.
