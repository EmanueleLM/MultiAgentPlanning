Plan (human-readable, matching the PDDL plan exactly)

Step 1 — t = 0.0s — agent_1 moves disk A
- Action (plan line): (agent1-move-to-empty a b middle)
- Human-readable: agent_1: move disk A from on top of disk B (both initially on the left peg) to the middle peg.
- Estimated duration: 1.0s
- Resulting configuration after step:
  - Left peg (top→bottom): B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, O
  - Middle peg: A
  - Right peg: (empty)

Step 2 — t = 1.0s — agent_1 moves disk B
- Action (plan line): (agent1-move-to-empty b c right)
- Human-readable: agent_1: move disk B from on top of disk C (left peg) to the right peg.
- Estimated duration: 1.0s
- Resulting configuration after step:
  - Left peg (top→bottom): C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, O
  - Middle peg: A
  - Right peg: B

Final check
- The final configuration matches the specified goal:
  - Left peg top→bottom: C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, O
  - Middle peg: A
  - Right peg: B
- Both moves are legal under Tower of Hanoi rules (each moved disk was clear, each destination was empty, and agent_1 is authorized to move disks A and B). Cost = 2 (two unit moves).
