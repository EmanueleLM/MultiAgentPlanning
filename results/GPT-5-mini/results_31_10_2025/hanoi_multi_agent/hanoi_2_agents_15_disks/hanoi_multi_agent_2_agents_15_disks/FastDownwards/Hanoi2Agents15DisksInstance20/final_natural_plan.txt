Plan (4 steps, executed by agent_1). Each step lists a timestamp and an estimated duration (10s per move).

1) Time 00:00 — Duration 10s
   agent_1: move disk A from on top of disk B to peg right.
   (Action: agent_1 removes the top disk A from disk B and places A onto the right peg.)

2) Time 00:10 — Duration 10s
   agent_1: move disk B from on top of disk C to peg middle.
   (Action: agent_1 removes disk B from disk C and places B onto the middle peg.)

3) Time 00:20 — Duration 10s
   agent_1: move disk A from peg right onto disk B.
   (Action: agent_1 moves A from the right peg and places it on top of disk B on the middle peg.)

4) Time 00:30 — Duration 10s
   agent_1: move disk C from on top of disk D to peg right.
   (Action: agent_1 removes disk C from disk D and places C onto the right peg.)

Outcome (after 00:40): final configuration matches the goal —
 left peg (top->bottom): D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, O
 middle peg (top->bottom): A, B
 right peg (top->bottom): C.
