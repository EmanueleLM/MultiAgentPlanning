Below is a human-readable, step-by-step execution of the provided PDDL plan. Each step exactly corresponds to one action in the plan (no additions or deletions). Every move is performed by agent_1 (agent_2 has no moves here). I give a start timestamp and a 1.0s duration for each move (timestamps cumulative).

Initial state (t = 00:00:00): all disks stacked on left peg top-to-bottom: A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, O. Middle and right pegs empty.

1) t = 00:00:00 → 00:00:01 (duration 1.0s)
   Agent: agent_1
   Action: Move disk A from on top of disk B (left peg) to the right peg.
   Description: take A (top of the left stack) and place it onto the right peg.

2) t = 00:00:01 → 00:00:02 (duration 1.0s)
   Agent: agent_1
   Action: Move disk B from on top of disk C (left peg) to the middle peg.
   Description: take B (now top of left) and place it onto the empty middle peg.

3) t = 00:00:02 → 00:00:03 (duration 1.0s)
   Agent: agent_1
   Action: Move disk A from the right peg to on top of disk C (left peg).
   Description: pick up A from the right peg and place it directly onto disk C (which is on the left peg).

4) t = 00:00:03 → 00:00:04 (duration 1.0s)
   Agent: agent_1
   Action: Move disk A from on top of disk C (left peg) to on top of disk B (middle peg).
   Description: move A from C and place it onto B (so A becomes the top disk on the middle peg above B).

5) t = 00:00:04 → 00:00:05 (duration 1.0s)
   Agent: agent_1
   Action: Move disk C from on top of disk D (left peg) to the right peg.
   Description: remove C from the left stack and place it onto the right peg.

6) t = 00:00:05 → 00:00:06 (duration 1.0s)
   Agent: agent_1
   Action: Move disk A from on top of disk B (middle peg) to on top of disk C (right peg).
   Description: take A from the middle peg and place it onto C on the right peg.

7) t = 00:00:06 → 00:00:07 (duration 1.0s)
   Agent: agent_1
   Action: Move disk B from the middle peg to on top of disk D (left peg).
   Description: move B from the middle peg and place it onto D on the left peg.

8) t = 00:00:07 → 00:00:08 (duration 1.0s)
   Agent: agent_1
   Action: Move disk A from on top of disk C (right peg) to on top of disk B (left peg).
   Description: move A from C and place it onto B (so A becomes the top disk on the left stack above B).

9) t = 00:00:08 → 00:00:09 (duration 1.0s)
   Agent: agent_1
   Action: Move disk C from the right peg to the middle peg.
   Description: transfer C from the right peg to the (now empty) middle peg.

10) t = 00:00:09 → 00:00:10 (duration 1.0s)
    Agent: agent_1
    Action: Move disk A from on top of disk B (left peg) to on top of disk C (middle peg).
    Description: move A from the left stack and place it onto C on the middle peg.

Final state (t = 00:00:10):
- Left peg top-to-bottom: B, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, O
- Middle peg top-to-bottom: A, C
- Right peg: empty

Goal achieved exactly as specified. Total plan duration: 10.0s (10 moves). Cost (unit cost per move) = 10.
