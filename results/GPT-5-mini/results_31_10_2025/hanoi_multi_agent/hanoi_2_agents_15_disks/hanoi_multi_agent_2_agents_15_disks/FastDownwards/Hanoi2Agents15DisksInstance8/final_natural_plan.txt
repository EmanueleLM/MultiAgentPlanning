Start time: 00:00:00. Move interval: 10s per step. All actions performed by agent_1. (Agent_2 performs no actions in this plan.)

1) 00:00:00 — agent_1: move disk A from on top of disk B to right peg
2) 00:00:10 — agent_1: move disk B from on top of disk C to middle peg
3) 00:00:20 — agent_1: move disk A from right peg onto disk B
4) 00:00:30 — agent_1: move disk C from on top of disk D to right peg
5) 00:00:40 — agent_1: move disk A from on top of disk B onto disk D
6) 00:00:50 — agent_1: move disk B from middle peg onto disk C
7) 00:01:00 — agent_1: move disk A from on top of disk D onto disk B
8) 00:01:10 — agent_1: move disk D from on top of disk E to middle peg
9) 00:01:20 — agent_1: move disk A from on top of disk B onto disk D
10) 00:01:30 — agent_1: move disk B from on top of disk C onto disk E
11) 00:01:40 — agent_1: move disk A from on top of disk D onto disk B
12) 00:01:50 — agent_1: move disk C from right peg onto disk D
13) 00:02:00 — agent_1: move disk A from on top of disk B to right peg
14) 00:02:10 — agent_1: move disk B from on top of disk E onto disk C
15) 00:02:20 — agent_1: move disk A from right peg onto disk B
16) 00:02:30 — agent_1: move disk E from on top of disk F to right peg
17) 00:02:40 — agent_1: move disk A from on top of disk B onto disk F
18) 00:02:50 — agent_1: move disk A from on top of disk F onto disk E
19) 00:03:00 — agent_1: move disk B from on top of disk C onto disk F
20) 00:03:10 — agent_1: move disk A from on top of disk E onto disk B
21) 00:03:20 — agent_1: move disk C from on top of disk D onto disk E
22) 00:03:30 — agent_1: move disk A from on top of disk B onto disk D

Summary: 22 actions executed by agent_1, total cost = 22. The sequence follows the provided plan exactly and respects agent_1's disk permissions (A–H) and the Tower of Hanoi rule (never place a larger disk on a smaller one).
