1) Step 1 (t=0.0s → 1.0s): agent_1: move disk A from left (on top of B) to middle (peg).

2) Step 2 (t=1.0s → 2.0s): agent_1: move disk B from left (on top of C) to right (peg).

3) Step 3 (t=2.0s → 3.0s): agent_1: move disk A from middle (peg) to on top of disk B.

4) Step 4 (t=3.0s → 4.0s): agent_1: move disk C from left (on top of D) to middle (peg).

5) Step 5 (t=4.0s → 5.0s): agent_1: move disk A from on top of B to on top of disk D.

6) Step 6 (t=5.0s → 6.0s): agent_1: move disk B from right (peg) to on top of disk C.

7) Step 7 (t=6.0s → 7.0s): agent_1: move disk A from on top of D to on top of disk B.

8) Step 8 (t=7.0s → 8.0s): agent_1: move disk D from on top of E to right (peg).

9) Step 9 (t=8.0s → 9.0s): agent_1: move disk A from on top of B to on top of disk D.

Total actions: 9. Estimated total duration: 9.0s.
