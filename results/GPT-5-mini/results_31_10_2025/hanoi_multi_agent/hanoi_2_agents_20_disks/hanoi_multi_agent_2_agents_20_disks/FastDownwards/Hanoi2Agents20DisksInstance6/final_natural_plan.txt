Final combined ordered list of primitive moves (17 steps, total cost = 17)

1. [t=00:00:00, dur=1s] agent_1: move disk A from left to middle

3. [t=00:00:02, dur=1s] agent_1: move disk A from middle to right
4. [t=00:00:03, dur=1s] agent_1: move disk C from left to middle
5. [t=00:00:04, dur=1s] agent_1: move disk A from right to left

13. [t=00:00:12, dur=1s] agent_1: move disk C from middle to right
14. [t=00:00:13, dur=1s] agent_1: move disk A from left to middle
15. [t=00:00:14, dur=1s] agent_1: move disk B from left to right
16. [t=00:00:15, dur=1s] agent_1: move disk A from middle to right
17. [t=00:00:16, dur=1s] agent_1: move disk E from left to middle

(After these 17 moves the configuration matches the goal: left peg top-to-bottom F G H I J K L M N O P Q R S T, middle peg E, right peg A B C D.)
