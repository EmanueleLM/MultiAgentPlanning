Plan (2 steps, total cost = 2; each move = 1 time unit)

Step 1 — time 0.0 → 1.0 (duration 1.0)
- Action (from plan): (move-agent1-to-peg a b middle)
- Human-readable: agent_1 moves disk A (top disk) from on top of disk B to the middle peg.
  - Formal short: agent_1: move disk A from B to middle.

Step 2 — time 1.0 → 2.0 (duration 1.0)
- Action (from plan): (move-agent1-to-peg b c right)
- Human-readable: agent_1 moves disk B (now top) from on top of disk C to the right peg.
  - Formal short: agent_1: move disk B from C to right.

Resulting configuration (top → bottom on each peg)
- left: C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J
- middle: A
- right: B

The two actions above are exactly those in the provided plan, obey the agents' permissions (agent_1 moved A and B) and achieve the specified goal.
