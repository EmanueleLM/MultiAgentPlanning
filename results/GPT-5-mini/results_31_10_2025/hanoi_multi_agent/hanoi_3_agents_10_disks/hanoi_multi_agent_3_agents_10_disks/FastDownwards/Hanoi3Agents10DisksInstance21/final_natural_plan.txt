Agent(s) executing moves: agent_1 (only disks A, B, C, D — here only A, B, C are moved)
Total cost: 7 (unit cost)
Estimated total duration: 7s (each move estimated 1s)

Step 3 — time 00:00:02 (duration ~1s)
agent_1: move disk A from right to middle
Description: Move disk A from the right peg onto disk B on the middle peg (A is smaller than B).

Step 4 — time 00:00:03 (duration ~1s)
agent_1: move disk C from left to right

Step 5 — time 00:00:04 (duration ~1s)
agent_1: move disk A from middle to right
Description: Move disk A from the middle peg onto disk C on the right peg (A is smaller than C).

Step 6 — time 00:00:05 (duration ~1s)
agent_1: move disk B from middle to left
Description: Move disk B from the middle peg back to the left peg.

Step 7 — time 00:00:06 (duration ~1s)
agent_1: move disk A from right to left

Final verification:
- Disk C is on the right peg (goal satisfied).
- Disks A, B, D, E, F, G, H, I, J are on the left peg in the required order with A clear on top.
- Middle peg is empty.
- All moves respect Tower of Hanoi rules and agent_1 only moved disks it is allowed to move.
