Plan summary (total action cost = 4). Actions executed by agent_1 only.

1) [00:00:00.000 → 00:00:05.000] (duration 5s)
   agent_1: move disk A from on top of disk B to peg middle
   — Equivalent to PDDL: (agent1-move-to-peg A B middle)

2) [00:00:05.000 → 00:00:10.000] (duration 5s)
   agent_1: move disk B from on top of disk C to peg right
   — Equivalent to PDDL: (agent1-move-to-peg B C right)

3) [00:00:10.000 → 00:00:13.000] (duration 3s)
   agent_1: move disk A from peg middle onto disk B (disk B is on peg right)
   — Equivalent to PDDL: (agent1-move-to-disk A middle B)

4) [00:00:13.000 → 00:00:17.000] (duration 4s)
   agent_1: move disk C from on top of disk D to peg middle
   — Equivalent to PDDL: (agent1-move-to-peg C D middle)

Result (after 00:00:17.000): goal configuration reached —
  left peg (top-to-bottom): D, E, F, G, H, I, J
  middle peg: C
  right peg (top-to-bottom): A, B
