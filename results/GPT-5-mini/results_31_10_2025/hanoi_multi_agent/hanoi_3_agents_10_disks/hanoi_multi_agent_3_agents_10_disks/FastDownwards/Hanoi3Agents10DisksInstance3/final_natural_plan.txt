Sequence of human-readable actions (timestamps approximate; each move shown as taking 10s):

1) 00:00:00 → 00:00:10 — agent_1: move disk A from on top of disk B (on the left peg) to the right peg.
2) 00:00:10 → 00:00:20 — agent_1: move disk B from on top of disk C (on the left peg) to the middle peg.
3) 00:00:20 → 00:00:30 — agent_1: move disk A from the right peg to on top of disk B (now on the middle peg).
4) 00:00:30 → 00:00:40 — agent_1: move disk C from on top of disk D (on the left peg) to the right peg.
5) 00:00:40 → 00:00:50 — agent_1: move disk A from on top of disk B (on the middle peg) to on top of disk D (on the left peg).
6) 00:00:50 → 00:01:00 — agent_1: move disk B from the middle peg to on top of disk C (now on the right peg).
7) 00:01:00 → 00:01:10 — agent_1: move disk A from on top of disk D (on the left peg) to the middle peg.

Final configuration after step 7 (matches the goal):
- Left peg, top-to-bottom: D E F G H I J
- Middle peg: A (top and only disk)
- Right peg, top-to-bottom: B (top), C (below)

All moves were performed by agent_1 and respect the Tower of Hanoi rules and the agents' permissions.
