Planned execution (timestamps are illustrative; each move by agent_1 — only the top disks A–D are moved):

1) 00:00:00 — agent_1: move disk A from left to middle  (duration ~10s)  
2) 00:00:10 — agent_1: move disk B from left to right   (duration ~10s)  
3) 00:00:20 — agent_1: move disk A from middle to right (onto disk B)  (duration ~10s)  
4) 00:00:30 — agent_1: move disk C from left to middle  (duration ~10s)  
5) 00:00:40 — agent_1: move disk A from right to middle (onto disk C)  (duration ~10s)  

Total plan cost: 5 (unit cost). Final configuration goal reached as specified.
