Below is a clear, step-by-step human-readable rendering of the provided PDDL plan. Each step corresponds exactly to one action in the plan (no actions added or removed). I show a simple timestamp (start → end) and a 1s duration for each move where possible. Disk labels are shown as in the PDDL problem (A..E) and agent names match the plan (agent_1).

Summary: 19 moves, total cost = 19, total duration = 19s. Final goal configuration achieved as specified.

1. Time 00:00:00 → 00:00:01 (duration 1s)

2. Time 00:00:01 → 00:00:02 (duration 1s)

9. Time 00:00:08 → 00:00:09 (duration 1s)

Final status (after 00:00:19)
- All 19 plan steps executed in order by agent_1 (only disks A–E were moved, in accordance with the agents' permissions).
- Plan cost = 19 (unit cost). The final configuration matches the goal predicates specified in the PDDL problem (left: top->bottom C, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, O with O on peg left; middle contains B (clear); right contains A on D with A clear).
