1) [00:00:01 — duration 1s] agent_1: move disk A from left to right
   - (corresponds to action agent_1_move_a_left_right)

2) [00:00:02 — duration 1s] agent_1: move disk B from left to middle
   - (corresponds to action agent_1_move_b_left_middle)

3) [00:00:03 — duration 1s] agent_1: move disk A from right to middle
   - (corresponds to action agent_1_move_a_right_middle)

4) [00:00:04 — duration 1s] agent_1: move disk C from left to right
   - (corresponds to action agent_1_move_c_left_right)

5) [00:00:05 — duration 1s] agent_1: move disk A from middle to left
   - (corresponds to action agent_1_move_a_middle_left)

Final check: after these five moves the goal is achieved — disk A is placed on disk D on the left peg (supported a d), disk B is on the middle peg, and disk C is on the right peg — all moves respect the Tower of Hanoi rules and only agent_1 moved disks A, B, C as allowed.
