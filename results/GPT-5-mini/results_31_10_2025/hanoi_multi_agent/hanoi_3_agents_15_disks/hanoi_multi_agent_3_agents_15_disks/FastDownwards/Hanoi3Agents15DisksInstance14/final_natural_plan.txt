Here are the 10 moves from the plan, translated into clear human-readable steps. Each step gives the agent, the disk moved, the source and destination (with peg names), a timestamp, and a short duration estimate.

Step 1 (t = 0s, duration 5s): agent_1 moves disk A from on top of disk B (left peg) to the middle peg.
Step 2 (t = 5s, duration 5s): agent_1 moves disk B from on top of disk C (left peg) to the right peg.
Step 3 (t = 10s, duration 5s): agent_1 moves disk A from the middle peg to sit on top of disk C (left peg).
Step 4 (t = 15s, duration 5s): agent_1 moves disk A from on top of disk C (left peg) to sit on top of disk B (right peg).
Step 5 (t = 20s, duration 5s): agent_1 moves disk C from on top of disk D (left peg) to the middle peg.
Step 6 (t = 25s, duration 5s): agent_1 moves disk A from on top of disk B (right peg) to sit on top of disk C (middle peg).
Step 7 (t = 30s, duration 5s): agent_1 moves disk B from the right peg to sit on top of disk D (left peg).
Step 8 (t = 35s, duration 5s): agent_1 moves disk A from on top of disk C (middle peg) to sit on top of disk B (left peg).
Step 9 (t = 40s, duration 5s): agent_1 moves disk C from the middle peg to the right peg.
Step 10 (t = 45s, duration 5s): agent_1 moves disk A from on top of disk B (left peg) to sit on top of disk C (right peg).

Result (after Step 10): Right peg top-to-bottom = A, C; Middle peg = empty; Left peg top-to-bottom = B, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, O — matching the specified goal. (Plan cost = 10 unit moves.)
