Summary: 20 steps (cost = 20). All moves executed by agent_1. Timestamps shown as t=0s, t=1s, ... (one unit per primitive move).

1. t=0s — agent_1: move disk A from on top of disk B to peg middle.
2. t=1s — agent_1: move disk B from on top of disk C to peg right.
3. t=2s — agent_1: move disk A from peg middle to on top of disk C.
4. t=3s — agent_1: move disk A from on top of disk C to on top of disk B.
5. t=4s — agent_1: move disk C from on top of disk D to peg middle.
6. t=5s — agent_1: move disk A from on top of disk B to on top of disk D.
7. t=6s — agent_1: move disk B from peg right to on top of disk C.
8. t=7s — agent_1: move disk A from on top of disk D to peg right.
9. t=8s — agent_1: move disk A from peg right to on top of disk B.
10. t=9s — agent_1: move disk D from on top of disk E to peg right.
11. t=10s — agent_1: move disk A from on top of disk B to on top of disk E.
12. t=11s — agent_1: move disk B from on top of disk C to on top of disk D.
13. t=12s — agent_1: move disk A from on top of disk E to on top of disk B.
14. t=13s — agent_1: move disk C from peg middle to on top of disk E.
15. t=14s — agent_1: move disk A from on top of disk B to peg middle.
16. t=15s — agent_1: move disk A from peg middle to on top of disk C.
17. t=16s — agent_1: move disk B from on top of disk D to peg middle.
18. t=17s — agent_1: move disk A from on top of disk C to on top of disk B.
19. t=18s — agent_1: move disk C from on top of disk E to on top of disk D.
20. t=19s — agent_1: move disk A from on top of disk B to on top of disk E.

End state: after these 20 legal primitive moves (all performed by agent_1 on disks A–E), the final arrangement for disks A–E matches the intended contribution toward the global goal.
