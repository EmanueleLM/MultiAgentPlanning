Planned execution (each move = 1s; start time 00:00:00; total cost = 8s):

1) [00:00:00 → 00:00:01] agent_1: move disk A from left to right (duration: 1s)
2) [00:00:01 → 00:00:02] agent_1: move disk B from left to middle (duration: 1s)
3) [00:00:02 → 00:00:03] agent_1: move disk A from right to left (duration: 1s)
4) [00:00:03 → 00:00:04] agent_1: move disk B from middle to right (duration: 1s)
5) [00:00:04 → 00:00:05] agent_1: move disk A from left to right (duration: 1s)
6) [00:00:05 → 00:00:06] agent_1: move disk C from left to middle (duration: 1s)
7) [00:00:06 → 00:00:07] agent_1: move disk A from right to middle (duration: 1s)
8) [00:00:07 → 00:00:08] agent_1: move disk B from right to left (duration: 1s)

Final verification: after these 8 moves the configuration is
- left peg top-to-bottom: B, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, O, P, Q, R, S, T
- middle peg top-to-bottom: A, C
- right peg: empty

All moves are by agent_1 (allowed for disks A–G), each move transfers a single top disk and respects the Tower of Hanoi rule. Total plan cost = 8 (unit-cost moves).
