Total plan cost: 15 (assume unit duration per primitive move). Timeline starts at t=0s; each step duration = 1s.

1) [t=00:00 – 00:01] agent_1: move disk A from on disk B (left peg) to peg right.
2) [t=00:01 – 00:02] agent_1: move disk B from on disk C (left peg) to peg middle.
3) [t=00:02 – 00:03] agent_1: move disk A from peg right to on disk B (B is on middle).
4) [t=00:03 – 00:04] agent_1: move disk C from on disk D (left peg) to peg right.
5) [t=00:04 – 00:05] agent_1: move disk A from on disk B (B on middle) to on disk C (C on right).
6) [t=00:05 – 00:06] agent_1: move disk B from peg middle to on disk D (D is on left).
7) [t=00:06 – 00:07] agent_1: move disk A from on disk C (C on right) to peg middle.
8) [t=00:07 – 00:08] agent_1: move disk B from on disk D to on disk C (C on right).
9) [t=00:08 – 00:09] agent_1: move disk A from peg middle to on disk B (B on C).
10) [t=00:09 – 00:10] agent_1: move disk D from on disk E (left peg) to peg middle.
11) [t=00:10 – 00:11] agent_1: move disk A from on disk B to on disk E (E is on left).
12) [t=00:11 – 00:12] agent_1: move disk A from on disk E to on disk D (D is on middle).
13) [t=00:12 – 00:13] agent_1: move disk B from on disk C to on disk E.
14) [t=00:13 – 00:14] agent_1: move disk A from on disk D to on disk B.
15) [t=00:14 – 00:15] agent_1: move disk C from peg right to on disk D.

End time: t=00:15. Total duration: 15s. Total cost: 15.
