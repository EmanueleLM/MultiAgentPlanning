1) agent_1: move disk A from left to middle (start 00:00:00, duration 5s)  
2) agent_1: move disk B from left to right (start 00:00:05, duration 5s)  
3) agent_1: move disk A from middle to left (onto disk C) (start 00:00:10, duration 5s)  
4) agent_1: move disk A from left to right (onto disk B) (start 00:00:15, duration 5s)  
5) agent_1: move disk C from left to middle (start 00:00:20, duration 5s)  
6) agent_1: move disk A from right to middle (onto disk C) (start 00:00:25, duration 5s)  
7) agent_1: move disk B from right to left (onto disk D) (start 00:00:30, duration 5s)

All steps are executed by agent_1, respect the agent's permission (A..G), move only top disks, and obey Tower of Hanoi rules.
