Step 1 — t = 0.0 (duration 1 time unit, completes at t = 1.0):
agent_1: move disk A from B to middle

Explanation (concise): agent_1 lifts the top disk A (which is on disk B) and places it onto the middle peg. This single move leaves disks B..T stacked on the left peg in their original order and places A on the middle peg, satisfying the goal.
