1) Time 00:00:00 — duration 1s
   agent_1: move disk A from B to middle
   (Move A off disk B and place A onto the middle peg.)

2) Time 00:00:01 — duration 1s
   agent_1: move disk B from C to right
   (Move B off disk C and place B onto the right peg.)

3) Time 00:00:02 — duration 1s
   agent_1: move disk A from middle to B
   (Move A from the middle peg and place A onto disk B on the right peg.)

Resulting configuration (after these steps):
- Left peg top→bottom: C D E F G H I J K L M N O P Q R S T
- Middle peg: empty
- Right peg top→bottom: A B

This sequence exactly follows the provided plan and achieves the specified goal.
