Mapping note: the plan uses lowercase symbols (a,b,c,d) which correspond to disks A,B,C,D in the problem. I list each plan step (PDDL) followed by a clear human-readable action in the required agent format, with a timestamp and a short duration.

1) PDDL: (agent_1_move_to_peg a b right)
   Time: 00:00:00 — Duration: 1s
   agent_1: move disk A from B to right

2) PDDL: (agent_1_move_to_peg b c middle)
   Time: 00:00:01 — Duration: 1s
   agent_1: move disk B from C to middle

3) PDDL: (agent_1_move_to_disk a right b)
   Time: 00:00:02 — Duration: 1s
   agent_1: move disk A from right to B

4) PDDL: (agent_1_move_to_peg c d right)
   Time: 00:00:03 — Duration: 1s
   agent_1: move disk C from D to right

5) PDDL: (agent_1_move_to_disk a b d)
   Time: 00:00:04 — Duration: 1s
   agent_1: move disk A from B to D

These five steps exactly follow the provided plan and are compliant with the agent/disk restrictions and Tower of Hanoi rules.
