Below is a human-readable, step-by-step execution of the provided PDDL plan. I mapped the lowercase names in the plan to the disk and peg names used in the PDDL problem (a->A, b->B, c->C, d->D, e->E; pegmiddle->pegMiddle, pegright->pegRight). Each step shows a timestamp assuming each move takes 1 time unit (start time -> end time). All moves are by agent_1 and only move disks A..G (here A..E), so they respect the agent move restrictions and the Tower of Hanoi rules.

1. Time [0 → 1] (duration 1): agent_1 — move disk A from on top of disk B (pegLeft) to pegMiddle.
2. Time [1 → 2] (duration 1): agent_1 — move disk B from on top of disk C (pegLeft) to pegRight.
3. Time [2 → 3] (duration 1): agent_1 — move disk A from pegMiddle to on top of disk B (pegRight).
4. Time [3 → 4] (duration 1): agent_1 — move disk C from on top of disk D (pegLeft) to pegMiddle.
5. Time [4 → 5] (duration 1): agent_1 — move disk A from on top of disk B (pegRight) to on top of disk D (pegLeft).
6. Time [5 → 6] (duration 1): agent_1 — move disk B from pegRight to on top of disk C (pegMiddle).
7. Time [6 → 7] (duration 1): agent_1 — move disk A from on top of disk D (pegLeft) to on top of disk B (pegMiddle).
8. Time [7 → 8] (duration 1): agent_1 — move disk D from on top of disk E (pegLeft) to pegRight.
9. Time [8 → 9] (duration 1): agent_1 — move disk A from on top of disk B (pegMiddle) to on top of disk D (pegRight).
10. Time [9 → 10] (duration 1): agent_1 — move disk B from on top of disk C (pegMiddle) to on top of disk E (pegLeft).
11. Time [10 → 11] (duration 1): agent_1 — move disk A from on top of disk D (pegRight) to on top of disk B (pegLeft).
12. Time [11 → 12] (duration 1): agent_1 — move disk C from pegMiddle to on top of disk D (pegRight).
13. Time [12 → 13] (duration 1): agent_1 — move disk A from on top of disk B (pegLeft) to pegMiddle.
14. Time [13 → 14] (duration 1): agent_1 — move disk B from on top of disk E (pegLeft) to on top of disk C (pegRight).

Total plan cost (sum of unit durations): 14 time units.

Notes:
- I preserved the exact order and number of actions from the given plan.
- All actions are by agent_1 and only move disks A..E (subset of agent_1's allowed set A..G), so agent permissions are respected.
- Each move description indicates whether the disk is moved from a peg or from on top of another disk; target locations similarly indicate peg or on top of a specific disk.
