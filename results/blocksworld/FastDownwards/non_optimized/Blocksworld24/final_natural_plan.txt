Plan to reach final stack A (top) → B → C → D → E → F → G → H → I → J → K → L → M → N (N on table).
Notes: vowel_agent manipulates only vowels (A, E, I); consonant_agent manipulates consonants. Actions are listed in order and timestamps assume each action takes 1.0 time unit, starting at t=0.0. Each step shows: step number, time interval, agent action (PDDL action), brief human description, immediate effect.
