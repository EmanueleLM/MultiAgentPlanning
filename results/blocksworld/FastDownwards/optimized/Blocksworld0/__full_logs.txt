PROBLEM
------------------------------
Two agents are tasked with manipulating blocks arranged in stacks on a table, from one configuration to another. Each block is uniquely labelled by a letter. Both agents can only interact with blocks at the top of each stack, and only interact with one block at a time. Additionally, one agent can only interact with vowel blocks, and the other can only interact with consonant blocks. Initially there are blocks L, J, H, I, G, K, B, E, F, C, D, A. L is on the table, J is on the table, H is on top of L, I is on the table, G is on top of H, K is on top of J, B is on top of I, E is on top of B, F is on top of E, C is on top of K, D is on top of C, A is on top of G. The goal is to have A is on top of B, B is on top of C, C is on top of D, D is on top of E, E is on top of F, F is on top of G, G is on top of H, H is on top of I, I is on top of J, J is on top of K, K is on top of L, L is on the table.

NATURAL-PLAN sas_plan_0
------------------------------
Summary: two actions (unit cost each) execute in order and achieve the goal tower A on B on C on D on E on F on G on H on I on J (J on table).

1) Step 1 — Time 0.0 → 1.0 (duration 1.0 unit)
- Agent: consonant_agent
- Action: consonant_move-from-table-to-block
- Parameters: move block B from the table onto block C
- Preconditions (checked and satisfied at time 0.0):
  - B is on the table (ontable B)
  - B is clear (clear B)
  - C is clear (clear C)
  - B and C are consonant-labeled blocks (allowed for consonant_agent)
- Effects (applied at time 1.0):
  - B is no longer on the table (not ontable B)
  - B is now on C (on B C)
  - C is no longer clear (not clear C)
  - B is clear (clear B)
- State after step 1 (relevant facts):
  - on B C
  - clear B
  - not clear C
  - B not on table

2) Step 2 — Time 1.0 → 2.0 (duration 1.0 unit)
- Agent: vowel_agent
- Action: vowel_move-from-table-to-block
- Parameters: move block A from the table onto block B
- Preconditions (checked and satisfied at time 1.0):
  - A is on the table (ontable A)
  - A is clear (clear A)
  - B is clear (clear B) — satisfied because Step 1 left B clear
  - A is vowel-labeled (allowed for vowel_agent)
- Effects (applied at time 2.0):
  - A is no longer on the table (not ontable A)
  - A is now on B (on A B)
  - B is no longer clear (not clear B)
  - A is clear (clear A)
- State after step 2 (relevant facts):
  - on A B
  - on B C
  - clear A
  - not clear B
  - not clear C

Final check (time 2.0): The full goal is satisfied because the tower now has A on B, B on C, and the original stack C on D on E on F on G on H on I on J remains unchanged, with J on the table. Thus the goal A on B, B on C, C on D, D on E, E on F, F on G, G on H, H on I, I on J, and J on table is achieved.
