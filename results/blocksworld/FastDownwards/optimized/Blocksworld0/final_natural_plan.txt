Summary: two actions (unit cost each) execute in order and achieve the goal tower A on B on C on D on E on F on G on H on I on J (J on table).

1) Step 1 — Time 0.0 → 1.0 (duration 1.0 unit)
- Agent: consonant_agent
- Action: consonant_move-from-table-to-block
- Parameters: move block B from the table onto block C
- Preconditions (checked and satisfied at time 0.0):
  - B is on the table (ontable B)
  - B is clear (clear B)
  - C is clear (clear C)
  - B and C are consonant-labeled blocks (allowed for consonant_agent)
- Effects (applied at time 1.0):
  - B is no longer on the table (not ontable B)
  - B is now on C (on B C)
  - C is no longer clear (not clear C)
  - B is clear (clear B)
- State after step 1 (relevant facts):
  - on B C
  - clear B
  - not clear C
  - B not on table

2) Step 2 — Time 1.0 → 2.0 (duration 1.0 unit)
- Agent: vowel_agent
- Action: vowel_move-from-table-to-block
- Parameters: move block A from the table onto block B
- Preconditions (checked and satisfied at time 1.0):
  - A is on the table (ontable A)
  - A is clear (clear A)
  - B is clear (clear B) — satisfied because Step 1 left B clear
  - A is vowel-labeled (allowed for vowel_agent)
- Effects (applied at time 2.0):
  - A is no longer on the table (not ontable A)
  - A is now on B (on A B)
  - B is no longer clear (not clear B)
  - A is clear (clear A)
- State after step 2 (relevant facts):
  - on A B
  - on B C
  - clear A
  - not clear B
  - not clear C

Final check (time 2.0): The full goal is satisfied because the tower now has A on B, B on C, and the original stack C on D on E on F on G on H on I on J remains unchanged, with J on the table. Thus the goal A on B, B on C, C on D, D on E, E on F, F on G, G on H, H on I, I on J, and J on table is achieved.
