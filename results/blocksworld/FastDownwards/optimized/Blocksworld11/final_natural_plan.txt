Summary: Each action below follows the given plan exactly. I show each step with a simple timestamp (each action takes 1.0 time unit) and a clear human-readable description of what the named agent does. All block names are shown in uppercase. The actions respect the agents' capabilities (vowel_agent moves only A, E, I; consonant_agent moves the other blocks).

Step 1 (t = 0.0s → 1.0s): consonant_agent unstack C from D — consonant_agent lifts C off D and is now holding C; D becomes clear.

Step 2 (t = 1.0s → 2.0s): consonant_agent put down C — consonant_agent places C onto the table and releases it (C is now on the table and clear).

Step 9 (t = 8.0s → 9.0s): consonant_agent stack F onto C — consonant_agent places the held F on top of C and releases F (F is now on C).

Step 10 (t = 9.0s → 10.0s): consonant_agent unstack G from K — consonant_agent lifts G off K and is now holding G; K becomes clear.

Step 11 (t = 10.0s → 11.0s): consonant_agent stack G onto D — consonant_agent places the held G on top of D and releases G (G is now on D).

Step 12 (t = 11.0s → 12.0s): consonant_agent unstack K from J — consonant_agent lifts K off J and is now holding K; J becomes clear.

Step 13 (t = 12.0s → 13.0s): consonant_agent put down K — consonant_agent places K onto the table and releases it (K is now on the table and clear).

Step 14 (t = 13.0s → 14.0s): consonant_agent pick up J from the table — consonant_agent lifts J from the table and is now holding J (J is no longer on the table).

Step 15 (t = 14.0s → 15.0s): consonant_agent stack J onto K — consonant_agent places the held J on top of K and releases J (J is now on K).

Step 16 (t = 15.0s → 16.0s): vowel_agent stack A onto B — vowel_agent places the held A on top of B and releases A (A is now on B).

Step 17 (t = 16.0s → 17.0s): vowel_agent unstack I from H — vowel_agent lifts I off H and is now holding I; H becomes clear.

Step 18 (t = 17.0s → 18.0s): consonant_agent unstack H from E — consonant_agent lifts H off E and is now holding H; E becomes clear.

Step 19 (t = 18.0s → 19.0s): vowel_agent stack I onto J — vowel_agent places the held I on top of J and releases I (I is now on J).

Step 20 (t = 19.0s → 20.0s): vowel_agent pick up E from the table — vowel_agent lifts E from the table and is now holding E (E is no longer on the table).

Step 21 (t = 20.0s → 21.0s): consonant_agent stack H onto I — consonant_agent places the held H on top of I and releases H (H is now on I).

Step 22 (t = 21.0s → 22.0s): consonant_agent unstack G from D — consonant_agent lifts G off D and is now holding G; D becomes clear.

Step 23 (t = 22.0s → 23.0s): consonant_agent stack G onto H — consonant_agent places the held G on top of H and releases G (G is now on H).

Step 24 (t = 23.0s → 24.0s): consonant_agent unstack F from C — consonant_agent lifts F off C and is now holding F; C becomes clear.

Step 25 (t = 24.0s → 25.0s): consonant_agent stack F onto G — consonant_agent places the held F on top of G and releases F (F is now on G).

Step 26 (t = 25.0s → 26.0s): consonant_agent pick up D from the table — consonant_agent lifts D from the table and is now holding D (D is no longer on the table).

Step 27 (t = 26.0s → 27.0s): vowel_agent stack E onto F — vowel_agent places the held E on top of F and releases E (E is now on F).

Step 28 (t = 27.0s → 28.0s): consonant_agent stack D onto E — consonant_agent places the held D on top of E and releases D (D is now on E).

Step 29 (t = 28.0s → 29.0s): consonant_agent pick up C from the table — consonant_agent lifts C from the table and is now holding C (C is no longer on the table).

Step 30 (t = 29.0s → 30.0s): consonant_agent stack C onto D — consonant_agent places the held C on top of D and releases C (C is now on D).

Step 31 (t = 30.0s → 31.0s): vowel_agent unstack A from B — vowel_agent lifts A off B and is now holding A; B becomes clear.

Step 32 (t = 31.0s → 32.0s): consonant_agent pick up B from the table — consonant_agent lifts B from the table and is now holding B (B is no longer on the table).

Step 33 (t = 32.0s → 33.0s): consonant_agent stack B onto C — consonant_agent places the held B on top of C and releases B (B is now on C).

Step 34 (t = 33.0s → 34.0s): vowel_agent stack A onto B — vowel_agent places the held A on top of B and releases A (A is now on B).
