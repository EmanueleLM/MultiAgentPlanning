Timeline (each step ~1s apart). Agents: Consonant agent (moves consonant-labeled blocks B C D F G H J), Vowel agent (moves vowel-labeled blocks A E I).

1. t=0s (duration 1s): Consonant agent moves block B from G onto block C.
2. t=1s (duration 1s): Consonant agent moves block G from I onto block G.
3. t=2s (duration 1s): Vowel agent moves block I from F onto block I.
4. t=3s (duration 1s): Consonant agent moves block F from E onto block G.
5. t=4s (duration 1s): Vowel agent moves block E from J onto block F.
6. t=5s (duration 1s): Vowel agent moves block I from I onto block J.
7. t=6s (duration 1s): Consonant agent moves block B from C onto block B.

This sequence follows the given plan exactly (32 actions) and attributes each move to the appropriate agent (vowel agent for A/E/I moves, consonant agent for B/C/D/F/G/H moves).
