PROBLEM
------------------------------
Two agents are tasked with manipulating blocks arranged in stacks on a table, from one configuration to another. Each block is uniquely labelled by a letter. Both agents can only interact with blocks at the top of each stack, and only interact with one block at a time. Additionally, one agent can only interact with vowel blocks, and the other can only interact with consonant blocks. Initially there are blocks L, J, H, I, G, K, B, E, F, C, D, A. L is on the table, J is on the table, H is on top of L, I is on the table, G is on top of H, K is on top of J, B is on top of I, E is on top of B, F is on top of E, C is on top of K, D is on top of C, A is on top of G. The goal is to have A is on top of B, B is on top of C, C is on top of D, D is on top of E, E is on top of F, F is on top of G, G is on top of H, H is on top of I, I is on top of J, J is on top of K, K is on top of L, L is on the table.

PROBLEM
------------------------------
Two agents are tasked with manipulating blocks arranged in stacks on a table, from one configuration to another. Each block is uniquely labelled by a letter. Both agents can only interact with blocks at the top of each stack, and only interact with one block at a time. Additionally, one agent can only interact with vowel blocks, and the other can only interact with consonant blocks. Initially there are blocks M, C, B, G, E, N, J, L, F, I, K, D, A, H. M is on the table, C is on the table, B is on top of C, G is on top of B, E is on top of M, N is on top of E, J is on top of G, L is on top of N, F is on top of L, I is on top of J, K is on top of F, D is on top of I, A is on top of D, H is on top of A. The goal is to have A is on top of B, B is on top of C, C is on top of D, D is on top of E, E is on top of F, F is on top of G, G is on top of H, H is on top of I, I is on top of J, J is on top of K, K is on top of L, L is on top of M, M is on top of N, N is on the table.

Both agents can only interact with blocks at the top of each stack, and only interact with one block at a time. Additionally, one agent can only interact with vowel blocks, and the other can only interact with consonant blocks. Initially there are blocks M, C, B, G, E, N, J, L, F, I, K, D, A, H. M is on the table, C is on the table, B is on top of C, G is on top of B, E is on top of M, N is on top of E, J is on top of G, L is on top of N, F is on top of L, I is on top of J, K is on top of F, D is on top of I, A is on top of D, H is on top of A. The goal is to have A is on top of B, B is on top of C, C is on top of D, D is on top of E, E is on top of F, F is on top of G, G is on top of H, H is on top of I, I is on top of J, J is on top of K, K is on top of L, L is on top of M, M is on top of N, N is on the table.",

NATURAL-PLAN sas_plan_0
------------------------------
1) [t=0.0s → 5.0s] vowel_agent picks block A from the table.
   - Action corresponds to: (vowel-pick-from-table vowel_agent a)
   - Preconditions satisfied: A is on the table, A is clear, vowel_agent's hand is empty.
   - Result: vowel_agent is holding A; A is no longer on the table and is not clear.

2) [t=5.0s → 10.0s] consonant_agent picks block B from the table.
   - Action corresponds to: (consonant-pick-from-table consonant_agent b)
   - Preconditions satisfied: B is on the table, B is clear, consonant_agent's hand is empty.
   - Result: consonant_agent is holding B; B is no longer on the table and is not clear.

3) [t=10.0s → 15.0s] consonant_agent places block B onto block C.
   - Action corresponds to: (consonant-place-on consonant_agent b c)
   - Preconditions satisfied: consonant_agent is holding B and C is clear.
   - Result: B is now on C; B is clear; consonant_agent's hand is empty; C is no longer clear.

4) [t=15.0s → 20.0s] vowel_agent places block A onto block B.
   - Action corresponds to: (vowel-place-on vowel_agent a b)
   - Preconditions satisfied: vowel_agent is holding A and B is clear (after step 3 B became clear on top of C).
   - Result: A is now on B; A is clear; vowel_agent's hand is empty; B is no longer clear.

Final status: A on B on C on D on E on F on G on H on I on J, with J on the table — the specified goal configuration has been achieved.

PROBLEM
------------------------------
Two agents are tasked with manipulating blocks arranged in stacks on a table, from one configuration to another. Each block is uniquely labelled by a letter. Both agents can only interact with blocks at the top of each stack, and only interact with one block at a time. Additionally, one agent can only interact with vowel blocks, and the other can only interact with consonant blocks. Initially there are blocks L, F, K, C, G, H, D, B, J, E, I, A. L is on the table, F is on top of L, K is on the table, C is on top of F, G is on the table, H is on top of K, D is on top of H, B is on top of D, J is on top of B, E is on top of J, I is on the table, A is on top of I. The goal is to have A is on top of B, B is on top of C, C is on top of D, D is on top of E, E is on top of F, F is on top of G, G is on top of H, H is on top of I, I is on top of J, J is on top of K, K is on top of L, L is on the table.

Ambiguities may appear in different forms for example two PDDL problems may refer to the same object with different names. Here is the information the first agent has and its PDDL response: {pddl_vowel_agent} Here is the information the second agent has and its PDDL response: {pddl_consonant_agent} You need to integrate the PDDL responses of the two agents to solve the task. It is important that you keep the actions of the two agents distinct. Think step by step and provide a combined PDDL domain and a PDDL problem file suitable for FastDownwards. Enclose the PDDL domain between <domain></domain> tags and the PDDL problem between <problem></problem> tags."

NATURAL-PLAN sas_plan_2
------------------------------
Step 1 (time 0 → 1, duration = 1 unit, cost = 1):
- Action: vowel_agent executes vowel-move A from table to B.
- Natural description: The vowel agent picks up block A (a vowel) from the table and places it on top of block B.
- PDDL action form: (vowel-move A table B)

Resulting immediate effects:
- A is no longer on the table and now is on B.
- The table becomes clear (if nothing else was on that table position).
- B is no longer clear (it now has A on top).

Goal check after Step 1:
- All goal predicates hold:
  - A on B (achieved by this action)
  - B on C
  - C on D
  - D on E
  - E on F
  - F on G
  - G on H
  - H on I
  - I on J
  - J on table

The single planned action completes the task.
================================================================================


PROBLEM
------------------------------
Two agents are tasked with manipulating blocks arranged in stacks on a table, from one configuration to another. Each block is uniquely labelled by a letter. Both agents can only interact with blocks at the top of each stack, and only interact with one block at a time. Additionally, one agent can only interact with vowel blocks, and the other can only interact with consonant blocks. Initially there are blocks C, B, I, F, D, A, E, G, H, J. C is on the table, B is on the table, I is on top of C, F is on top of I, D is on top of B, A is on top of D, E is on top of A, G is on top of E, H is on top of G, J is on top of F. The goal is to have A is on top of B, B is on top of C, C is on top of D, D is on top of E, E is on top of F, F is on top of G, G is on top of H, H is on top of I, I is on top of J, J is on the table.

NATURAL-PLAN sas_plan_1
------------------------------
Plan (total cost = 2; each action cost = 1, assumed duration = 1 time unit)

1) Time 0.0 → 1.0 (duration 1)
   Action: vowel_agent — pick-vowel-from-table A
   - Description: The vowel agent picks up block A from the table.
   - Preconditions satisfied: A is on the table and clear; vowel agent's hand is free.
   - Effects: A is no longer on the table; vowel agent is now holding A (hand is not free).

2) Time 1.0 → 2.0 (duration 1)
   Action: vowel_agent — put-vowel-on A B
   - Description: The vowel agent places block A onto block B.
   - Preconditions satisfied: vowel agent is holding A; B is clear.
   - Effects: A is on B; A becomes clear; B is no longer clear; vowel agent's hand becomes free.

Result after step 2:
- Goal achieved: A on B, B on C, C on D, D on E, and E on the table.
- Constraints respected: only the vowel agent manipulated a vowel block (A); only top blocks were moved; actions and costs match the provided plan.
================================================================================


PROBLEM
------------------------------
Two agents are tasked with manipulating blocks arranged in stacks on a table, from one configuration to another. Each block is uniquely labelled by a letter. Both agents can only interact with blocks at the top of each stack, and only interact with one block at a time. Additionally, one agent can only interact with vowel blocks, and the other can only interact with consonant blocks. Initially there are blocks D, A, K, J, C, F, G, I, E, H, B. D is on the table, A is on the table, K is on top of D, J is on the table, C is on top of J, F is on top of C, G is on top of F, I is on the table, E is on top of I, H is on top of K, B is on top of A. The goal is to have A is on top of B, B is on top of C, C is on top of D, D is on top of E, E is on top of F, F is on top of G, G is on top of H, H is on top of I, I is on top of J, J is on top of K, K is on the table.

Both agents can only interact with blocks at the top of each stack, and only interact with one block at a time. Additionally, one agent can only interact with vowel blocks, and the other can only interact with consonant blocks. Initially there are blocks D, A, K, J, C, F, G, I, E, H, B. D is on the table, A is on the table, K is on top of D, J is on the table, C is on top of J, F is on top of C, G is on top of F, I is on the table, E is on top of I, H is on top of K, B is on top of A.

NATURAL-PLAN sas_plan_1
------------------------------
Step 1 — t = 0 → 1 (duration: 1 time unit, cost = 1)
- Agent: vowel_agent
- Action: Move block A from the table onto block B.
- Description: vowel_agent picks up vowel block A (which is on the table and clear) and places it on top of block B (which is clear).
- Resulting state (relevant facts): A is on B; A is no longer on the table; B is no longer clear.

Outcome: After this single action the goal is achieved: the stack A on B on C on D on E on F on G on H on I on J with J on the table.
================================================================================


PROBLEM
------------------------------
Two agents are tasked with manipulating blocks arranged in stacks on a table, from one configuration to another. Each block is uniquely labelled by a letter. Both agents can only interact with blocks at the top of each stack, and only interact with one block at a time. Additionally, one agent can only interact with vowel blocks, and the other can only interact with consonant blocks. Initially there are blocks I, B, L, A, F, H, D, G, C, E, K, J. I is on the table, B is on the table, L is on top of I, A is on top of B, F is on top of L, H is on top of A, D is on top of H, G is on top of F, C is on top of G, E is on top of D, K is on top of E, J is on the table. The goal is to have A is on top of B, B is on top of C, C is on top of D, D is on top of E, E is on top of F, F is on top of G, G is on top of H, H is on top of I, I is on top of J, J is on top of K, K is on top of L, L is on the table.

================================================================================


PROBLEM
------------------------------
Two agents are tasked with manipulating blocks arranged in stacks on a table, from one configuration to another. Each block is uniquely labelled by a letter. Both agents can only interact with blocks at the top of each stack, and only interact with one block at a time. Additionally, one agent can only interact with vowel blocks, and the other can only interact with consonant blocks. Initially there are blocks A, C, I, D, L, K, E, H, F, G, J, B. A is on the table, C is on the table, I is on top of A, D is on top of C, L is on top of I, K is on top of L, E is on top of K, H is on top of D, F is on top of E, G is on top of H, J is on top of G, B is on top of J. The goal is to have A is on top of B, B is on top of C, C is on top of D, D is on top of E, E is on top of F, F is on top of G, G is on top of H, H is on top of I, I is on top of J, J is on top of K, K is on top of L, L is on the table.

Both agents can only interact with blocks at the top of each stack, and only interact with one block at a time. Additionally, one agent can only interact with vowel blocks, and the other can only interact with consonant blocks. Initially there are blocks A, C, I, D, L, K, E, H, F, G, J, B. A is on the table, C is on the table, I is on top of A, D is on top of C, L is on top of I, K is on top of L, E is on top of K, H is on top of D, F is on top of E, G is on top of H, J is on top of G, B is on top of J. The goal is to have A is on top of B, B is on top of C, C is on top of D, D is on top of E, E is on top of F, F is on top of G, G is on top of H, H is on top of I, I is on top of J, J is on top of K, K is on top of L, L is on the table.",

Both agents can only interact with blocks at the top of each stack, and only interact with one block at a time. Additionally, one agent can only interact with vowel blocks, and the other can only interact with consonant blocks. Initially there are blocks A, C, I, D, L, K, E, H, F, G, J, B. A is on the table, C is on the table, I is on top of A, D is on top of C, L is on top of I, K is on top of L, E is on top of K, H is on top of D, F is on top of E, G is on top of H, J is on top of G, B is on top of J. The goal is to have A is on top of B, B is on top of C, C is on top of D, D is on top of E, E is on top of F, F is on top of G, G is on top of H, H is on top of I, I is on top of J, J is on top of K, K is on top of L, L is on the table.",

    "human_specification": "Two agents are tasked with manipulating blocks arranged in stacks on a table, from one configuration to another. Each block is uniquely labelled by a letter. Both agents can only interact with blocks at the top of each stack, and only interact with one block at a time. Additionally, one agent can only interact with vowel blocks, and the other can only interact with consonant blocks. Initially there are blocks A, C, I, D, L, K, E, H, F, G, J, B. A is on the table, C is on the table, I is on top of A, D is on top of C, L is on top of I, K is on top of L, E is on top of K, H is on top of D, F is on top of E, G is on top of H, J is on top of G, B is on top of J. The goal is to have A is on top of B, B is on top of C, C is on top of D, D is on top of E, E is on top of F, F is on top of G, G is on top of H, H is on top of I, I is on top of J, J is on top of K, K is on top of L, L is on the table.",

Both agents can only interact with blocks at the top of each stack, and only interact with one block at a time. Additionally, one agent can only interact with vowel blocks, and the other can only interact with consonant blocks. Initially there are blocks A, C, I, D, L, K, E, H, F, G, J, B. A is on the table, C is on the table, I is on top of A, D is on top of C, L is on top of I, K is on top of L, E is on top of K, H is on top of D, F is on top of E, G is on top of H, J is on top of G, B is on top of J.

PROBLEM
------------------------------
Two agents are tasked with manipulating blocks arranged in stacks on a table, from one configuration to another. Each block is uniquely labelled by a letter. Both agents can only interact with blocks at the top of each stack, and only interact with one block at a time. Additionally, one agent can only interact with vowel blocks, and the other can only interact with consonant blocks. Initially there are blocks H, L, B, K, C, A, J, E, I, D, G, F. H is on the table, L is on the table, B is on top of H, K is on the table, C is on top of B, A is on the table, J is on top of L, E is on top of C, I is on top of J, D is on top of K, G is on top of D, F is on top of E. The goal is to have A is on top of B, B is on top of C, C is on top of D, D is on top of E, E is on top of F, F is on top of G, G is on top of H, H is on top of I, I is on top of J, J is on top of K, K is on top of L, L is on the table.

PROBLEM
------------------------------
Two agents are tasked with manipulating blocks arranged in stacks on a table, from one configuration to another. Each block is uniquely labelled by a letter. Both agents can only interact with blocks at the top of each stack, and only interact with one block at a time. Additionally, one agent can only interact with vowel blocks, and the other can only interact with consonant blocks. Initially there are blocks I, D, F, C, H, G, E, M, L, A, N, B, J, K. I is on the table, D is on the table, F is on top of D, C is on top of I, H is on top of C, G is on top of H, E is on top of F, M is on top of E, L is on top of M, A is on top of G, N is on top of A, B is on top of L, J is on top of B, K is on top of N. The goal is to have A is on top of B, B is on top of C, C is on top of D, D is on top of E, E is on top of F, F is on top of G, G is on top of H, H is on top of I, I is on top of J, J is on top of K, K is on top of L, L is on top of M, M is on top of N, N is on the table.

NATURAL-PLAN sas_plan_0
------------------------------
Below is a step-by-step, human-readable trace of the provided PDDL plan. Each step lists (1) the executing agent, (2) the exact action from the plan (kept intact), (3) a short natural-language description of what that action does. Timestamps are provided as offsets in seconds from t=0 (one second per action) to show duration/order.

Step 1  [t=0s]    Consonant agent: (cons-unstack j b) — Pick up block J from on top of block B (unstack J from B).

Step 19 [t=18s]   Consonant agent: (cons-unstack c i) — Pick up block C from on top of block I (unstack C from I).
Step 20 [t=19s]   Consonant agent: (cons-put-on-table c) — Put block C down on the table.
Step 21 [t=20s]   Consonant agent: (cons-pick-from-table h) — Pick block H up from the table.
Step 22 [t=21s]   Vowel agent: (vowel-pick-from-table i) — Vowel agent picks block I up from the table.
Step 23 [t=22s]   Vowel agent: (vowel-stack-on i j) — Vowel agent places block I on top of block J.
Step 24 [t=23s]   Consonant agent: (cons-stack-on h i) — Consonant agent places block H on top of block I.

PROBLEM
------------------------------
Two agents are tasked with manipulating blocks arranged in stacks on a table, from one configuration to another. Each block is uniquely labelled by a letter. Both agents can only interact with blocks at the top of each stack, and only interact with one block at a time. Additionally, one agent can only interact with vowel blocks, and the other can only interact with consonant blocks. Initially there are blocks D, A, F, L, K, N, B, H, I, M, G, E, C, J. D is on the table, A is on top of D, F is on top of A, L is on top of F, K is on top of L, N is on top of K, B is on top of N, H is on the table, I is on top of B, M is on top of H, G is on top of M, E is on top of G, C is on top of E, J is on top of C. The goal is to have A is on top of B, B is on top of C, C is on top of D, D is on top of E, E is on top of F, F is on top of G, G is on top of H, H is on top of I, I is on top of J, J is on top of K, K is on top of L, L is on top of M, M is on top of N, N is on the table.

NATURAL-PLAN sas_plan_0
------------------------------
Below is a step-by-step, human-readable execution of the provided PDDL plan. Each step matches the plan exactly (no actions added or removed). I report a simple timestamp assuming each action takes 1 second (start t = 0s). Agent names follow the specification: vowel_agent (v_ actions — can move A, E, I) and consonant_agent (c_ actions — moves consonants).

Step 1 — t = 0s (duration 1s): vowel_agent moves I from on top of B to on top of J.
Step 2 — t = 1s (duration 1s): consonant_agent moves B from on top of N to on top of I.
Step 3 — t = 2s (duration 1s): consonant_agent moves N from on top of K to the table.
Step 4 — t = 3s (duration 1s): consonant_agent moves B from on top of I to the table.

PROBLEM
------------------------------
Two agents are tasked with manipulating blocks arranged in stacks on a table, from one configuration to another. Each block is uniquely labelled by a letter. Both agents can only interact with blocks at the top of each stack, and only interact with one block at a time. Additionally, one agent can only interact with vowel blocks, and the other can only interact with consonant blocks. Initially there are blocks C, H, G, F, A, D, O, M, J, B, K, I, L, E, N. C is on the table, H is on the table, G is on top of C, F is on top of G, A is on top of F, D is on top of A, O is on the table, M is on top of D, J is on top of H, B is on top of M, K is on top of B, I is on top of K, L is on top of O, E is on top of I, N is on top of J. The goal is to have A is on top of B, B is on top of C, C is on top of D, D is on top of E, E is on top of F, F is on top of G, G is on top of H, H is on top of I, I is on top of J, J is on top of K, K is on top of L, L is on top of M, M is on top of N, N is on top of O, O is on the table.

PROBLEM
------------------------------
Two agents are tasked with manipulating blocks arranged in stacks on a table, from one configuration to another. Each block is uniquely labelled by a letter. Both agents can only interact with blocks at the top of each stack, and only interact with one block at a time. Additionally, one agent can only interact with vowel blocks, and the other can only interact with consonant blocks. Initially there are blocks J, K, G, A, F, E, B, D, C, H, I. J is on the table, K is on top of J, G is on top of K, A is on top of G, F is on top of A, E is on the table, B is on top of F, D is on top of B, C is on top of D, H is on top of E, I is on top of H. The goal is to have A is on top of B, B is on top of C, C is on top of D, D is on top of E, E is on top of F, F is on top of G, G is on top of H, H is on top of I, I is on top of J, J is on top of K, K is on the table.

Both agents can only interact with blocks at the top of each stack, and only interact with one block at a time. Additionally, one agent can only interact with vowel blocks, and the other can only interact with consonant blocks. Initially there are blocks J, K, G, A, F, E, B, D, C, H, I. J is on the table, K is on top of J, G is on top of K, A is on top of G, F is on top of A, E is on the table, B is on top of F, D is on top of B, C is on top of D, H is on top of E, I is on top of H. The goal is to have A is on top of B, B is on top of C, C is on top of D, D is on top of E, E is on top of F, F is on top of G, G is on top of H, H is on top of I, I is on top of J, J is on top of K, K is on the table.",

Both agents can only interact with blocks at the top of each stack, and only interact with one block at a time. Additionally, one agent can only interact with vowel blocks, and the other can only interact with consonant blocks. Initially there are blocks J, K, G, A, F, E, B, D, C, H, I. J is on the table, K is on top of J, G is on top of K, A is on top of G, F is on top of A, E is on the table, B is on top of F, D is on top of B, C is on top of D, H is on top of E, I is on top of H. The goal is to have A is on top of B, B is on top of C, C is on top of D, D is on top of E, E is on top of F, F is on top of G, G is on top of H, H is on top of I, I is on top of J, J is on top of K, K is on the table.",

NATURAL-PLAN sas_plan_2
------------------------------
Summary: Each action below follows the given plan exactly. I show each step with a simple timestamp (each action takes 1.0 time unit) and a clear human-readable description of what the named agent does. All block names are shown in uppercase. The actions respect the agents' capabilities (vowel_agent moves only A, E, I; consonant_agent moves the other blocks).

Step 1 (t = 0.0s → 1.0s): consonant_agent unstack C from D — consonant_agent lifts C off D and is now holding C; D becomes clear.

Step 2 (t = 1.0s → 2.0s): consonant_agent put down C — consonant_agent places C onto the table and releases it (C is now on the table and clear).

Step 3 (t = 2.0s → 3.0s): consonant_agent unstack D from B — consonant_agent lifts D off B and is now holding D; B becomes clear.

Step 4 (t = 3.0s → 4.0s): consonant_agent put down D — consonant_agent places D onto the table and releases it (D is now on the table and clear).

Step 5 (t = 4.0s → 5.0s): consonant_agent unstack B from F — consonant_agent lifts B off F and is now holding B; F becomes clear.

Step 6 (t = 5.0s → 6.0s): consonant_agent put down B — consonant_agent places B onto the table and releases it (B is now on the table and clear).

Step 7 (t = 6.0s → 7.0s): consonant_agent unstack F from A — consonant_agent lifts F off A and is now holding F; A becomes clear.

Step 8 (t = 7.0s → 8.0s): vowel_agent unstack A from G — vowel_agent lifts A off G and is now holding A; G becomes clear.

Step 9 (t = 8.0s → 9.0s): consonant_agent stack F onto C — consonant_agent places the held F on top of C and releases F (F is now on C).

Step 10 (t = 9.0s → 10.0s): consonant_agent unstack G from K — consonant_agent lifts G off K and is now holding G; K becomes clear.

Step 11 (t = 10.0s → 11.0s): consonant_agent stack G onto D — consonant_agent places the held G on top of D and releases G (G is now on D).

Step 12 (t = 11.0s → 12.0s): consonant_agent unstack K from J — consonant_agent lifts K off J and is now holding K; J becomes clear.

Step 13 (t = 12.0s → 13.0s): consonant_agent put down K — consonant_agent places K onto the table and releases it (K is now on the table and clear).

Step 14 (t = 13.0s → 14.0s): consonant_agent pick up J from the table — consonant_agent lifts J from the table and is now holding J (J is no longer on the table).

Step 15 (t = 14.0s → 15.0s): consonant_agent stack J onto K — consonant_agent places the held J on top of K and releases J (J is now on K).

Step 16 (t = 15.0s → 16.0s): vowel_agent stack A onto B — vowel_agent places the held A on top of B and releases A (A is now on B).

Step 17 (t = 16.0s → 17.0s): vowel_agent unstack I from H — vowel_agent lifts I off H and is now holding I; H becomes clear.

Step 18 (t = 17.0s → 18.0s): consonant_agent unstack H from E — consonant_agent lifts H off E and is now holding H; E becomes clear.

Step 19 (t = 18.0s → 19.0s): vowel_agent stack I onto J — vowel_agent places the held I on top of J and releases I (I is now on J).

Step 20 (t = 19.0s → 20.0s): vowel_agent pick up E from the table — vowel_agent lifts E from the table and is now holding E (E is no longer on the table).

Step 21 (t = 20.0s → 21.0s): consonant_agent stack H onto I — consonant_agent places the held H on top of I and releases H (H is now on I).

Step 22 (t = 21.0s → 22.0s): consonant_agent unstack G from D — consonant_agent lifts G off D and is now holding G; D becomes clear.

Step 23 (t = 22.0s → 23.0s): consonant_agent stack G onto H — consonant_agent places the held G on top of H and releases G (G is now on H).

Step 24 (t = 23.0s → 24.0s): consonant_agent unstack F from C — consonant_agent lifts F off C and is now holding F; C becomes clear.

Step 25 (t = 24.0s → 25.0s): consonant_agent stack F onto G — consonant_agent places the held F on top of G and releases F (F is now on G).

Step 26 (t = 25.0s → 26.0s): consonant_agent pick up D from the table — consonant_agent lifts D from the table and is now holding D (D is no longer on the table).

Step 27 (t = 26.0s → 27.0s): vowel_agent stack E onto F — vowel_agent places the held E on top of F and releases E (E is now on F).

Step 28 (t = 27.0s → 28.0s): consonant_agent stack D onto E — consonant_agent places the held D on top of E and releases D (D is now on E).

Step 29 (t = 28.0s → 29.0s): consonant_agent pick up C from the table — consonant_agent lifts C from the table and is now holding C (C is no longer on the table).

Step 30 (t = 29.0s → 30.0s): consonant_agent stack C onto D — consonant_agent places the held C on top of D and releases C (C is now on D).

Step 31 (t = 30.0s → 31.0s): vowel_agent unstack A from B — vowel_agent lifts A off B and is now holding A; B becomes clear.

Step 32 (t = 31.0s → 32.0s): consonant_agent pick up B from the table — consonant_agent lifts B from the table and is now holding B (B is no longer on the table).

Step 33 (t = 32.0s → 33.0s): consonant_agent stack B onto C — consonant_agent places the held B on top of C and releases B (B is now on C).

Step 34 (t = 33.0s → 34.0s): vowel_agent stack A onto B — vowel_agent places the held A on top of B and releases A (A is now on B).

Result (t = 34.0s): Goal achieved. Final tower (bottom → top) is:
- K (on table)
- J on K
- I on J
- H on I
- G on H
- F on G
- E on F
- D on E
- C on D
- B on C
- A on B

Total actions: 34 (cost = 34).

PROBLEM
------------------------------
Two agents are tasked with manipulating blocks arranged in stacks on a table, from one configuration to another. Each block is uniquely labelled by a letter. Both agents can only interact with blocks at the top of each stack, and only interact with one block at a time. Additionally, one agent can only interact with vowel blocks, and the other can only interact with consonant blocks. Initially there are blocks H, D, J, A, E, F, I, G, C, B. H is on the table, D is on top of H, J is on the table, A is on top of D, E is on top of J, F is on top of E, I is on top of F, G is on top of I, C is on top of A, B is on top of G. The goal is to have A is on top of B, B is on top of C, C is on top of D, D is on top of E, E is on top of F, F is on top of G, G is on top of H, H is on top of I, I is on top of J, J is on the table.

It is important that you keep the actions of the two agents distinct. Think step by step and provide a PDDL domain and a PDDL problem file for FastDownwards to solve the task. Enclose the pddl domain between <domain></domain> tags and the pddl problem between <problem></problem> tags."

    "human_specification": "Two agents are tasked with manipulating blocks arranged in stacks on a table, from one configuration to another. Each block is uniquely labelled by a letter. Both agents can only interact with blocks at the top of each stack, and only interact with one block at a time. Additionally, one agent can only interact with vowel blocks, and the other can only interact with consonant blocks. Initially there are blocks H, D, J, A, E, F, I, G, C, B. H is on the table, D is on top of H, J is on the table, A is on top of D, E is on top of J, F is on top of E, I is on top of F, G is on top of I, C is on top of A, B is on top of G. The goal is to have A is on top of B, B is on top of C, C is on top of D, D is on top of E, E is on top of F, F is on top of G, G is on top of H, H is on top of I, I is on top of J, J is on the table.",

Both agents can only interact with blocks at the top of each stack, and only interact with one block at a time. Additionally, one agent can only interact with vowel blocks, and the other can only interact with consonant blocks. Initially there are blocks H, D, J, A, E, F, I, G, C, B. H is on the table, D is on top of H, J is on the table, A is on top of D, E is on top of J, F is on top of E, I is on top of F, G is on top of I, C is on top of A, B is on top of G. The goal is to have A is on top of B, B is on top of C, C is on top of D, D is on top of E, E is on top of F, F is on top of G, G is on top of H, H is on top of I, I is on top of J, J is on the table.",

Both agents can only interact with blocks at the top of each stack, and only interact with one block at a time. Additionally, one agent can only interact with vowel blocks, and the other can only interact with consonant blocks. Initially there are blocks H, D, J, A, E, F, I, G, C, B.

Both agents can only interact with blocks at the top of each stack, and only interact with one block at a time. Additionally, one agent can only interact with vowel blocks, and the other can only interact with consonant blocks. Initially there are blocks H, D, J, A, E, F, I, G, C, B. H is on the table, D is on top of H, J is on the table, A is on top of D, E is on top of J, F is on top of E, I is on top of F, G is on top of I, C is on top of A, B is on top of G. The goal is to have A is on top of B, B is on top of C, C is on top of D, D is on top of E, E is on top of F, F is on top of G, G is on top of H, H is on top of I, I is on top of J, J is on the table.",

    "human_specification": "Two agents are tasked with manipulating blocks arranged in stacks on a table, from one configuration to another. Each block is uniquely labelled by a letter. Both agents can only interact with blocks at the top of each stack, and only interact with one block at a time. Additionally, one agent can only interact with vowel blocks, and the other can only interact with consonant blocks. Initially there are blocks H, D, J, A, E, F, I, G, C, B. H is on the table, D is on top of H, J is on the table, A is on top of D, E is on top of J, F is on top of E, I is on top of F, G is on top of I, C is on top of A, B is on top of G. The goal is to have A is on top of B, B is on top of C, C is on top of D, D is on top of E, E is on top of F, F is on top of G, G is on top of H, H is on top of I, I is on top of J, J is on the table.",

15. t=14s (duration 1s): Consonant agent moves block B from B onto block C.
16. t=15s (duration 1s): Vowel agent moves block A from A onto block B.
17. t=16s (duration 1s): Vowel agent moves block E from F onto block E.
18. t=17s (duration 1s): Consonant agent moves block F from G onto block F.
19. t=18s (duration 1s): Vowel agent moves block E from E onto block F.

PROBLEM
------------------------------
Two agents are tasked with manipulating blocks arranged in stacks on a table, from one configuration to another. Each block is uniquely labelled by a letter. Both agents can only interact with blocks at the top of each stack, and only interact with one block at a time. Additionally, one agent can only interact with vowel blocks, and the other can only interact with consonant blocks. Initially there are blocks J, A, G, K, F, C, H, D, E, I, B. J is on the table, A is on the table, G is on top of A, K is on top of J, F is on top of K, C is on top of G, H is on top of F, D is on top of H, E is on top of C, I is on top of E, B is on top of I. The goal is to have A is on top of B, B is on top of C, C is on top of D, D is on top of E, E is on top of F, F is on top of G, G is on top of H, H is on top of I, I is on top of J, J is on top of K, K is on the table.

PROBLEM
------------------------------
Two agents are tasked with manipulating blocks arranged in stacks on a table, from one configuration to another. Each block is uniquely labelled by a letter. Both agents can only interact with blocks at the top of each stack, and only interact with one block at a time. Additionally, one agent can only interact with vowel blocks, and the other can only interact with consonant blocks. Initially there are blocks L, K, M, A, H, C, E, G, J, N, I, F, D, B. L is on the table, K is on the table, M is on top of L, A is on top of M, H is on top of K, C is on top of H, E is on top of A, G is on top of C, J is on top of G, N is on top of E, I is on top of J, F is on top of N, D is on top of I, B is on top of F. The goal is to have A is on top of B, B is on top of C, C is on top of D, D is on top of E, E is on top of F, F is on top of G, G is on top of H, H is on top of I, I is on top of J, J is on top of K, K is on top of L, L is on top of M, M is on top of N, N is on the table.
