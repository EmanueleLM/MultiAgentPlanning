Plan (step-by-step, matching the provided plan exactly). Each step uses 1 time unit. Time shown as [start — end).

Step 1 [0 — 1): consonant_agent moves block J from on K to on H.
  - Action: consonant_agent-move-from-block-to-block(consonant_agent, J, K, H)
  - Preconditions satisfied: J was top of K, H was clear, J is a consonant and consonant_agent is allowed to move it.
  - Result: J is now on H; K becomes clear.

Step 2 [1 — 2): consonant_agent moves block K from on A to the table.
  - Action: consonant_agent-move-from-block-to-table(consonant_agent, K, A)
  - Preconditions satisfied: K was top of A, K is a consonant and consonant_agent may move it.
  - Result: K is now on the table; A becomes clear.

Step 3 [2 — 3): vowel_agent moves block A from on L to the table.
  - Action: vowel_agent-move-from-block-to-table(vowel_agent, A, L)
  - Preconditions satisfied: A was top of L, A is a vowel and vowel_agent may move it.
  - Result: A is now on the table; L becomes clear.

Step 4 [3 — 4): consonant_agent moves block L from on C to the table.
  - Action: consonant_agent-move-from-block-to-table(consonant_agent, L, C)
  - Preconditions satisfied: L was top of C, L is a consonant and consonant_agent may move it.
  - Result: L is now on the table; C becomes clear.

Step 5 [4 — 5): consonant_agent moves block K from the table onto L.
  - Action: consonant_agent-move-from-table-to-block(consonant_agent, K, L)
  - Preconditions satisfied: K is on the table, K is a consonant, L is clear and a valid target.
  - Result: K is now on L; L is no longer clear.

Step 6 [5 — 6): consonant_agent moves block J from on H to on K.
  - Action: consonant_agent-move-from-block-to-block(consonant_agent, J, H, K)
  - Preconditions satisfied: J was top of H, J is a consonant, target K is clear.
  - Result: J is now on K; H becomes clear.

Step 7 [6 — 7): vowel_agent moves block I from on G to on J.
  - Action: vowel_agent-move-from-block-to-block(vowel_agent, I, G, J)
  - Preconditions satisfied: I was top of G, I is a vowel and vowel_agent may move it, J was clear.
  - Result: I is now on J; G becomes clear.

Step 8 [7 — 8): consonant_agent moves block H from on E to on I.
  - Action: consonant_agent-move-from-block-to-block(consonant_agent, H, E, I)
  - Preconditions satisfied: H was top of E, H is a consonant and consonant_agent may move it, I was clear.
  - Result: H is now on I; E becomes clear.

Step 9 [8 — 9): consonant_agent moves block G from on F to on H.
  - Action: consonant_agent-move-from-block-to-block(consonant_agent, G, F, H)
  - Preconditions satisfied: G was top of F, G is a consonant and consonant_agent may move it, H was clear.
  - Result: G is now on H; F becomes clear.

Step 10 [9 — 10): consonant_agent moves block F from the table onto G.
  - Action: consonant_agent-move-from-table-to-block(consonant_agent, F, G)
  - Preconditions satisfied: F is on the table, F is a consonant, G was clear.
  - Result: F is now on G; table position of F freed.

Step 11 [10 — 11): vowel_agent moves block E from on B to on F.
  - Action: vowel_agent-move-from-block-to-block(vowel_agent, E, B, F)
  - Preconditions satisfied: E was top of B, E is a vowel and vowel_agent may move it, F was clear.
  - Result: E is now on F; B becomes clear.

Step 12 [11 — 12): consonant_agent moves block B from on D to on A.
  - Action: consonant_agent-move-from-block-to-block(consonant_agent, B, D, A)
  - Preconditions satisfied: B was top of D, B is a consonant and consonant_agent may move it, A (on the table) was clear.
  - Result: B is now on A; D becomes clear.

Step 13 [12 — 13): consonant_agent moves block D from the table onto E.
  - Action: consonant_agent-move-from-table-to-block(consonant_agent, D, E)
  - Preconditions satisfied: D is on the table, D is a consonant, E was clear.
  - Result: D is now on E; table position of D freed.

Step 14 [13 — 14): consonant_agent moves block C from the table onto D.
  - Action: consonant_agent-move-from-table-to-block(consonant_agent, C, D)
  - Preconditions satisfied: C is on the table, C is a consonant, D was clear.
  - Result: C is now on D; table position of C freed.

Step 15 [14 — 15): consonant_agent moves block B from on A to on C.
  - Action: consonant_agent-move-from-block-to-block(consonant_agent, B, A, C)
  - Preconditions satisfied: B was top of A, B is a consonant, C was clear.
  - Result: B is now on C; A becomes clear.

Step 16 [15 — 16): vowel_agent moves block A from the table onto B.
  - Action: vowel_agent-move-from-table-to-block(vowel_agent, A, B)
  - Preconditions satisfied: A is on the table, A is a vowel and vowel_agent may move it, B was clear.
  - Result: A is now on B.
