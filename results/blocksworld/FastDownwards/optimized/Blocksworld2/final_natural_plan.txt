Step 1 — time 0.0 → 1.0 (duration 1.0, cost = 1)
- Action (as in plan): vowel-move-from-table-to-block A B
- Agent: vowel_agent (can move only vowel blocks A, E, I)
- Description: The vowel agent picks up block A from the table and places it on top of block B.
- Preconditions checked before the move:
  - A is a vowel block (allowed for this agent).
  - A is on the table.
  - A is clear (top of its stack).
  - B is clear (top of its stack).
- Effects after the move:
  - A is no longer on the table.
  - A is now on B.
  - B is no longer clear (A is on top of it).
  - A is clear (now the top of its new stack).
- Notes: This single move, together with the initial configuration (B on C, C on D, …, I on J, J on the table), achieves the overall goal:
  - A on B; B on C; C on D; D on E; E on F; F on G; G on H; H on I; I on J; J on the table.
