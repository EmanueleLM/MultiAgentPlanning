Plan (total cost = 2; each action cost = 1, assumed duration = 1 time unit)

1) Time 0.0 → 1.0 (duration 1)
   Action: vowel_agent — pick-vowel-from-table A
   - Description: The vowel agent picks up block A from the table.
   - Preconditions satisfied: A is on the table and clear; vowel agent's hand is free.
   - Effects: A is no longer on the table; vowel agent is now holding A (hand is not free).

2) Time 1.0 → 2.0 (duration 1)
   Action: vowel_agent — put-vowel-on A B
   - Description: The vowel agent places block A onto block B.
   - Preconditions satisfied: vowel agent is holding A; B is clear.
   - Effects: A is on B; A becomes clear; B is no longer clear; vowel agent's hand becomes free.

Result after step 2:
- Goal achieved: A on B, B on C, C on D, D on E, and E on the table.
- Constraints respected: only the vowel agent manipulated a vowel block (A); only top blocks were moved; actions and costs match the provided plan.
