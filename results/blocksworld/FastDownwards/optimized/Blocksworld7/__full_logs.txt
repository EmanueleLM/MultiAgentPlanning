PROBLEM
------------------------------
Two agents are tasked with manipulating blocks arranged in stacks on a table, from one configuration to another. Each block is uniquely labelled by a letter. Both agents can only interact with blocks at the top of each stack, and only interact with one block at a time. Additionally, one agent can only interact with vowel blocks, and the other can only interact with consonant blocks. Initially there are blocks L, J, H, I, G, K, B, E, F, C, D, A. L is on the table, J is on the table, H is on top of L, I is on the table, G is on top of H, K is on top of J, B is on top of I, E is on top of B, F is on top of E, C is on top of K, D is on top of C, A is on top of G. The goal is to have A is on top of B, B is on top of C, C is on top of D, D is on top of E, E is on top of F, F is on top of G, G is on top of H, H is on top of I, I is on top of J, J is on top of K, K is on top of L, L is on the table.

NATURAL-PLAN sas_plan_0
------------------------------
Summary: two actions (unit cost each) execute in order and achieve the goal tower A on B on C on D on E on F on G on H on I on J (J on table).

1) Step 1 — Time 0.0 → 1.0 (duration 1.0 unit)
- Agent: consonant_agent
- Action: consonant_move-from-table-to-block
- Parameters: move block B from the table onto block C
- Preconditions (checked and satisfied at time 0.0):
  - B is on the table (ontable B)
  - B is clear (clear B)
  - C is clear (clear C)
  - B and C are consonant-labeled blocks (allowed for consonant_agent)
- Effects (applied at time 1.0):
  - B is no longer on the table (not ontable B)
  - B is now on C (on B C)
  - C is no longer clear (not clear C)
  - B is clear (clear B)
- State after step 1 (relevant facts):
  - on B C
  - clear B
  - not clear C
  - B not on table

2) Step 2 — Time 1.0 → 2.0 (duration 1.0 unit)
- Agent: vowel_agent
- Action: vowel_move-from-table-to-block
- Parameters: move block A from the table onto block B
- Preconditions (checked and satisfied at time 1.0):
  - A is on the table (ontable A)
  - A is clear (clear A)
  - B is clear (clear B) — satisfied because Step 1 left B clear
  - A is vowel-labeled (allowed for vowel_agent)
- Effects (applied at time 2.0):
  - A is no longer on the table (not ontable A)
  - A is now on B (on A B)
  - B is no longer clear (not clear B)
  - A is clear (clear A)
- State after step 2 (relevant facts):
  - on A B
  - on B C
  - clear A
  - not clear B
  - not clear C

Final check (time 2.0): The full goal is satisfied because the tower now has A on B, B on C, and the original stack C on D on E on F on G on H on I on J remains unchanged, with J on the table. Thus the goal A on B, B on C, C on D, D on E, E on F, F on G, G on H, H on I, I on J, and J on table is achieved.
================================================================================

PROBLEM
------------------------------
Two agents are tasked with manipulating blocks arranged in stacks on a table, from one configuration to another. Each block is uniquely labelled by a letter. Both agents can only interact with blocks at the top of each stack, and only interact with one block at a time. Additionally, one agent can only interact with vowel blocks, and the other can only interact with consonant blocks. Initially there are blocks M, C, B, G, E, N, J, L, F, I, K, D, A, H. M is on the table, C is on the table, B is on top of C, G is on top of B, E is on top of M, N is on top of E, J is on top of G, L is on top of N, F is on top of L, I is on top of J, K is on top of F, D is on top of I, A is on top of D, H is on top of A. The goal is to have A is on top of B, B is on top of C, C is on top of D, D is on top of E, E is on top of F, F is on top of G, G is on top of H, H is on top of I, I is on top of J, J is on top of K, K is on top of L, L is on top of M, M is on top of N, N is on the table.

Both agents can only interact with blocks at the top of each stack, and only interact with one block at a time. Additionally, one agent can only interact with vowel blocks, and the other can only interact with consonant blocks. Initially there are blocks M, C, B, G, E, N, J, L, F, I, K, D, A, H. M is on the table, C is on the table, B is on top of C, G is on top of B, E is on top of M, N is on top of E, J is on top of G, L is on top of N, F is on top of L, I is on top of J, K is on top of F, D is on top of I, A is on top of D, H is on top of A. The goal is to have A is on top of B, B is on top of C, C is on top of D, D is on top of E, E is on top of F, F is on top of G, G is on top of H, H is on top of I, I is on top of J, J is on top of K, K is on top of L, L is on top of M, M is on top of N, N is on the table.",

Additionally, one agent can only interact with vowel blocks, and the other can only interact with consonant blocks. Initially there are blocks M, C, B, G, E, N, J, L, F, I, K, D, A, H. M is on the table, C is on the table, B is on top of C, G is on top of B, E is on top of M, N is on top of E, J is on top of G, L is on top of N, F is on top of L, I is on top of J, K is on top of F, D is on top of I, A is on top of D, H is on top of A.

    "human_specification": "Two agents are tasked with manipulating blocks arranged in stacks on a table, from one configuration to another. Each block is uniquely labelled by a letter. Both agents can only interact with blocks at the top of each stack, and only interact with one block at a time. Additionally, one agent can only interact with vowel blocks, and the other can only interact with consonant blocks. Initially there are blocks M, C, B, G, E, N, J, L, F, I, K, D, A, H. M is on the table, C is on the table, B is on top of C, G is on top of B, E is on top of M, N is on top of E, J is on top of G, L is on top of N, F is on top of L, I is on top of J, K is on top of F, D is on top of I, A is on top of D, H is on top of A. The goal is to have A is on top of B, B is on top of C, C is on top of D, D is on top of E, E is on top of F, F is on top of G, G is on top of H, H is on top of I, I is on top of J, J is on top of K, K is on top of L, L is on top of M, M is on top of N, N is on the table.",

NATURAL-PLAN sas_plan_0
------------------------------
Step 1 — t = 0.0s → 1.0s (duration 1.0s)
- Action: vowel_agent performs "vowel-pickup A"
- What happened: vowel_agent picks up block A from the table.
- Preconditions satisfied: A was on the table, A was clear (top of its stack), vowel_agent's hand was empty, and A is a vowel (allowed for vowel_agent).
- Effects (state changes):
  - vowel_agent is now holding A.
  - A is no longer on the table and is no longer marked clear.
  - vowel_agent's hand is no longer empty.

Step 2 — t = 1.0s → 2.0s (duration 1.0s)
- Action: consonant_agent performs "cons-pickup B"
- What happened: consonant_agent picks up block B from the table.
- Preconditions satisfied: B was on the table, B was clear, consonant_agent's hand was empty, and B is a consonant (allowed for consonant_agent).
- Effects (state changes):
  - consonant_agent is now holding B.
  - B is no longer on the table and is no longer marked clear.
  - consonant_agent's hand is no longer empty.

Step 3 — t = 2.0s → 3.0s (duration 1.0s)
- Action: consonant_agent performs "cons-stack B C"
- What happened: consonant_agent places B on top of C.
- Preconditions satisfied: consonant_agent was holding B, C was clear, and B is a consonant.
- Effects (state changes):
  - B is now on C.
  - C is no longer clear.
  - B is clear (being the top of that small stack).
  - consonant_agent's hand becomes empty (no longer holding B).

Step 4 — t = 3.0s → 4.0s (duration 1.0s)
- Action: vowel_agent performs "vowel-stack A B"
- What happened: vowel_agent places A on top of B.
- Preconditions satisfied: vowel_agent was holding A, B was clear after Step 3, and A is a vowel.
- Effects (state changes):
  - A is now on B.
  - B is no longer clear.
  - A is clear (top of the tower).
  - vowel_agent's hand becomes empty (no longer holding A).

Final result (after t = 4.0s)
- The relevant part of the final tower is achieved: A on B on C on D on E on F on G on H on I on J, with J on the table.
- All actions respect agent constraints: vowel_agent only manipulated A (a vowel); consonant_agent only manipulated B (and stacked it on C, both consonants). Only top blocks were picked/placed and agents handled one block at a time.
- Total plan cost: 4 actions (unit cost per action).

PROBLEM
------------------------------
Two agents are tasked with manipulating blocks arranged in stacks on a table, from one configuration to another. Each block is uniquely labelled by a letter. Both agents can only interact with blocks at the top of each stack, and only interact with one block at a time. Additionally, one agent can only interact with vowel blocks, and the other can only interact with consonant blocks. Initially there are blocks L, F, K, C, G, H, D, B, J, E, I, A. L is on the table, F is on top of L, K is on the table, C is on top of F, G is on the table, H is on top of K, D is on top of H, B is on top of D, J is on top of B, E is on top of J, I is on the table, A is on top of I. The goal is to have A is on top of B, B is on top of C, C is on top of D, D is on top of E, E is on top of F, F is on top of G, G is on top of H, H is on top of I, I is on top of J, J is on top of K, K is on top of L, L is on the table.

Both agents can only interact with blocks at the top of each stack, and only interact with one block at a time. Additionally, one agent can only interact with vowel blocks, and the other can only interact with consonant blocks. Initially there are blocks L, F, K, C, G, H, D, B, J, E, I, A. L is on the table, F is on top of L, K is on the table, C is on top of F, G is on the table, H is on top of K, D is on top of H, B is on top of D, J is on top of B, E is on top of J, I is on the table, A is on top of I. The goal is to have A is on top of B, B is on top of C, C is on top of D, D is on top of E, E is on top of F, F is on top of G, G is on top of H, H is on top of I, I is on top of J, J is on top of K, K is on top of L, L is on the table.",

Both agents can only interact with blocks at the top of each stack, and only interact with one block at a time. Additionally, one agent can only interact with vowel blocks, and the other can only interact with consonant blocks. Initially there are blocks L, F, K, C, G, H, D, B, J, E, I, A. L is on the table, F is on top of L, K is on the table, C is on top of F, G is on the table, H is on top of K, D is on top of H, B is on top of D, J is on top of B, E is on top of J, I is on the table, A is on top of I. The goal is to have A is on top of B, B is on top of C, C is on top of D, D is on top of E, E is on top of F, F is on top of G, G is on top of H, H is on top of I, I is on top of J, J is on top of K, K is on top of L, L is on the table.",

NATURAL-PLAN sas_plan_0
------------------------------
Step 1 — time 0.0 → 1.0 (duration 1.0, cost = 1)
- Action (as in plan): vowel-move-from-table-to-block A B
- Agent: vowel_agent (can move only vowel blocks A, E, I)
- Description: The vowel agent picks up block A from the table and places it on top of block B.
- Preconditions checked before the move:
  - A is a vowel block (allowed for this agent).
  - A is on the table.
  - A is clear (top of its stack).
  - B is clear (top of its stack).
- Effects after the move:
  - A is no longer on the table.
  - A is now on B.
  - B is no longer clear (A is on top of it).
  - A is clear (now the top of its new stack).
- Notes: This single move, together with the initial configuration (B on C, C on D, …, I on J, J on the table), achieves the overall goal:
  - A on B; B on C; C on D; D on E; E on F; F on G; G on H; H on I; I on J; J on the table.
================================================================================

PROBLEM
------------------------------
Two agents are tasked with manipulating blocks arranged in stacks on a table, from one configuration to another. Each block is uniquely labelled by a letter. Both agents can only interact with blocks at the top of each stack, and only interact with one block at a time. Additionally, one agent can only interact with vowel blocks, and the other can only interact with consonant blocks. Initially there are blocks C, B, I, F, D, A, E, G, H, J. C is on the table, B is on the table, I is on top of C, F is on top of I, D is on top of B, A is on top of D, E is on top of A, G is on top of E, H is on top of G, J is on top of F. The goal is to have A is on top of B, B is on top of C, C is on top of D, D is on top of E, E is on top of F, F is on top of G, G is on top of H, H is on top of I, I is on top of J, J is on the table.

NATURAL-PLAN sas_plan_3
------------------------------
Summary: 22-step plan executed by two agents (consonant_agent and vowel_agent). Each step duration: 1 time unit. Start time = 0.0. End time = 22.0. Blocks labeled A–J (lowercase in PDDL: a..j). The agents respect their restrictions: consonant_agent moves consonant blocks (B,C,D,F,G,H,J) and vowel_agent moves vowel blocks (A,E,I).

Steps (timestamp start -> end; agent; action; human-readable description):

1. t=0.0 -> 1.0; consonant_agent; cons_unstack j f
   - Unstack J from on top of F (consonant_agent picks up J from F).

2. t=1.0 -> 2.0; consonant_agent; cons_putdown j

PROBLEM
------------------------------
Two agents are tasked with manipulating blocks arranged in stacks on a table, from one configuration to another. Each block is uniquely labelled by a letter. Both agents can only interact with blocks at the top of each stack, and only interact with one block at a time. Additionally, one agent can only interact with vowel blocks, and the other can only interact with consonant blocks. Initially there are blocks D, A, K, J, C, F, G, I, E, H, B. D is on the table, A is on the table, K is on top of D, J is on the table, C is on top of J, F is on top of C, G is on top of F, I is on the table, E is on top of I, H is on top of K, B is on top of A. The goal is to have A is on top of B, B is on top of C, C is on top of D, D is on top of E, E is on top of F, F is on top of G, G is on top of H, H is on top of I, I is on top of J, J is on top of K, K is on the table.

You have to orchestrate them to solve the following task: {agents->orchestrator->goal} Keep in mind that the PDDL they send you may be partial or contain ambiguities. A partial PDDL may partially solve a planning problem but may require integrating additional information from the other PDDL to achieve the goal. Ambiguities may appear in different forms for example two PDDL problems may refer to the same object with different names. Here is the information the first agent has and its PDDL response: {pddl_vowel_agent} Here is the information the second agent has and its PDDL response: {pddl_consonant_agent} You need to integrate the PDDL responses of the two agents to solve the task. It is very important that you keep the actions of the two agents distinct and that the final PDDL targets the FastDownward solver. Think step by step and provide a PDDL domain and a PDDL problem file. Enclose the PDDL domain between <domain></domain> tags and the PDDL problem between <problem></problem> tags."

NATURAL-PLAN sas_plan_0
------------------------------
Step 1 — t = 0 → 1 (duration 1, cost = 1)
- Agent: vowel_agent
- Action: Move block A from the table onto block B.
- Rationale / Preconditions (checked): A is a vowel and is on the table and clear; B is clear; A ≠ B — so the action vowel_move-table-to-block a b is allowed.
- Effects (resulting facts): A is no longer on the table and is now on B (on A B); B is no longer clear; A is clear (top).
- Compliance: Only a vowel block (A) was moved by the vowel_agent, and only top blocks were manipulated, matching the specification.
- Goal status after step: The goal stack A on B on C on D on E on F on G on H on I on J (with J on the table) is achieved.
================================================================================

PROBLEM
------------------------------
Two agents are tasked with manipulating blocks arranged in stacks on a table, from one configuration to another. Each block is uniquely labelled by a letter. Both agents can only interact with blocks at the top of each stack, and only interact with one block at a time. Additionally, one agent can only interact with vowel blocks, and the other can only interact with consonant blocks. Initially there are blocks I, B, L, A, F, H, D, G, C, E, K, J. I is on the table, B is on the table, L is on top of I, A is on top of B, F is on top of L, H is on top of A, D is on top of H, G is on top of F, C is on top of G, E is on top of D, K is on top of E, J is on the table. The goal is to have A is on top of B, B is on top of C, C is on top of D, D is on top of E, E is on top of F, F is on top of G, G is on top of H, H is on top of I, I is on top of J, J is on top of K, K is on top of L, L is on the table.

Both agents can only interact with blocks at the top of each stack, and only interact with one block at a time. Additionally, one agent can only interact with vowel blocks, and the other can only interact with consonant blocks. Initially there are blocks I, B, L, A, F, H, D, G, C, E, K, J. I is on the table, B is on the table, L is on top of I, A is on top of B, F is on top of L, H is on top of A, D is on top of H, G is on top of F, C is on top of G, E is on top of D, K is on top of E, J is on the table. The goal is to have A is on top of B, B is on top of C, C is on top of D, D is on top of E, E is on top of F, F is on top of G, G is on top of H, H is on top of I, I is on top of J, J is on top of K, K is on top of L, L is on the table.",

PROBLEM
------------------------------
Two agents are tasked with manipulating blocks arranged in stacks on a table, from one configuration to another. Each block is uniquely labelled by a letter. Both agents can only interact with blocks at the top of each stack, and only interact with one block at a time. Additionally, one agent can only interact with vowel blocks, and the other can only interact with consonant blocks. Initially there are blocks A, C, I, D, L, K, E, H, F, G, J, B. A is on the table, C is on the table, I is on top of A, D is on top of C, L is on top of I, K is on top of L, E is on top of K, H is on top of D, F is on top of E, G is on top of H, J is on top of G, B is on top of J. The goal is to have A is on top of B, B is on top of C, C is on top of D, D is on top of E, E is on top of F, F is on top of G, G is on top of H, H is on top of I, I is on top of J, J is on top of K, K is on top of L, L is on the table.

PROBLEM
------------------------------
Two agents are tasked with manipulating blocks arranged in stacks on a table, from one configuration to another. Each block is uniquely labelled by a letter. Both agents can only interact with blocks at the top of each stack, and only interact with one block at a time. Additionally, one agent can only interact with vowel blocks, and the other can only interact with consonant blocks. Initially there are blocks H, L, B, K, C, A, J, E, I, D, G, F. H is on the table, L is on the table, B is on top of H, K is on the table, C is on top of B, A is on the table, J is on top of L, E is on top of C, I is on top of J, D is on top of K, G is on top of D, F is on top of E. The goal is to have A is on top of B, B is on top of C, C is on top of D, D is on top of E, E is on top of F, F is on top of G, G is on top of H, H is on top of I, I is on top of J, J is on top of K, K is on top of L, L is on the table.

Both agents can only interact with blocks at the top of each stack, and only interact with one block at a time. Additionally, one agent can only interact with vowel blocks, and the other can only interact with consonant blocks. Initially there are blocks H, L, B, K, C, A, J, E, I, D, G, F. H is on the table, L is on the table, B is on top of H, K is on the table, C is on top of B, A is on the table, J is on top of L, E is on top of C, I is on top of J, D is on top of K, G is on top of D, F is on top of E. The goal is to have A is on top of B, B is on top of C, C is on top of D, D is on top of E, E is on top of F, F is on top of G, G is on top of H, H is on top of I, I is on top of J, J is on top of K, K is on top of L, L is on the table.",

Both agents can only interact with blocks at the top of each stack, and only interact with one block at a time. Additionally, one agent can only interact with vowel blocks, and the other can only interact with consonant blocks. Initially there are blocks H, L, B, K, C, A, J, E, I, D, G, F. H is on the table, L is on the table, B is on top of H, K is on the table, C is on top of B, A is on the table, J is on top of L, E is on top of C, I is on top of J, D is on top of K, G is on top of D, F is on top of E. The goal is to have A is on top of B, B is on top of C, C is on top of D, D is on top of E, E is on top of F, F is on top of G, G is on top of H, H is on top of I, I is on top of J, J is on top of K, K is on top of L, L is on the table.",

28. t=27.0–28.0 (duration 1.0) — consonant_agent stacks J onto K. (stack-consonant consonant_agent J K)

Final status: the actions above achieve the target stack with L on the table and K, J, I, H, G, F, E, D, C, B, A stacked above in that order (goal achieved).
