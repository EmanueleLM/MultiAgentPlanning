PROBLEM
------------------------------
Two agents are tasked with manipulating blocks arranged in stacks on a table, from one configuration to another. Each block is uniquely labelled by a letter. Both agents can only interact with blocks at the top of each stack, and only interact with one block at a time. Additionally, one agent can only interact with vowel blocks, and the other can only interact with consonant blocks. Initially there are blocks L, J, H, I, G, K, B, E, F, C, D, A. L is on the table, J is on the table, H is on top of L, I is on the table, G is on top of H, K is on top of J, B is on top of I, E is on top of B, F is on top of E, C is on top of K, D is on top of C, A is on top of G. The goal is to have A is on top of B, B is on top of C, C is on top of D, D is on top of E, E is on top of F, F is on top of G, G is on top of H, H is on top of I, I is on top of J, J is on top of K, K is on top of L, L is on the table.

Both agents can only interact with blocks at the top of each stack, and only interact with one block at a time. Additionally, one agent can only interact with vowel blocks, and the other can only interact with consonant blocks. Initially there are blocks L, J, H, I, G, K, B, E, F, C, D, A. L is on the table, J is on the table, H is on top of L, I is on the table, G is on top of H, K is on top of J, B is on top of I, E is on top of B, F is on top of E, C is on top of K, D is on top of C, A is on top of G. The goal is to have A is on top of B, B is on top of C, C is on top of D, D is on top of E, E is on top of F, F is on top of G, G is on top of H, H is on top of I, I is on top of J, J is on top of K, K is on top of L, L is on the table.",

NATURAL-PLAN sas_plan_5
------------------------------
Below is a human-readable, step-by-step trace of the provided plan. Each step matches exactly one action in the plan (same order, same agent, same parameters). I show a timestamp for each action, assuming each action takes 1 second (start t=00:00:00). Block labels are shown in uppercase to match the problem specification.

Total actions: 51. Total assumed duration: 51 seconds.

00:00:00 — Step 01: vowel_agent moves block A from G onto A.
00:00:01 — Step 02: consonant_agent moves block D from C onto D.
00:00:02 — Step 03: consonant_agent moves block C from K onto D.
00:00:03 — Step 04: consonant_agent moves block F from E onto G.
00:00:04 — Step 05: vowel_agent moves block E from B onto F.
00:00:05 — Step 06: consonant_agent moves block B from I onto C.
00:00:06 — Step 07: vowel_agent moves block A from A onto B.
00:00:07 — Step 08: consonant_agent moves block K from J onto K.
00:00:08 — Step 09: consonant_agent moves block J from the table onto K.
