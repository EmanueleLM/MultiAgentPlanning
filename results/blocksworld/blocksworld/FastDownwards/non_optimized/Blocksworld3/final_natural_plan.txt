Below is a step-by-step, human-readable rendition of the provided PDDL plan. Each step exactly matches one action from the plan in order, identifies the agent performing it (consonant_agent or vowel_agent), gives a short plain-English description of the operation, reports a timestamp (starting at t=0s) and a duration of 1s per action, and states the immediate effect on the blocks involved.

Summary assumptions:
- Time starts at t = 0s; each action takes 1s (so step N occurs at t = N-1 s and completes at t = N s).
- Block labels are shown uppercase for readability (plan used lowercase); e.g., a -> A, b -> B, etc.
- "Unstack X from Y" means X was on Y; agent picks up X and Y becomes clear.
- "Pickup-from-table X" means agent picks X up from the table.
- "Putdown-to-table X" means agent puts X down onto the table (X becomes ontable and clear).
- "Stack X onto Y" means agent places X on top of Y (Y is no longer clear).

If you want, I can (1) display the intermediate stack configuration after each step, (2) verify agent constraints against the original JSON spec (which lists vowels as A and E) and highlight any mismatches, or (3) produce a compact timeline grouped by agent concurrency assumptions. Which would you prefer next?
