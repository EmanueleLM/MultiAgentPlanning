Both agents can only interact with blocks at the top of each stack, and only interact with one block at a time. Additionally, one agent can only interact with vowel blocks, and the other can only interact with consonant blocks. Initially there are blocks L, J, H, I, G, K, B, E, F, C, D, A. L is on the table, J is on the table, H is on top of L, I is on the table, G is on top of H, K is on top of J, B is on top of I, E is on top of B, F is on top of E, C is on top of K, D is on top of C, A is on top of G.

    "response": "Yes \u2014 this is achievable. Below is a concrete sequence of moves that respects:\n- only top blocks can be moved,\n- each move moves exactly one block,\n- the Vowel-agent moves only A, E, I; the Consonant-agent moves the other letters,\n- any number of new table stacks (temporary table spots) may be created.\n\nNotation:\n- Initial table stacks:\n  S1 = [L, H, G, A] (bottom\u2192top)\n  S2 = [J, K, C, D]\n  S3 = [I, B, E, F]\n- I will create temporary table stacks T1, T2, \u2026 as needed.\n- Each move is labelled with the agent (Vowel or Consonant), the block moved, source stack \u2192 destination stack.\n\nMove list (1..27):\n\n1. Consonant: D from S2 \u2192 T1.  \n   (T1 = [D]; S2 = [J,K,C])\n\n2. Consonant: C from S2 \u2192 on top of D at T1.  \n   (T1 = [D,C]; S2 = [J,K])\n\n3.

Consonant: K from S2 \u2192 on top of L at S1.  \n   (S1 = [L,K]; S2 = [J])\n\n7. Consonant: J from S2 \u2192 on top of K at S1.  \n   (S1 = [L,K,J]; S2 empty)\n\n8. Consonant: F from S3 \u2192 on top of G at T3.  \n   (T3 = [G,F]; S3 = [I,B,E])\n\n9. Vowel: E from S3 \u2192 on top of F at T3.  \n   (T3 = [G,F,E]; S3 = [I,B])\n\n10. Consonant: C from T1 \u2192 T5 (temporary).  \n    (T5 = [C]; T1 = [D])\n\n11. Consonant: D from T1 \u2192 on top of E at T3.  \n    (T3 = [G,F,E,D]; T1 now empty)\n\n12.

Consonant: H from T4 \u2192 on top of I at S1.  \n    (S1 = [L,K,J,I,H]; T4 empty)\n\nNow T3 = [G,F,E,D,C,B] (bottom\u2192top). We need G \u2192 H \u2192 ... final order, so we will temporarily move the top blocks of T3 off so we can move the bottom G onto H, then put the others back in correct order.\n\n16. Consonant: B from T3 \u2192 T6.  \n    (T6 = [B]; T3 = [G,F,E,D,C])\n\n17. Consonant: C from T3 \u2192 T7.  \n    (T7 = [C]; T3 = [G,F,E,D])\n\n18. Consonant: D from T3 \u2192 T8.  \n    (T8 = [D]; T3 = [G,F,E])\n\n19. Vowel: E from T3 \u2192 T9.  \n    (T9 = [E]; T3 = [G,F])\n\n20. Consonant: F from T3 \u2192 T10.  \n    (T10 = [F]; T3 = [G])\n\n21. Consonant: G from T3 \u2192 on top of H at S1.  \n    (S1 = [L,K,J,I,H,G]; T3 empty)\n\n22. Consonant: F from T10 \u2192 on top of G at S1.  \n    (S1 = [L,K,J,I,H,G,F]; T10 empty)\n\n23. Vowel: E from T9 \u2192 on top of F at S1.  \n    (S1 = [L,K,J,I,H,G,F,E]; T9 empty)\n\n24. Consonant: D from T8 \u2192 on top of E at S1.  \n    (S1 = [L,K,J,I,H,G,F,E,D]; T8 empty)\n\n25. Consonant: C from T7 \u2192 on top of D at S1.  \n    (S1 = [L,K,J,I,H,G,F,E,D,C]; T7 empty)\n\n26. Consonant: B from T6 \u2192 on top of C at S1.  \n    (S1 = [L,K,J,I,H,G,F,E,D,C,B]; T6 empty)\n\n27. Vowel: A from T2 \u2192 on top of B at S1.  \n    (S1 = [L,K,J,I,H,G,F,E,D,C,B,A]; T2 empty)\n\nAfter move 27, S1 is exactly the goal stack (bottom\u2192top):\nL, K, J, I, H, G, F, E, D, C, B, A\nwhich matches the requested goal: L on the table, K on L, J on K, I on J, H on I, G on H, F on G, E on F, D on E, C on D, B on C, A on B.\n\nAll moves respect top-only access and the vowel/consonant move restrictions. Consonant-agent performed all consonant moves; vowel-agent performed only moves of A, E, I."
