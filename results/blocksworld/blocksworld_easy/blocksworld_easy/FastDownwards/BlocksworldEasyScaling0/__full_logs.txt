PROBLEM
------------------------------
I am playing with a set of blocks where I need to arrange the blocks into stacks. Here are the actions I can do

Pick up a block
Unstack a block from on top of another block
Put down a block
Stack a block on top of another block

I have the following restrictions on my actions:
I can only pick up or unstack one block at a time.
I can only pick up or unstack a block if my hand is empty.
I can only pick up a block if the block is on the table and the block is clear. A block is clear if the block has no other blocks on top of it and if the block is not picked up.
I can only unstack a block from on top of another block if the block I am unstacking was really on top of the other block.
I can only unstack a block from on top of another block if the block I am unstacking is clear.
Once I pick up or unstack a block, I am holding the block.
I can only put down a block that I am holding.
I can only stack a block on top of another block if I am holding the block being stacked.
I can only stack a block on top of another block if the block onto which I am stacking the block is clear.
Once I put down or stack a block, my hand becomes empty.
Once you stack a block on top of a second block, the second block is no longer clear.

[STATEMENT]
As initial conditions I have that, the orange block is clear, the yellow block is clear, the hand is empty, the blue block is on top of the red block, the orange block is on top of the blue block, the red block is on the table and the yellow block is on the table.
My goal is to have that the blue block is on top of the red block and the yellow block is on top of the orange block.

My plan is as follows:

NATURAL-PLAN sas_plan_1
------------------------------
This sequence of instructions translates the PDDL plan into human-readable steps to solve the 4-disk Tower of Hanoi problem, moving the entire stack from the Middle Peg (M) to the Right Peg (R).

The disks are A (smallest), B, C, D (largest). Pegs are L (Left), M (Middle), and R (Right). Each step represents one unit of time.

| Step | Time | Action Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 1 | 1 | **Move Disk A** from Disk B (on Peg M) to the empty **Peg L**. |
| 2 | 2 | **Move Disk B** from Disk C (on Peg M) to the empty **Peg R**. |
| 3 | 3 | **Move Disk A** from Peg L (where it is the base) onto **Disk B** (on Peg R). |
| 4 | 4 | **Move Disk C** from Disk D (on Peg M) to the empty **Peg L**. |
| 5 | 5 | **Move Disk A** from Disk B (on Peg R) onto **Disk D** (on Peg M). |
| 6 | 6 | **Move Disk B** from Peg R (where it is the base) onto **Disk C** (on Peg L). |
| 7 | 7 | **Move Disk A** from Disk D (on Peg M) onto **Disk B** (on Peg L). |
| 8 | 8 | **Move Disk D** from Peg M (where it is the base) to the empty **Peg R**. |
| 9 | 9 | **Move Disk A** from Disk B (on Peg L) to the empty **Peg M**. |
| 10 | 10 | **Move Disk A** from Peg M (where it is the base) onto **Disk D** (on Peg R). |
| 11 | 11 | **Move Disk B** from Disk C (on Peg L) to the empty **Peg M**. |
| 12 | 12 | **Move Disk A** from Disk D (on Peg R) onto **Disk B** (on Peg M). |
| 13 | 13 | **Move Disk C** from Peg L (where it is the base) onto **Disk D** (on Peg R). |
| 14 | 14 | **Move Disk A** from Disk B (on Peg M) to the empty **Peg L**. |
| 15 | 15 | **Move Disk B** from Peg M (where it is the base) onto **Disk C** (on Peg R). |
| 16 | 16 | **Move Disk A** from Peg L (where it is the base) onto **Disk B** (on Peg R). |
