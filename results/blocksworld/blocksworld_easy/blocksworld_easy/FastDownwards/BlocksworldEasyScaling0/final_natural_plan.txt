The following sequence of human-readable actions, derived directly from the PDDL plan, achieves the desired goal state (Blue block on Red block, and Yellow block on Orange block) from the initial configuration.

**Initial State:** A stack exists where Orange is on Blue, and Blue is on Red. The Yellow block is resting on the table.

| Step | PDDL Action | Human-Readable Instruction |
| :--- | :---------- | :------------------------- |
| 1. | `(pick-up y)` | Pick up the Yellow block from the table. |
| 2. | `(stack y o)` | Stack the Yellow block (currently held) onto the top of the Orange block. |

**Resulting State:** The Blue block remains on the Red block, and the Yellow block is now stacked on the Orange block. The goal is satisfied.
