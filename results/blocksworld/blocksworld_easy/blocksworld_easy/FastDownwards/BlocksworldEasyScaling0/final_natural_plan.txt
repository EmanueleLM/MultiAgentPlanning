This sequence of instructions translates the PDDL plan into human-readable steps to solve the 4-disk Tower of Hanoi problem, moving the entire stack from the Middle Peg (M) to the Right Peg (R).

The disks are A (smallest), B, C, D (largest). Pegs are L (Left), M (Middle), and R (Right). Each step represents one unit of time.

| Step | Time | Action Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 1 | 1 | **Move Disk A** from Disk B (on Peg M) to the empty **Peg L**. |
| 2 | 2 | **Move Disk B** from Disk C (on Peg M) to the empty **Peg R**. |
| 3 | 3 | **Move Disk A** from Peg L (where it is the base) onto **Disk B** (on Peg R). |
| 4 | 4 | **Move Disk C** from Disk D (on Peg M) to the empty **Peg L**. |
| 5 | 5 | **Move Disk A** from Disk B (on Peg R) onto **Disk D** (on Peg M). |
| 6 | 6 | **Move Disk B** from Peg R (where it is the base) onto **Disk C** (on Peg L). |
| 7 | 7 | **Move Disk A** from Disk D (on Peg M) onto **Disk B** (on Peg L). |
| 8 | 8 | **Move Disk D** from Peg M (where it is the base) to the empty **Peg R**. |
| 9 | 9 | **Move Disk A** from Disk B (on Peg L) to the empty **Peg M**. |
| 10 | 10 | **Move Disk A** from Peg M (where it is the base) onto **Disk D** (on Peg R). |
| 11 | 11 | **Move Disk B** from Disk C (on Peg L) to the empty **Peg M**. |
| 12 | 12 | **Move Disk A** from Disk D (on Peg R) onto **Disk B** (on Peg M). |
| 13 | 13 | **Move Disk C** from Peg L (where it is the base) onto **Disk D** (on Peg R). |
| 14 | 14 | **Move Disk A** from Disk B (on Peg M) to the empty **Peg L**. |
| 15 | 15 | **Move Disk B** from Peg M (where it is the base) onto **Disk C** (on Peg R). |
| 16 | 16 | **Move Disk A** from Peg L (where it is the base) onto **Disk B** (on Peg R). |
