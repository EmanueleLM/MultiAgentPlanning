This is a sequence of actions required to transfer all four disks (A, B, C, D) from the Right peg to the Left peg, following the rules of the Tower of Hanoi puzzle.

### Tower of Hanoi: 4-Disk Solution Plan

**Initial State:** All disks (A, B, C, D) are stacked on the Right peg (A is on top of B, B is on C, C is on D, D is on Right).

| Step | Time | Action | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | T+1 | (move\_to\_peg a b middle) | Move disk A (smallest) from disk B onto the Middle peg. |
| 2 | T+2 | (move\_to\_peg b c left) | Move disk B from disk C onto the Left peg. |
| 3 | T+3 | (move\_to\_disk a middle b) | Move disk A from the Middle peg onto disk B (on Left). |
| 4 | T+4 | (move\_to\_peg c d middle) | Move disk C from disk D onto the Middle peg. |
| 5 | T+5 | (move\_to\_disk a b d) | Move disk A from disk B onto disk D (on Right). |
| 6 | T+6 | (move\_to\_disk b left c) | Move disk B from the Left peg onto disk C (on Middle). |
| 7 | T+7 | (move\_to\_disk a d b) | Move disk A from disk D onto disk B (on C). |
| 8 | T+8 | (move\_to\_peg d right left) | Move the largest disk D from the Right peg onto the Left peg. |
| 9 | T+9 | (move\_to\_disk a b d) | Move disk A from disk B onto disk D (on Left). |
| 10 | T+10 | (move\_to\_peg b c right) | Move disk B from disk C onto the Right peg. |
| 11 | T+11 | (move\_to\_disk a d b) | Move disk A from disk D onto disk B (on Right). |
| 12 | T+12 | (move\_to\_disk c middle d) | Move disk C from the Middle peg onto disk D (on Left). |
| 13 | T+13 | (move\_to\_peg a b middle) | Move disk A from disk B onto the Middle peg. |
| 14 | T+14 | (move\_to\_disk b right c) | Move disk B from the Right peg onto disk C (on D). |
| 15 | T+15 | (move\_to\_disk a middle b) | Move disk A from the Middle peg onto disk B (on C). |

**Final State:** All disks (A, B, C, D) are stacked on the Left peg (A is on top of B, B is on C, C is on D, D is on Left).
**Total Actions:** 15.
