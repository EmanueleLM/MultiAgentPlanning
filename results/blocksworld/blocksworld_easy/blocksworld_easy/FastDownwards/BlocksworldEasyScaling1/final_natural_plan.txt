This is the sequence of human-readable actions required to achieve the goal state:

| Step | PDDL Action | Natural Language Instruction |
| :--- | :---------- | :--------------------------- |
| 1 | `(pick-up b)` | Pick up Block B (Blue) from the table. |
| 2 | `(stack b y)` | Place Block B (Blue) onto the top of Block Y (Yellow). |

The goal arrangement, where Block B is on Y, Y is on R, and R is on O, is now achieved. (Total cost: 2 units).
