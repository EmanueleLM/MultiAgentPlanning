This is the sequence of actions required to transform the initial block configuration into the goal state:

1.  **Unstack yellow from orange:** Lift the yellow block off the top of the orange block. (The yellow block is now held.)
2.  **Stack yellow onto red:** Place the yellow block onto the red block. (The hand is now empty.)
3.  **Pick up orange:** Lift the orange block from the table. (The orange block is now held.)
4.  **Stack orange onto blue:** Place the orange block onto the blue block. (The hand is now empty.)

The goal state is achieved: the orange block is on the blue block, and the yellow block is on the red block.
