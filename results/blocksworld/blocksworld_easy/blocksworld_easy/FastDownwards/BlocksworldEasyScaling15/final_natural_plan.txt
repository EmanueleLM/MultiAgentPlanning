The following is the sequence of human-readable actions derived from the PDDL plan, intended for the Mover agent to execute.

**Initial State Review:**
*   The blocks are currently arranged: Yellow is on Blue, Blue is on Red. Orange is on the table next to the stack.
*   Goal: Blue on Yellow, Yellow on Orange.

| Step | PDDL Action | Human Instruction for Mover |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 1 | `(unstack yellow blue)` | Unstack the **yellow** block from the **blue** block. (The Mover is now holding the yellow block.) |
| 2 | `(stack yellow orange)` | Stack the **yellow** block onto the **orange** block. |
| 3 | `(unstack blue red)` | Unstack the **blue** block from the **red** block. (The Mover is now holding the blue block.) |
| 4 | `(stack blue yellow)` | Stack the **blue** block onto the **yellow** block. |

The goal state (blue on yellow, yellow on orange) is achieved.
