This plan translates the PDDL solution for the Blocksworld instance into a sequence of human-readable instructions.

The objective is to reconfigure the blocks such that Block B is on Block R, and Block R remains on Block O.

| Step | PDDL Action | Human Instruction |
| :--- | :---------- | :---------------- |
| 1    | `(unstack b y)` | Unstack Block B from Block Y. (The agent is now holding B.) |
| 2    | `(stack b r)` | Stack Block B onto Block R. |
