This is the sequence of human-readable actions required to achieve the goal state, based exactly on the provided PDDL plan:

1.  **Unstack the Blue block from the Yellow block.**
    (The agent picks up the Blue block, which was resting on the Yellow block.)

2.  **Stack the Blue block onto the Red block.**
    (The agent places the Blue block it is holding onto the Red block.)

The final configuration is achieved: Blue is on Red, and Red remains on Orange.
