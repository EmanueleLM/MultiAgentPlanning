This plan outlines the required sequence of movements to achieve the desired block configuration.

The initial configuration is: The Blue block is stacked on the Red block, which is stacked on the Orange block (Blue/Red/Orange stack). The Yellow block rests on the table separately.

| Step | PDDL Action | Human Instruction |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 1 | `(pick-up yellow)` | Pick up the Yellow block from the table. |
| 2 | `(stack yellow blue)` | Place the Yellow block onto the top of the Blue block. |

The resulting configuration is: The Yellow block is on the Blue block, the Blue block is on the Red block, and the Red block is on the Orange block, satisfying the goal of having Red on Orange and Yellow on Blue.
