This set of instructions translates the PDDL plan into a clear, human-readable sequence of actions designed to achieve the specified Blocksworld goal.

The initial state is: Blue is on Red, Red is on Orange. Yellow is separate on the Table. Both Blue and Yellow are clear.

The goal is: Red remains on Orange, and Yellow is stacked onto Blue.

| Step | Time | Action |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 1 | T=0 | **Pick Up Yellow:** Pick up the Yellow block from the Table. (The agent is now holding Yellow, and the hand is not empty.) |
| 2 | T=1 | **Stack Yellow onto Blue:** Stack the Yellow block onto the Blue block. (The hand becomes empty, and Yellow now rests on Blue.) |

The final configuration achieves the goal state: Yellow is on Blue, and Red remains on Orange (forming a single stack: Yellow on Blue on Red on Orange, all resting on the Table).
