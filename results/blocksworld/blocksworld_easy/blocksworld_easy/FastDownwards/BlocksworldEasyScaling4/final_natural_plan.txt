This is the human-readable plan derived from the PDDL solution to achieve the goal state `(on B Y)` and `(on O R)`.

| Step | Action | Description |
| :---: | :--- | :--- |
| 1 | **Unstack B O** | Unstack the Blue block (B) from the Orange block (O). The agent is now holding B, and O is clear. |
| 2 | **Stack B Y** | Stack the held Blue block (B) onto the Yellow block (Y). The agent's hand is now empty, and the goal state (B on Y, O on R) is achieved. |
