PROBLEM
------------------------------
I am playing with a set of blocks where I need to arrange the blocks into stacks. Here are the actions I can do

Pick up a block
Unstack a block from on top of another block
Put down a block
Stack a block on top of another block

I have the following restrictions on my actions:
I can only pick up or unstack one block at a time.
I can only pick up or unstack a block if my hand is empty.
I can only pick up a block if the block is on the table and the block is clear. A block is clear if the block has no other blocks on top of it and if the block is not picked up.
I can only unstack a block from on top of another block if the block I am unstacking was really on top of the other block.
I can only unstack a block from on top of another block if the block I am unstacking is clear.
Once I pick up or unstack a block, I am holding the block.
I can only put down a block that I am holding.
I can only stack a block on top of another block if I am holding the block being stacked.
I can only stack a block on top of another block if the block onto which I am stacking the block is clear.
Once I put down or stack a block, my hand becomes empty.
Once you stack a block on top of a second block, the second block is no longer clear.

[STATEMENT]
As initial conditions I have that, the orange block is clear, the yellow block is clear, the hand is empty, the blue block is on top of the red block, the orange block is on top of the blue block, the red block is on the table and the yellow block is on the table.
My goal is to have that the blue block is on top of the red block and the yellow block is on top of the orange block.

My plan is as follows:

NATURAL-PLAN sas_plan_1
------------------------------
This sequence of instructions translates the PDDL plan into human-readable steps to solve the 4-disk Tower of Hanoi problem, moving the entire stack from the Middle Peg (M) to the Right Peg (R).

The disks are A (smallest), B, C, D (largest). Pegs are L (Left), M (Middle), and R (Right). Each step represents one unit of time.

| Step | Time | Action Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 1 | 1 | **Move Disk A** from Disk B (on Peg M) to the empty **Peg L**. |
| 2 | 2 | **Move Disk B** from Disk C (on Peg M) to the empty **Peg R**. |
| 3 | 3 | **Move Disk A** from Peg L (where it is the base) onto **Disk B** (on Peg R). |
| 4 | 4 | **Move Disk C** from Disk D (on Peg M) to the empty **Peg L**. |
| 5 | 5 | **Move Disk A** from Disk B (on Peg R) onto **Disk D** (on Peg M). |
| 6 | 6 | **Move Disk B** from Peg R (where it is the base) onto **Disk C** (on Peg L). |
| 7 | 7 | **Move Disk A** from Disk D (on Peg M) onto **Disk B** (on Peg L). |
| 8 | 8 | **Move Disk D** from Peg M (where it is the base) to the empty **Peg R**. |
| 9 | 9 | **Move Disk A** from Disk B (on Peg L) to the empty **Peg M**. |
| 10 | 10 | **Move Disk A** from Peg M (where it is the base) onto **Disk D** (on Peg R). |
| 11 | 11 | **Move Disk B** from Disk C (on Peg L) to the empty **Peg M**. |
| 12 | 12 | **Move Disk A** from Disk D (on Peg R) onto **Disk B** (on Peg M). |
| 13 | 13 | **Move Disk C** from Peg L (where it is the base) onto **Disk D** (on Peg R). |
| 14 | 14 | **Move Disk A** from Disk B (on Peg M) to the empty **Peg L**. |
| 15 | 15 | **Move Disk B** from Peg M (where it is the base) onto **Disk C** (on Peg R). |
| 16 | 16 | **Move Disk A** from Peg L (where it is the base) onto **Disk B** (on Peg R). |

PROBLEM
------------------------------
I am playing with a set of blocks where I need to arrange the blocks into stacks. Here are the actions I can do

Pick up a block
Unstack a block from on top of another block
Put down a block
Stack a block on top of another block

I have the following restrictions on my actions:
I can only pick up or unstack one block at a time.
I can only pick up or unstack a block if my hand is empty.
I can only pick up a block if the block is on the table and the block is clear. A block is clear if the block has no other blocks on top of it and if the block is not picked up.
I can only unstack a block from on top of another block if the block I am unstacking was really on top of the other block.
I can only unstack a block from on top of another block if the block I am unstacking is clear.
Once I pick up or unstack a block, I am holding the block.
I can only put down a block that I am holding.
I can only stack a block on top of another block if I am holding the block being stacked.
I can only stack a block on top of another block if the block onto which I am stacking the block is clear.
Once I put down or stack a block, my hand becomes empty.
Once you stack a block on top of a second block, the second block is no longer clear.

[STATEMENT]
As initial conditions I have that, the blue block is clear, the yellow block is clear, the hand is empty, the red block is on top of the orange block, the yellow block is on top of the red block, the blue block is on the table and the orange block is on the table.
My goal is to have that the red block is on top of the orange block, the blue block is on top of the yellow block and the yellow block is on top of the red block.

My plan is as follows:

This is a sequence of actions required to transfer all four disks (A, B, C, D) from the Right peg to the Left peg, following the rules of the Tower of Hanoi puzzle.

### Tower of Hanoi: 4-Disk Solution Plan

**Initial State:** All disks (A, B, C, D) are stacked on the Right peg (A is on top of B, B is on C, C is on D, D is on Right).

| Step | Time | Action | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | T+1 | (move\_to\_peg a b middle) | Move disk A (smallest) from disk B onto the Middle peg. |
| 2 | T+2 | (move\_to\_peg b c left) | Move disk B from disk C onto the Left peg. |
| 3 | T+3 | (move\_to\_disk a middle b) | Move disk A from the Middle peg onto disk B (on Left). |
| 4 | T+4 | (move\_to\_peg c d middle) | Move disk C from disk D onto the Middle peg. |
| 5 | T+5 | (move\_to\_disk a b d) | Move disk A from disk B onto disk D (on Right). |
| 6 | T+6 | (move\_to\_disk b left c) | Move disk B from the Left peg onto disk C (on Middle). |
| 7 | T+7 | (move\_to\_disk a d b) | Move disk A from disk D onto disk B (on C). |
| 8 | T+8 | (move\_to\_peg d right left) | Move the largest disk D from the Right peg onto the Left peg. |
| 9 | T+9 | (move\_to\_disk a b d) | Move disk A from disk B onto disk D (on Left). |
| 10 | T+10 | (move\_to\_peg b c right) | Move disk B from disk C onto the Right peg. |
| 11 | T+11 | (move\_to\_disk a d b) | Move disk A from disk D onto disk B (on Right). |
| 12 | T+12 | (move\_to\_disk c middle d) | Move disk C from the Middle peg onto disk D (on Left). |
| 13 | T+13 | (move\_to\_peg a b middle) | Move disk A from disk B onto the Middle peg. |
| 14 | T+14 | (move\_to\_disk b right c) | Move disk B from the Right peg onto disk C (on D). |
| 15 | T+15 | (move\_to\_disk a middle b) | Move disk A from the Middle peg onto disk B (on C). |

PROBLEM
------------------------------
I am playing with a set of blocks where I need to arrange the blocks into stacks. Here are the actions I can do

Pick up a block
Unstack a block from on top of another block
Put down a block
Stack a block on top of another block

I have the following restrictions on my actions:
I can only pick up or unstack one block at a time.
I can only pick up or unstack a block if my hand is empty.
I can only pick up a block if the block is on the table and the block is clear. A block is clear if the block has no other blocks on top of it and if the block is not picked up.
I can only unstack a block from on top of another block if the block I am unstacking was really on top of the other block.
I can only unstack a block from on top of another block if the block I am unstacking is clear.
Once I pick up or unstack a block, I am holding the block.
I can only put down a block that I am holding.
I can only stack a block on top of another block if I am holding the block being stacked.
I can only stack a block on top of another block if the block onto which I am stacking the block is clear.
Once I put down or stack a block, my hand becomes empty.
Once you stack a block on top of a second block, the second block is no longer clear.

[STATEMENT]
As initial conditions I have that, the red block is clear, the blue block is clear, the hand is empty, the red block is on top of the orange block, the blue block is on top of the yellow block, the orange block is on the table and the yellow block is on the table.
My goal is to have that the red block is on top of the orange block and the blue block is on top of the red block.

My plan is as follows:

NATURAL-PLAN sas_plan_3
------------------------------
This plan translates the PDDL solution for the Blocksworld instance into a sequence of human-readable instructions.

The objective is to reconfigure the blocks such that Block B is on Block R, and Block R remains on Block O.

| Step | PDDL Action | Human Instruction |
| :--- | :---------- | :---------------- |
| 1    | `(unstack b y)` | Unstack Block B from Block Y. (The agent is now holding B.) |
| 2    | `(stack b r)` | Stack Block B onto Block R. |
================================================================================


PROBLEM
------------------------------
I am playing with a set of blocks where I need to arrange the blocks into stacks. Here are the actions I can do

Pick up a block
Unstack a block from on top of another block
Put down a block
Stack a block on top of another block

I have the following restrictions on my actions:
I can only pick up or unstack one block at a time.
I can only pick up or unstack a block if my hand is empty.
I can only pick up a block if the block is on the table and the block is clear. A block is clear if the block has no other blocks on top of it and if the block is not picked up.
I can only unstack a block from on top of another block if the block I am unstacking was really on top of the other block.
I can only unstack a block from on top of another block if the block I am unstacking is clear.
Once I pick up or unstack a block, I am holding the block.
I can only put down a block that I am holding.
I can only stack a block on top of another block if I am holding the block being stacked.
I can only stack a block on top of another block if the block onto which I am stacking the block is clear.
Once I put down or stack a block, my hand becomes empty.
Once you stack a block on top of a second block, the second block is no longer clear.

[STATEMENT]
As initial conditions I have that, the blue block is clear, the yellow block is clear, the hand is empty, the red block is on top of the orange block, the blue block is on top of the red block, the orange block is on the table and the yellow block is on the table.
My goal is to have that the red block is on top of the orange block and the yellow block is on top of the blue block.

My plan is as follows:

NATURAL-PLAN sas_plan_2
------------------------------
This plan outlines the required sequence of movements to achieve the desired block configuration.

The initial configuration is: The Blue block is stacked on the Red block, which is stacked on the Orange block (Blue/Red/Orange stack). The Yellow block rests on the table separately.

| Step | PDDL Action | Human Instruction |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 1 | `(pick-up yellow)` | Pick up the Yellow block from the table. |
| 2 | `(stack yellow blue)` | Place the Yellow block onto the top of the Blue block. |

The resulting configuration is: The Yellow block is on the Blue block, the Blue block is on the Red block, and the Red block is on the Orange block, satisfying the goal of having Red on Orange and Yellow on Blue.
================================================================================


PROBLEM
------------------------------
I am playing with a set of blocks where I need to arrange the blocks into stacks. Here are the actions I can do

Pick up a block
Unstack a block from on top of another block
Put down a block
Stack a block on top of another block

I have the following restrictions on my actions:
I can only pick up or unstack one block at a time.
I can only pick up or unstack a block if my hand is empty.
I can only pick up a block if the block is on the table and the block is clear. A block is clear if the block has no other blocks on top of it and if the block is not picked up.
I can only unstack a block from on top of another block if the block I am unstacking was really on top of the other block.
I can only unstack a block from on top of another block if the block I am unstacking is clear.
Once I pick up or unstack a block, I am holding the block.
I can only put down a block that I am holding.
I can only stack a block on top of another block if I am holding the block being stacked.
I can only stack a block on top of another block if the block onto which I am stacking the block is clear.
Once I put down or stack a block, my hand becomes empty.
Once you stack a block on top of a second block, the second block is no longer clear.

[STATEMENT]
As initial conditions I have that, the blue block is clear, the yellow block is clear, the hand is empty, the blue block is on top of the orange block, the orange block is on top of the red block, the red block is on the table and the yellow block is on the table.
My goal is to have that the blue block is on top of the yellow block and the orange block is on top of the red block.

My plan is as follows:

NATURAL-PLAN sas_plan_1
------------------------------
This plan details the necessary actions to transition from the initial configuration of the blocks to the desired goal state.

The blocks involved are Blue, Yellow, Orange, and Red.

| Step | Time | Action Description |
| :--- | :--- | :---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1 | T=1 | **Unstack:** Lift the Blue block from the top of the Orange block. (The agent is now holding the Blue block.) |
| 2 | T=2 | **Stack:** Place the held Blue block onto the Yellow block. (The Blue block is now resting on the Yellow block.) |
| **Goal Achieved** | | The configuration is now Blue on Yellow, and Orange on Red (which remains on the table). |
================================================================================


PROBLEM
------------------------------
I am playing with a set of blocks where I need to arrange the blocks into stacks. Here are the actions I can do

Pick up a block
Unstack a block from on top of another block
Put down a block
Stack a block on top of another block

I have the following restrictions on my actions:
I can only pick up or unstack one block at a time.
I can only pick up or unstack a block if my hand is empty.
I can only pick up a block if the block is on the table and the block is clear. A block is clear if the block has no other blocks on top of it and if the block is not picked up.
I can only unstack a block from on top of another block if the block I am unstacking was really on top of the other block.
I can only unstack a block from on top of another block if the block I am unstacking is clear.
Once I pick up or unstack a block, I am holding the block.
I can only put down a block that I am holding.
I can only stack a block on top of another block if I am holding the block being stacked.
I can only stack a block on top of another block if the block onto which I am stacking the block is clear.
Once I put down or stack a block, my hand becomes empty.
Once you stack a block on top of a second block, the second block is no longer clear.

[STATEMENT]
As initial conditions I have that, the blue block is clear, the orange block is clear, the hand is empty, the blue block is on top of the yellow block, the orange block is on top of the red block, the red block is on the table and the yellow block is on the table.
My goal is to have that the blue block is on top of the orange block.

My plan is as follows:

The output must be the `pddl_hanoi_draft`.\n    *   **Domain Focus:** Define types `disk` and `peg`. Establish the static predicate `(smaller ?d1 - disk ?d2 - disk)` initializing the relations (e.g., A < B, B < C, C < D). Ensure the `move` action uses `(clear ?from_peg)` and `(clear ?to_peg)`/`(on ?to_disk ?to_peg)` prerequisites, critically including the constraint that the moved disk must be smaller than the disk it is being placed upon, if any.\n    *   **Problem Focus:** Define the initial state: Disks A, B, C, D are stacked D-C-B-A on the Right peg. Left and Middle pegs are clear.\n    *   **Goal Focus:** Define the goal state: Disks D, C, B, A are stacked sequentially on the Left peg.\n\n2. **Phase 2: PDDL Verification and Correction (Auditor)**\n    The Auditor agent must ingest the `pddl_hanoi_draft`. The primary task is auditing the move logic.\n    *   **Audit Checkpoint:** Confirm that the `move` action preconditions strictly enforce the rule: when moving disk `?d` to peg `?p` (which might contain disk `?p_top`), the condition `(smaller ?d ?p_top)` or the alternative handling for moving to a clear peg must be correctly implemented to prevent placing a larger disk on a smaller one.\n    *   **Output:** Produce the verified and corrected PDDL as `pddl_hanoi_verified`.\n\n3. **Phase 3: Final Solution Integration (Orchestrator)**\n    The Orchestrator agent must receive and confirm the verified `pddl_hanoi_verified`. This agent's task is purely structural: integrating the confirmed domain and problem files into the final solution format (`pddl_final_solution`) for external solving.",

The output must be the `pddl_hanoi_draft`.\n    *   **Domain Focus:** Define types `disk` and `peg`. Establish the static predicate `(smaller ?d1 - disk ?d2 - disk)` initializing the relations (e.g., A < B, B < C, C < D). Ensure the `move` action uses `(clear ?from_peg)` and `(clear ?to_peg)`/`(on ?to_disk ?to_peg)` prerequisites, critically including the constraint that the moved disk must be smaller than the disk it is being placed upon, if any.\n    *   **Problem Focus:** Define the initial state: Disks A, B, C, D are stacked D-C-B-A on the Right peg. Left and Middle pegs are clear.\n    *   **Goal Focus:** Define the goal state: Disks D, C, B, A are stacked sequentially on the Left peg.\n\n2. **Phase 2: PDDL Verification and Correction (Auditor)**\n    The Auditor agent must ingest the `pddl_hanoi_draft`. The primary task is auditing the move logic.\n    *   **Audit Checkpoint:** Confirm that the `move` action preconditions strictly enforce the rule: when moving disk `?d` to peg `?p` (which might contain disk `?p_top`), the condition `(smaller ?d ?p_top)` or the alternative handling for moving to a clear peg must be correctly implemented to prevent placing a larger disk on a smaller one.\n    *   **Output:** Produce the verified and corrected PDDL as `pddl_hanoi_verified`.\n\n3. **Phase 3: Final Solution Integration (Orchestrator)**\n    The Orchestrator agent must receive and confirm the verified `pddl_hanoi_verified`. This agent's task is purely structural: integrating the confirmed domain and problem files into the final solution format (`pddl_final_solution`) for external solving.",

The output must be the `pddl_hanoi_draft`.\n    *   **Domain Focus:** Define types `disk` and `peg`. Establish the static predicate `(smaller ?d1 - disk ?d2 - disk)` initializing the relations (e.g., A < B, B < C, C < D). Ensure the `move` action uses `(clear ?from_peg)` and `(clear ?to_peg)`/`(on ?to_disk ?to_peg)` prerequisites, critically including the constraint that the moved disk must be smaller than the disk it is being placed upon, if any.\n    *   **Problem Focus:** Define the initial state: Disks A, B, C, D are stacked D-C-B-A on the Right peg. Left and Middle pegs are clear.\n    *   **Goal Focus:** Define the goal state: Disks D, C, B, A are stacked sequentially on the Left peg.\n\n2. **Phase 2: PDDL Verification and Correction (Auditor)**\n    The Auditor agent must ingest the `pddl_hanoi_draft`. The primary task is auditing the move logic.\n    *   **Audit Checkpoint:** Confirm that the `move` action preconditions strictly enforce the rule: when moving disk `?d` to peg `?p` (which might contain disk `?p_top`), the condition `(smaller ?d ?p_top)` or the alternative handling for moving to a clear peg must be correctly implemented to prevent placing a larger disk on a smaller one.\n    *   **Output:** Produce the verified and corrected PDDL as `pddl_hanoi_verified`.\n\n3. **Phase 3: Final Solution Integration (Orchestrator)**\n    The Orchestrator agent must receive and confirm the verified `pddl_hanoi_verified`. This agent's task is purely structural: integrating the confirmed domain and problem files into the final solution format (`pddl_final_solution`) for external solving.",

PROBLEM
------------------------------
I am playing with a set of blocks where I need to arrange the blocks into stacks. Here are the actions I can do

Pick up a block
Unstack a block from on top of another block
Put down a block
Stack a block on top of another block

I have the following restrictions on my actions:
I can only pick up or unstack one block at a time.
I can only pick up or unstack a block if my hand is empty.
I can only pick up a block if the block is on the table and the block is clear. A block is clear if the block has no other blocks on top of it and if the block is not picked up.
I can only unstack a block from on top of another block if the block I am unstacking was really on top of the other block.
I can only unstack a block from on top of another block if the block I am unstacking is clear.
Once I pick up or unstack a block, I am holding the block.
I can only put down a block that I am holding.
I can only stack a block on top of another block if I am holding the block being stacked.
I can only stack a block on top of another block if the block onto which I am stacking the block is clear.
Once I put down or stack a block, my hand becomes empty.
Once you stack a block on top of a second block, the second block is no longer clear.

[STATEMENT]
As initial conditions I have that, the orange block is clear, the yellow block is clear, the hand is empty, the blue block is on top of the red block, the orange block is on top of the blue block, the red block is on the table and the yellow block is on the table.
My goal is to have that the orange block is on top of the yellow block.

My plan is as follows:

NATURAL-PLAN sas_plan_4
------------------------------
This is the sequence of actions required to achieve the goal state, based on the provided PDDL plan:

| Step | PDDL Action | Human Instruction |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 1 | `(unstack orange blue)` | Unstack the **Orange** block from the **Blue** block. (The hand is now holding Orange.) |
| 2 | `(stack orange yellow)` | Stack the **Orange** block (currently held) onto the **Yellow** block. (The hand is now empty.) |

The resulting state is: Orange on Yellow, Blue on Red, Red and Yellow on the table, achieving the goal `(on orange yellow)`.

PROBLEM
------------------------------
I am playing with a set of blocks where I need to arrange the blocks into stacks. Here are the actions I can do

Pick up a block
Unstack a block from on top of another block
Put down a block
Stack a block on top of another block

I have the following restrictions on my actions:
I can only pick up or unstack one block at a time.
I can only pick up or unstack a block if my hand is empty.
I can only pick up a block if the block is on the table and the block is clear. A block is clear if the block has no other blocks on top of it and if the block is not picked up.
I can only unstack a block from on top of another block if the block I am unstacking was really on top of the other block.
I can only unstack a block from on top of another block if the block I am unstacking is clear.
Once I pick up or unstack a block, I am holding the block.
I can only put down a block that I am holding.
I can only stack a block on top of another block if I am holding the block being stacked.
I can only stack a block on top of another block if the block onto which I am stacking the block is clear.
Once I put down or stack a block, my hand becomes empty.
Once you stack a block on top of a second block, the second block is no longer clear.

[STATEMENT]
As initial conditions I have that, the red block is clear, the orange block is clear, the yellow block is clear, the hand is empty, the orange block is on top of the blue block, the red block is on the table, the blue block is on the table and the yellow block is on the table.
My goal is to have that the orange block is on top of the blue block and the yellow block is on top of the red block.

My plan is as follows:

NATURAL-PLAN sas_plan_2
------------------------------
This plan outlines the 15 required moves to transfer four disks (A, B, C, D, smallest to largest) from the Middle Peg (P2) to the Right Peg (P3), following the constraints of the Tower of Hanoi puzzle.

### Tower of Hanoi 4-Disk Solution (P2 $\rightarrow$ P3)

| Step | Action Type | Source Location | Disk Moved | Destination Location |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 1 | Move Disk | On Disk B | Disk A (Smallest) | Peg P1 (Left) |
| 2 | Move Disk | On Disk C | Disk B | Peg P3 (Right) |
| 3 | Move Disk | Peg P1 (Left) | Disk A (Smallest) | On Disk B |
| 4 | Move Disk | On Disk D | Disk C | Peg P1 (Left) |
| 5 | Move Disk | On Disk B | Disk A (Smallest) | On Disk D |
| 6 | Move Disk | Peg P3 (Right) | Disk B | On Disk C |
| 7 | Move Disk | On Disk D | Disk A (Smallest) | On Disk B |
| 8 | Move Disk | Peg P2 (Middle) | Disk D (Largest) | Peg P3 (Right) |
| 9 | Move Disk | On Disk B | Disk A (Smallest) | On Disk D |
| 10 | Move Disk | On Disk C | Disk B | Peg P2 (Middle) |
| 11 | Move Disk | On Disk D | Disk A (Smallest) | On Disk B |
| 12 | Move Disk | Peg P1 (Left) | Disk C | On Disk D |
| 13 | Move Disk | On Disk B | Disk A (Smallest) | Peg P1 (Left) |
| 14 | Move Disk | Peg P2 (Middle) | Disk B | On Disk C |
| 15 | Move Disk | Peg P1 (Left) | Disk A (Smallest) | On Disk B |

**Total Cost:** 15 moves.
**Final State:** All disks (D, C, B, A, bottom to top) are successfully stacked on the Right Peg (P3).
