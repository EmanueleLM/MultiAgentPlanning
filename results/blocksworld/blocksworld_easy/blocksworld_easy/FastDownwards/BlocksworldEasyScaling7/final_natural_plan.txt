This plan outlines the 15 required moves to transfer four disks (A, B, C, D, smallest to largest) from the Middle Peg (P2) to the Right Peg (P3), following the constraints of the Tower of Hanoi puzzle.

### Tower of Hanoi 4-Disk Solution (P2 $\rightarrow$ P3)

| Step | Action Type | Source Location | Disk Moved | Destination Location |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 1 | Move Disk | On Disk B | Disk A (Smallest) | Peg P1 (Left) |
| 2 | Move Disk | On Disk C | Disk B | Peg P3 (Right) |
| 3 | Move Disk | Peg P1 (Left) | Disk A (Smallest) | On Disk B |
| 4 | Move Disk | On Disk D | Disk C | Peg P1 (Left) |
| 5 | Move Disk | On Disk B | Disk A (Smallest) | On Disk D |
| 6 | Move Disk | Peg P3 (Right) | Disk B | On Disk C |
| 7 | Move Disk | On Disk D | Disk A (Smallest) | On Disk B |
| 8 | Move Disk | Peg P2 (Middle) | Disk D (Largest) | Peg P3 (Right) |
| 9 | Move Disk | On Disk B | Disk A (Smallest) | On Disk D |
| 10 | Move Disk | On Disk C | Disk B | Peg P2 (Middle) |
| 11 | Move Disk | On Disk D | Disk A (Smallest) | On Disk B |
| 12 | Move Disk | Peg P1 (Left) | Disk C | On Disk D |
| 13 | Move Disk | On Disk B | Disk A (Smallest) | Peg P1 (Left) |
| 14 | Move Disk | Peg P2 (Middle) | Disk B | On Disk C |
| 15 | Move Disk | Peg P1 (Left) | Disk A (Smallest) | On Disk B |

**Total Cost:** 15 moves.
**Final State:** All disks (D, C, B, A, bottom to top) are successfully stacked on the Right Peg (P3).
