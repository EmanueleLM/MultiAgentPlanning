This is the set of human-readable instructions derived from the PDDL plan to solve the 4-disk Tower of Hanoi puzzle, moving all disks from Peg 2 (Middle) to Peg 3 (Right).

The disks are ordered by size: A (smallest), B, C, D (largest).

| Step | Action | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 1 | **(Move A)** | Move the smallest disk (Disk A) from Disk B (on Peg 2) to Peg 1 (Left). |
| 2 | **(Move B)** | Move Disk B from Disk C (on Peg 2) to Peg 3 (Right). |
| 3 | **(Move A)** | Move Disk A from Peg 1 onto Disk B (on Peg 3). |
| 4 | **(Move C)** | Move Disk C from Disk D (on Peg 2) to Peg 1 (Left). |
| 5 | **(Move A)** | Move Disk A from Disk B (on Peg 3) onto Disk D (on Peg 2). |
| 6 | **(Move B)** | Move Disk B from Peg 3 onto Disk C (on Peg 1). |
| 7 | **(Move A)** | Move Disk A from Disk D (on Peg 2) onto Disk B (on Peg 1). |
| 8 | **(Move D)** | Move the largest disk (Disk D) from Peg 2 to Peg 3 (Right). |
| 9 | **(Move A)** | Move Disk A from Disk B (on Peg 1) onto Disk D (on Peg 3). |
| 10 | **(Move B)** | Move Disk B from Disk C (on Peg 1) to Peg 2 (Middle). |
| 11 | **(Move A)** | Move Disk A from Disk D (on Peg 3) onto Disk B (on Peg 2). |
| 12 | **(Move C)** | Move Disk C from Peg 1 onto Disk D (on Peg 3). |
| 13 | **(Move A)** | Move Disk A from Disk B (on Peg 2) to Peg 1 (Left). |
| 14 | **(Move B)** | Move Disk B from Peg 2 onto Disk C (on Peg 3). |
| 15 | **(Move A)** | Move Disk A from Peg 1 onto Disk B (on Peg 3). |

**Goal State Reached:** All four disks (D, C, B, A) are stacked sequentially on Peg 3. (Total 15 moves)
