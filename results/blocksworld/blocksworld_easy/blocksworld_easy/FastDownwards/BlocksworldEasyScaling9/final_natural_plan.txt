This plan provides the instructions necessary to move all four disks (A, B, C, D) from the Middle Peg to the Right Peg, following the rules of the Tower of Hanoi puzzle (smaller disks must always be placed on top of larger disks or on an empty peg).

The disks are sized D (largest) > C > B > A (smallest). The pegs are Left (L), Middle (M), and Right (R).

### Human-Readable Action Sequence

1.  **Move Disk A** from Disk B (on Middle Peg) to the **Left Peg (L)**.
2.  **Move Disk B** from Disk C (on Middle Peg) to the **Right Peg (R)**.
3.  **Move Disk A** from the Left Peg (L) onto **Disk B** (on R).
4.  **Move Disk C** from Disk D (on Middle Peg) to the **Left Peg (L)**.
5.  **Move Disk A** from Disk B (on R) onto **Disk D** (on M).
6.  **Move Disk B** from the Right Peg (R) onto **Disk C** (on L).
7.  **Move Disk A** from Disk D (on M) onto **Disk B** (on L).
8.  **Move Disk D** from the Middle Peg (M) to the **Right Peg (R)**.
9.  **Move Disk A** from Disk B (on L) to the **Middle Peg (M)**.
10. **Move Disk A** from the Middle Peg (M) onto **Disk D** (on R).
11. **Move Disk B** from Disk C (on L) to the **Middle Peg (M)**.
12. **Move Disk A** from Disk D (on R) onto **Disk B** (on M).
13. **Move Disk C** from the Left Peg (L) onto **Disk D** (on R).
14. **Move Disk A** from Disk B (on M) to the **Left Peg (L)**.
15. **Move Disk B** from the Middle Peg (M) onto **Disk C** (on R).
16. **Move Disk A** from the Left Peg (L) onto **Disk B** (on R).

***

**Goal State Achieved:** All four disks (D, C, B, A) are stacked correctly on the Right Peg.
