This is the sequence of actions required by the `robot_arm` to achieve the goal configuration (Red on Orange, Yellow on Red) starting from the initial state (Blue on Orange, Orange on Yellow, Yellow on Red, Red on Table).

The **Orchestrator** instructs the **Robot Arm** to execute the following steps:

1.  **Unstack:** Unstack the Blue block (B) from the Orange block (O).
2.  **Put-Down:** Place the Blue block (B) onto the table.
3.  **Unstack:** Unstack the Orange block (O) from the Yellow block (Y).
4.  **Put-Down:** Place the Orange block (O) onto the table.
5.  **Unstack:** Unstack the Yellow block (Y) from the Red block (R).
6.  **Put-Down:** Place the Yellow block (Y) onto the table.
    *(All blocks are now on the table: B, O, Y, R)*
7.  **Pick-Up:** Pick up the Red block (R) from the table.
8.  **Stack:** Stack the Red block (R) onto the Orange block (O). (Goal achieved: R on O)
9.  **Pick-Up:** Pick up the Yellow block (Y) from the table.
10. **Stack:** Stack the Yellow block (Y) onto the Red block (R). (Goal achieved: Y on R)

Goal State Achieved: The Yellow block is on Red, and the Red block is on Orange. The hand is empty.
