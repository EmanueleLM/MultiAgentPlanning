This sequence of actions translates the PDDL plan into human-readable instructions to transform the initial block configuration (T -> Y -> B -> O -> R) into the goal configuration (T -> Y -> R -> B and T -> O).

The blocks are identified as: R (Red), O (Orange), B (Blue), Y (Yellow), and T (Table).

| Step | PDDL Action | Human Instruction |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 1 | `(unstack r o)` | **Unstack** the Red block (R) from the top of the Orange block (O). |
| 2 | `(put-down r t)` | **Put down** the Red block (R) onto the Table (T). |
| 3 | `(unstack o b)` | **Unstack** the Orange block (O) from the top of the Blue block (B). |
| 4 | `(put-down o t)` | **Put down** the Orange block (O) onto the Table (T). |
| 5 | `(unstack b y)` | **Unstack** the Blue block (B) from the top of the Yellow block (Y). |
| 6 | `(put-down b t)` | **Put down** the Blue block (B) onto the Table (T). |
| 7 | `(pick-up r t)` | **Pick up** the Red block (R) from the Table (T). |
| 8 | `(stack r y)` | **Stack** the Red block (R) onto the Yellow block (Y). |
| 9 | `(pick-up b t)` | **Pick up** the Blue block (B) from the Table (T). |
| 10 | `(stack b r)` | **Stack** the Blue block (B) onto the Red block (R). |

***
**Final State Verification:**
*   Red (R) is on Yellow (Y).
*   Blue (B) is on Red (R).
*   Yellow (Y) is on the Table (T).
*   Orange (O) is on the Table (T).
*   The hand is empty.
*   Blue (B) is clear. (Goal achieved)
