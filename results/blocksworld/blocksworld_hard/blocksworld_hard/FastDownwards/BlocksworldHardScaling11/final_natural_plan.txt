This sequence details the steps required to move the six disks (A, B, C, D, E, F) from the MIDDLE peg to the RIGHT peg, following the rules of the Tower of Hanoi (a smaller disk may never be placed on a larger disk).

The disks are denoted by A (smallest) through F (largest). Pegs are LEFT, MIDDLE, and RIGHT.
