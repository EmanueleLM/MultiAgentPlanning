This sequence of instructions outlines the optimal path to solve the 6-disk Tower of Hanoi puzzle, moving all disks from the Right Peg (R) to the Middle Peg (M), using the Left Peg (L) as auxiliary. Disk A is the smallest, and Disk F is the largest.

**Initial State:** Stack F-E-D-C-B-A on Peg R. Pegs L and M are empty.
**Goal State:** Stack F-E-D-C-B-A on Peg M.
