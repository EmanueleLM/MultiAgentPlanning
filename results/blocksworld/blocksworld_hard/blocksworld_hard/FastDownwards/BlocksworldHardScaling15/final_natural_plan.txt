Based on the provided PDDL artifacts, the task is to rearrange four blocks (R=Red, B=Blue, O=Orange, Y=Yellow) from an initial configuration (Blue on Orange, Orange on Yellow; Red on table) to a final stack (Blue on Red, Red on Yellow, Yellow on Orange).

The following sequence of 12 human-readable actions translates the provided PDDL plan:

| Step | Action | Instruction |
| :--- | :----- | :---------- |
| 1    | `(unstack b o)` | Unstack the **Blue block (B)** from the **Orange block (O)**. |
| 2    | `(stack b r)` | Stack the **Blue block (B)** onto the **Red block (R)**. |
| 3    | `(unstack o y)` | Unstack the **Orange block (O)** from the **Yellow block (Y)**. |
| 4    | `(put-down o)` | Put down the **Orange block (O)** onto the table. |
| 5    | `(pick-up y)` | Pick up the **Yellow block (Y)** from the table. |
| 6    | `(stack y o)` | Stack the **Yellow block (Y)** onto the **Orange block (O)**. |
| 7    | `(unstack b r)` | Unstack the **Blue block (B)** from the **Red block (R)**. |
| 8    | `(put-down b)` | Put down the **Blue block (B)** onto the table. |
| 9    | `(pick-up r)` | Pick up the **Red block (R)** from the table. |
| 10   | `(stack r y)` | Stack the **Red block (R)** onto the **Yellow block (Y)**. |
| 11   | `(pick-up b)` | Pick up the **Blue block (B)** from the table. |
| 12   | `(stack b r)` | Stack the **Blue block (B)** onto the **Red block (R)**. |

The blocks are now in the goal configuration: Blue on Red, Red on Yellow, Yellow on Orange (with Orange on the table).
