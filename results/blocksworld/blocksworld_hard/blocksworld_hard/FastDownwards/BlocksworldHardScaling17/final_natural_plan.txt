This sequence of actions translates the PDDL plan into natural language instructions to achieve the goal configuration (Red on Blue, Blue on Yellow, Yellow on Orange).

The initial state is: Red is on Orange, Orange is on Blue, Blue is on the Table. Yellow is on the Table.

| Step | Time | Instruction |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 1 | 00:01 | **Unstack** the Red block from the Orange block. |
| 2 | 00:02 | **Put down** the Red block onto the table. |
| 3 | 00:03 | **Unstack** the Orange block from the Blue block. |
| 4 | 00:04 | **Put down** the Orange block onto the table. |
| 5 | 00:05 | **Pick up** the Red block from the table. |
| 6 | 00:06 | **Stack** the held Red block onto the Blue block. |
| 7 | 00:07 | **Pick up** the Yellow block from the table. |
| 8 | 00:08 | **Stack** the held Yellow block onto the Orange block. |
| 9 | 00:09 | **Unstack** the Red block from the Blue block. |
| 10 | 00:10 | **Put down** the Red block onto the table. |
| 11 | 00:11 | **Pick up** the Blue block from the table. |
| 12 | 00:12 | **Stack** the held Blue block onto the Yellow block. |
| 13 | 00:13 | **Pick up** the Red block from the table. |
| 14 | 00:14 | **Stack** the held Red block onto the Blue block. |

The final stack configuration (R on B, B on Y, Y on O, O on table) is achieved.
