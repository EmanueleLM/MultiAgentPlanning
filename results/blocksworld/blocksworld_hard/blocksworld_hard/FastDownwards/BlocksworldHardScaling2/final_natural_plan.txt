This task requires rearranging four blocks (Yellow, Red, Orange, Blue) from the initial configuration (Yellow on Red, Red on Orange, Orange on Blue, Blue on the table) to the target configuration (Red on Blue, and Yellow on Orange).

Here is the sequence of human-readable actions required to achieve the goal:

| Step | Action | Description |

| 1 | `(unstack yellow red)` | Unstack the Yellow block from the Red block. (Hand is now holding Yellow.) |
| 2 | `(put-down yellow)` | Place the Yellow block down onto the table. (Hand is now empty.) |
| 3 | `(unstack red orange)` | Unstack the Red block from the Orange block. (Hand is now holding Red.) |
| 4 | `(put-down red)` | Place the Red block down onto the table. (Hand is now empty.) |
| 5 | `(unstack orange blue)` | Unstack the Orange block from the Blue block. (Hand is now holding Orange.) |
| 6 | `(put-down orange)` | Place the Orange block down onto the table. (Hand is now empty. All blocks are now on the table.) |
| 7 | `(pick-up red)` | Pick up the Red block from the table. (Hand is now holding Red.) |
| 8 | `(stack red blue)` | Stack the Red block onto the Blue block. (Hand is now empty.) |
