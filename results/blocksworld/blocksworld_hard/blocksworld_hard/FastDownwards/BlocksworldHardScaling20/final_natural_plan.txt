This is the sequence of human-readable instructions derived from the provided PDDL plan, starting from the initial state: (B on R), (R on Y), (Y on O), (O on Table).

**Goal:** Achieve the state where the Red block (R) is on the Yellow block (Y), AND the Orange block (O) is on the Blue block (B).

1. **Unstack B (Blue) from R (Red):** Lift the Blue block off the Red block. (The agent is now holding B.)
2. **Put-Down B (Blue):** Place the Blue block onto the table.
3. **Unstack R (Red) from Y (Yellow):** Lift the Red block off the Yellow block. (The agent is now holding R.)
4. **Put-Down R (Red):** Place the Red block onto the table.
5. **Unstack Y (Yellow) from O (Orange):** Lift the Yellow block off the Orange block. (The agent is now holding Y.)
6. **Put-Down Y (Yellow):** Place the Yellow block onto the table.
    *(Current state: All blocks B, R, Y, O are resting individually on the table.)*
7. **Pick-Up O (Orange):** Lift the Orange block from the table. (The agent is now holding O.)
8. **Stack O (Orange) onto B (Blue):** Place the Orange block onto the Blue block. *(Goal: (on O B) achieved.)*
9. **Pick-Up R (Red):** Lift the Red block from the table. (The agent is now holding R.)
10. **Stack R (Red) onto Y (Yellow):** Place the Red block onto the Yellow block. *(Goal: (on R Y) achieved.)*
