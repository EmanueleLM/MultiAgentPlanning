This is the sequence of actions required to transform the initial R/B/O/Y stack into the target B/O/Y/R configuration. Each step is assumed to take 1 unit of time.

| Step | Time | Action | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 1 | t=1 | **Unstack (R, B)** | Unstack the Red block (R) from the Blue block (B). |
| 2 | t=2 | **Put-Down (R)** | Place the Red block (R) onto the table. |
| 3 | t=3 | **Unstack (B, O)** | Unstack the Blue block (B) from the Orange block (O). |
| 4 | t=4 | **Put-Down (B)** | Place the Blue block (B) onto the table. |
| 5 | t=5 | **Unstack (O, Y)** | Unstack the Orange block (O) from the Yellow block (Y). |
| 6 | t=6 | **Put-Down (O)** | Place the Orange block (O) onto the table. |
| 7 | t=7 | **Pick-Up (Y)** | Pick up the Yellow block (Y) from the table. |
| 8 | t=8 | **Stack (Y, R)** | Stack the Yellow block (Y) onto the Red block (R). (R is now on the table) |
| 9 | t=9 | **Pick-Up (O)** | Pick up the Orange block (O) from the table. |
| 10 | t=10 | **Stack (O, Y)** | Stack the Orange block (O) onto the Yellow block (Y). |
| 11 | t=11 | **Pick-Up (B)** | Pick up the Blue block (B) from the table. |
| 12 | t=12 | **Stack (B, O)** | Stack the Blue block (B) onto the Orange block (O). |

The final state (Blue on Orange, Orange on Yellow, Yellow on Red, Red on table) is achieved. (Total Duration: 12 units)
