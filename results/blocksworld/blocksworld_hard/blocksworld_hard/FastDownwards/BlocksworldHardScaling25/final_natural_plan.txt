This plan describes the sequence of 18 actions required to transition from the initial configuration (O on Y, Y on B, B on R) to the goal configuration (B on Y, Y on O, O on R).

### Action Sequence

1.  **Unstack Orange (O) from Yellow (Y).** (O is now held.)
2.  **Put down Orange (O)** onto the table. (Hand is empty.)
3.  **Unstack Yellow (Y) from Blue (B).** (Y is now held, B is clear.)
4.  **Stack Yellow (Y) onto Orange (O).** (Y is on O.)
5.  **Unstack Blue (B) from Red (R).** (B is now held, R is clear.)
6.  **Put down Blue (B)** onto the table. (Hand is empty.)
7.  **Unstack Yellow (Y) from Orange (O).** (Y is now held, O is clear.)
8.  **Put down Yellow (Y)** onto the table. (Hand is empty.)
9.  **Pick up Blue (B)** from the table. (B is now held.)
10. **Stack Blue (B) onto Yellow (Y).** (B is on Y.)
11. **Pick up Orange (O)** from the table. (O is now held.)
12. **Stack Orange (O) onto Red (R).** (O is on R.)
13. **Unstack Blue (B) from Yellow (Y).** (B is now held, Y is clear.)
14. **Put down Blue (B)** onto the table. (Hand is empty.)
15. **Pick up Yellow (Y)** from the table. (Y is now held.)
16. **Stack Yellow (Y) onto Orange (O).** (Y is on O.)
17. **Pick up Blue (B)** from the table. (B is now held.)
18. **Stack Blue (B) onto Yellow (Y).** (B is on Y.)

The goal state is achieved: Blue (B) is on Yellow (Y), Yellow (Y) is on Orange (O), and Orange (O) is on Red (R).
