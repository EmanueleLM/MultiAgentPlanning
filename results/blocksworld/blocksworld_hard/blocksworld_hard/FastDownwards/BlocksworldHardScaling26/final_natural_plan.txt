This plan details the steps required to transform the initial block arrangement (Red on Blue, Blue on Yellow, Yellow on Orange, Orange on Table) into the goal arrangement (Yellow on Orange, Orange on Red, Red on Blue, Blue on Table) using standard Blocksworld operations.

| Step | Time | Action | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 1 | t=1 | UNSTACK | Unstack the Red (R) block from the Blue (B) block. (Hand now holds R; B is Clear) |
| 2 | t=2 | PUT-DOWN | Put down the Red (R) block onto the table. (Hand is now Empty; R is on Table) |
| 3 | t=3 | UNSTACK | Unstack the Blue (B) block from the Yellow (Y) block. (Hand now holds B; Y is Clear) |
| 4 | t=4 | PUT-DOWN | Put down the Blue (B) block onto the table. (Hand is now Empty; B is on Table) |
| 5 | t=5 | PICK-UP | Pick up the Red (R) block from the table. (Hand now holds R) |
| 6 | t=6 | STACK | Stack the Red (R) block onto the Blue (B) block. (Hand is now Empty; R is on B) |
| 7 | t=7 | UNSTACK | Unstack the Yellow (Y) block from the Orange (O) block. (Hand now holds Y; O is Clear) |
| 8 | t=8 | PUT-DOWN | Put down the Yellow (Y) block onto the table. (Hand is now Empty; Y is on Table) |
| 9 | t=9 | PICK-UP | Pick up the Orange (O) block from the table. (Hand now holds O) |
| 10 | t=10 | STACK | Stack the Orange (O) block onto the Red (R) block. (Hand is now Empty; O is on R) |
| 11 | t=11 | PICK-UP | Pick up the Yellow (Y) block from the table. (Hand now holds Y) |
| 12 | t=12 | STACK | Stack the Yellow (Y) block onto the Orange (O) block. (Hand is now Empty; Y is on O) |

**Final Configuration:** The blocks are stacked as Yellow on Orange, Orange on Red, and Red on Blue, with Blue resting on the table, achieving the goal state.
