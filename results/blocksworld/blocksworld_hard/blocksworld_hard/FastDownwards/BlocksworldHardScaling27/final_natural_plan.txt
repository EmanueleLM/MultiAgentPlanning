This planning sequence outlines the steps required to reconfigure the blocks from the initial stack (Blue/Red/Orange/Yellow) to the target configuration (Blue/Yellow/Red/Orange on the table).

| Step | Action Type | Details |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 1 | **Unstack** | Unstack the **Blue** block from the **Red** block. (Hand is now holding Blue.) |
| 2 | **Put Down** | Put the held **Blue** block down onto the table. |
| 3 | **Unstack** | Unstack the **Red** block from the **Orange** block. (Hand is now holding Red.) |
| 4 | **Put Down** | Put the held **Red** block down onto the table. |
| 5 | **Unstack** | Unstack the **Orange** block from the **Yellow** block. (Hand is now holding Orange.) |
| 6 | **Put Down** | Put the held **Orange** block down onto the table. (All blocks are now on the table.) |
| 7 | **Pick Up** | Pick up the **Blue** block from the table. (Hand is now holding Blue.) |
| 8 | **Stack** | Stack the held **Blue** block onto the **Yellow** block. |
| 9 | **Pick Up** | Pick up the **Red** block from the table. (Hand is now holding Red.) |
| 10 | **Stack** | Stack the held **Red** block onto the **Orange** block. |
| 11 | **Unstack** | Unstack the **Blue** block from the **Yellow** block. (Hand is now holding Blue.) |
| 12 | **Put Down** | Put the held **Blue** block down onto the table. |
| 13 | **Pick Up** | Pick up the **Yellow** block from the table. (Hand is now holding Yellow.) |
| 14 | **Stack** | Stack the held **Yellow** block onto the **Red** block. (This completes the Y/R/O foundation stack.) |
| 15 | **Pick Up** | Pick up the **Blue** block from the table. (Hand is now holding Blue.) |
| 16 | **Stack** | Stack the held **Blue** block onto the **Yellow** block. (Goal achieved: B/Y/R/O stack, satisfying On(R, O), On(Y, R), On(B, Y).) |
