This is the sequence of natural language instructions derived from the PDDL plan to achieve the target block configuration.

The initial state is: A stack of Red on Blue on Yellow (with Yellow resting on the table), and Orange resting separately on the table.

The goal is to achieve the structure: Blue on Yellow on Orange on Red (with Red resting on the table).

| Step | Action | Description |
|---|---|---|
| 1. | UNSTACK RED BLUE | Unstack the **red** block from the **blue** block. (The agent is now holding red.) |
| 2. | PUT-DOWN RED | Place the **red** block down onto the table. (The hand is now empty.) |
| 3. | PICK-UP ORANGE | Pick up the **orange** block from the table. (The agent is now holding orange.) |
| 4. | STACK ORANGE RED | Stack the **orange** block onto the **red** block. (Orange is now on Red; the hand is empty.) |
| 5. | UNSTACK BLUE YELLOW | Unstack the **blue** block from the **yellow** block. (The agent is now holding blue.) |
| 6. | PUT-DOWN BLUE | Place the **blue** block down onto the table. (The hand is now empty.) |
| 7. | PICK-UP YELLOW | Pick up the **yellow** block from the table. (The agent is now holding yellow.) |
| 8. | STACK YELLOW ORANGE | Stack the **yellow** block onto the **orange** block. (Yellow is now on Orange; the hand is empty.) |
| 9. | PICK-UP BLUE | Pick up the **blue** block from the table. (The agent is now holding blue.) |
| 10. | STACK BLUE YELLOW | Stack the **blue** block onto the **yellow** block. (Blue is now on Yellow; the hand is empty.) |

The final arrangement is Blue on Yellow on Orange on Red, satisfying the goal state.
