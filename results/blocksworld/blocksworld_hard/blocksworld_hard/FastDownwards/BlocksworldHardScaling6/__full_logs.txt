PROBLEM
------------------------------
I am playing with a set of blocks where I need to arrange the blocks into stacks. Here are the actions I can do

Pick up a block
Unstack a block from on top of another block
Put down a block
Stack a block on top of another block

I have the following restrictions on my actions:
I can only pick up or unstack one block at a time.
I can only pick up or unstack a block if my hand is empty.
I can only pick up a block if the block is on the table and the block is clear. A block is clear if the block has no other blocks on top of it and if the block is not picked up.
I can only unstack a block from on top of another block if the block I am unstacking was really on top of the other block.
I can only unstack a block from on top of another block if the block I am unstacking is clear.
Once I pick up or unstack a block, I am holding the block.
I can only put down a block that I am holding.
I can only stack a block on top of another block if I am holding the block being stacked.
I can only stack a block on top of another block if the block onto which I am stacking the block is clear.
Once I put down or stack a block, my hand becomes empty.
Once you stack a block on top of a second block, the second block is no longer clear.

[STATEMENT]
As initial conditions I have that, the blue block is clear, the hand is empty, the blue block is on top of the orange block, the orange block is on top of the yellow block, the yellow block is on top of the red block and the red block is on the table.
My goal is to have that the red block is on top of the orange block and the yellow block is on top of the red block.

My plan is as follows:

FINAL-PLAN
------------------------------
This final PDDL specification combines the proposed Blocks World domain and problem, validated by the auditor, and is optimized for standard STRIPS planning environments like FastDownwards.

### PDDL Domain

The domain implements the four standard Blocks World actions (`pick-up`, `put-down`, `unstack`, `stack`) using standard STRIPS requirements and typing.

```pddl
<domain>
(define (domain blocks-world)
    (:requirements :strips :typing)
    
    (:types
        block - object
    )
    
    (:predicates
        (on ?x - block ?y - block)  ; X is resting directly on Y
        (ontable ?x - block)        ; X is resting directly on the table
        (clear ?x - block)          ; Nothing is resting on X
        (holding ?x - block)        ; The hand is holding X
        (handempty)                 ; The hand is not holding any block
    )

    ;; 1. Pick up a block X from the table
    (:action pick-up
        :parameters (?x - block)
        :precondition (and 
            (ontable ?x)
            (clear ?x) 
            (handempty)
        )
        :effect (and 
            (not (ontable ?x))
            (not (clear ?x))
            (not (handempty))
            (holding ?x)
        )
    )

    ;; 2. Put down a held block X onto the table
    (:action put-down
        :parameters (?x - block)
        :precondition (holding ?x)
        :effect (and 
            (ontable ?x)
            (clear ?x) 
            (handempty)
            (not (holding ?x))
        )
    )

    ;; 3. Unstack block X from block Y 
    (:action unstack
        :parameters (?x - block ?y - block)
        :precondition (and 
            (on ?x ?y)
            (clear ?x)
            (handempty)
        )
        :effect (and 
            (not (on ?x ?y))
            (not (clear ?x)) 
            (clear ?y)
            (holding ?x)
            (not (handempty))
        )
    )

    ;; 4. Stack block X (held) onto block Y
    (:action stack
        :parameters (?x - block ?y - block)
        :precondition (and 
            (holding ?x)
            (clear ?y)
        )
        :effect (and 
            (on ?x ?y)
            (clear ?x) 
            (not (clear ?y))
            (handempty)
            (not (holding ?x))
        )
    )
)
</domain>
```

### PDDL Problem Instance

The problem defines four blocks (B, O, Y, R) starting in a tall stack (B on O on Y on R on table) and aims for a partial rearrangement (Y on R on O).

```pddl
<problem>
(define (problem blocks-world-instance-01)
    (:domain blocks-world)
    
    (:objects
        B O Y R - block ; Blue, Orange, Yellow, Red blocks
    )
    
    (:init
        ; Hand State
        (handempty)
        
        ; Initial Stacking Configuration (B on O, O on Y, Y on R, R on table)
        (on B O)
        (on O Y)
        (on Y R)
        (ontable R)
        
        ; Clearance State
        (clear B) ; B is the only clear block initially
    )
    
    (:goal
        (and
            (on R O) ; Red block is on top of the Orange block
            (on Y R) ; Yellow block is on top of the Red block
        )

NATURAL-PLAN sas_plan_0
------------------------------
This is the sequence of actions required by the `robot_arm` to achieve the goal configuration (Red on Orange, Yellow on Red) starting from the initial state (Blue on Orange, Orange on Yellow, Yellow on Red, Red on Table).

The **Orchestrator** instructs the **Robot Arm** to execute the following steps:

1.  **Unstack:** Unstack the Blue block (B) from the Orange block (O).
2.  **Put-Down:** Place the Blue block (B) onto the table.
3.  **Unstack:** Unstack the Orange block (O) from the Yellow block (Y).
4.  **Put-Down:** Place the Orange block (O) onto the table.
5.  **Unstack:** Unstack the Yellow block (Y) from the Red block (R).
6.  **Put-Down:** Place the Yellow block (Y) onto the table.
    *(All blocks are now on the table: B, O, Y, R)*
7.  **Pick-Up:** Pick up the Red block (R) from the table.
8.  **Stack:** Stack the Red block (R) onto the Orange block (O). (Goal achieved: R on O)
9.  **Pick-Up:** Pick up the Yellow block (Y) from the table.
10. **Stack:** Stack the Yellow block (Y) onto the Red block (R). (Goal achieved: Y on R)

Goal State Achieved: The Yellow block is on Red, and the Red block is on Orange. The hand is empty.

PROBLEM
------------------------------
I am playing with a set of blocks where I need to arrange the blocks into stacks. Here are the actions I can do

Pick up a block
Unstack a block from on top of another block
Put down a block
Stack a block on top of another block

I have the following restrictions on my actions:
I can only pick up or unstack one block at a time.
I can only pick up or unstack a block if my hand is empty.
I can only pick up a block if the block is on the table and the block is clear. A block is clear if the block has no other blocks on top of it and if the block is not picked up.
I can only unstack a block from on top of another block if the block I am unstacking was really on top of the other block.
I can only unstack a block from on top of another block if the block I am unstacking is clear.
Once I pick up or unstack a block, I am holding the block.
I can only put down a block that I am holding.
I can only stack a block on top of another block if I am holding the block being stacked.
I can only stack a block on top of another block if the block onto which I am stacking the block is clear.
Once I put down or stack a block, my hand becomes empty.
Once you stack a block on top of a second block, the second block is no longer clear.

[STATEMENT]
As initial conditions I have that, the yellow block is clear, the hand is empty, the red block is on top of the orange block, the orange block is on top of the blue block, the yellow block is on top of the red block and the blue block is on the table.
My goal is to have that the red block is on top of the yellow block and the yellow block is on top of the blue block.

My plan is as follows:

NATURAL-PLAN sas_plan_4
------------------------------
Based on the provided PDDL specification and the calculated plan, here is the sequence of human-readable actions required to achieve the goal configuration (Red on Yellow, Yellow on Blue).

The initial state is: Yellow on Red on Orange on Blue.

| Step | Action Type | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 1 | UNSTACK | Unstack the **yellow** block from the **red** block. (The agent is now holding Yellow.) |
| 2 | PUT-DOWN | Put down the **yellow** block onto the table. (Yellow is now on the table.) |
| 3 | UNSTACK | Unstack the **red** block from the **orange** block. (The agent is now holding Red.) |
| 4 | STACK | Stack the **red** block onto the **yellow** block. (R is now on Y.) |
| 5 | UNSTACK | Unstack the **orange** block from the **blue** block. (The agent is now holding Orange.) |
| 6 | PUT-DOWN | Put down the **orange** block onto the table. (Orange is now on the table.) |
| 7 | UNSTACK | Unstack the **red** block from the **yellow** block. (The agent is now holding Red.) |
| 8 | PUT-DOWN | Put down the **red** block onto the table. (Red is now on the table.) |
| 9 | PICK-UP | Pick up the **yellow** block from the table. (The agent is now holding Yellow.) |
| 10 | STACK | Stack the **yellow** block onto the **blue** block. (Y is now on B.) |
| 11 | PICK-UP | Pick up the **red** block from the table. (The agent is now holding Red.) |
| 12 | STACK | Stack the **red** block onto the **yellow** block. (R is now on Y.) |

The goal state (Red on Yellow, Yellow on Blue) is now achieved.

PROBLEM
------------------------------
I am playing with a set of blocks where I need to arrange the blocks into stacks. Here are the actions I can do

Pick up a block
Unstack a block from on top of another block
Put down a block
Stack a block on top of another block

I have the following restrictions on my actions:
I can only pick up or unstack one block at a time.
I can only pick up or unstack a block if my hand is empty.
I can only pick up a block if the block is on the table and the block is clear. A block is clear if the block has no other blocks on top of it and if the block is not picked up.
I can only unstack a block from on top of another block if the block I am unstacking was really on top of the other block.
I can only unstack a block from on top of another block if the block I am unstacking is clear.
Once I pick up or unstack a block, I am holding the block.
I can only put down a block that I am holding.
I can only stack a block on top of another block if I am holding the block being stacked.
I can only stack a block on top of another block if the block onto which I am stacking the block is clear.
Once I put down or stack a block, my hand becomes empty.
Once you stack a block on top of a second block, the second block is no longer clear.

[STATEMENT]
As initial conditions I have that, the yellow block is clear, the hand is empty, the red block is on top of the orange block, the orange block is on top of the blue block, the yellow block is on top of the red block and the blue block is on the table.
My goal is to have that the red block is on top of the blue block and the yellow block is on top of the orange block.

My plan is as follows:

NATURAL-PLAN sas_plan_1
------------------------------
This task requires rearranging four blocks (Yellow, Red, Orange, Blue) from the initial configuration (Yellow on Red, Red on Orange, Orange on Blue, Blue on the table) to the target configuration (Red on Blue, and Yellow on Orange).

Here is the sequence of human-readable actions required to achieve the goal:

| Step | Action | Description |
| :---: | :--- | :--- |
| 1 | `(unstack yellow red)` | Unstack the Yellow block from the Red block. (Hand is now holding Yellow.) |
| 2 | `(put-down yellow)` | Place the Yellow block down onto the table. (Hand is now empty.) |
| 3 | `(unstack red orange)` | Unstack the Red block from the Orange block. (Hand is now holding Red.) |
| 4 | `(put-down red)` | Place the Red block down onto the table. (Hand is now empty.) |
| 5 | `(unstack orange blue)` | Unstack the Orange block from the Blue block. (Hand is now holding Orange.) |
| 6 | `(put-down orange)` | Place the Orange block down onto the table. (Hand is now empty. All blocks are now on the table.) |
| 7 | `(pick-up red)` | Pick up the Red block from the table. (Hand is now holding Red.) |
| 8 | `(stack red blue)` | Stack the Red block onto the Blue block. (Hand is now empty.) |
| 9 | `(pick-up yellow)` | Pick up the Yellow block from the table. (Hand is now holding Yellow.) |
| 10 | `(stack yellow orange)` | Stack the Yellow block onto the Orange block. (Hand is now empty.) |

**Goal achieved:** Red is on Blue, and Yellow is on Orange. The hand is empty.

PROBLEM
------------------------------
I am playing with a set of blocks where I need to arrange the blocks into stacks. Here are the actions I can do

Pick up a block
Unstack a block from on top of another block
Put down a block
Stack a block on top of another block

I have the following restrictions on my actions:
I can only pick up or unstack one block at a time.
I can only pick up or unstack a block if my hand is empty.
I can only pick up a block if the block is on the table and the block is clear. A block is clear if the block has no other blocks on top of it and if the block is not picked up.
I can only unstack a block from on top of another block if the block I am unstacking was really on top of the other block.
I can only unstack a block from on top of another block if the block I am unstacking is clear.
Once I pick up or unstack a block, I am holding the block.
I can only put down a block that I am holding.
I can only stack a block on top of another block if I am holding the block being stacked.
I can only stack a block on top of another block if the block onto which I am stacking the block is clear.
Once I put down or stack a block, my hand becomes empty.
Once you stack a block on top of a second block, the second block is no longer clear.

[STATEMENT]
As initial conditions I have that, the blue block is clear, the orange block is clear, the hand is empty, the orange block is on top of the yellow block, the yellow block is on top of the red block, the red block is on the table and the blue block is on the table.
My goal is to have that the red block is on top of the orange block, the blue block is on top of the red block and the yellow block is on top of the blue block.

My plan is as follows:

I can only stack a block on top of another block if the block onto which I am stacking the block is clear.
Once I put down or stack a block, my hand becomes empty.
Once you stack a block on top of a second block, the second block is no longer clear.

[STATEMENT]
As initial conditions I have that, the blue block is clear, the orange block is clear, the hand is empty, the orange block is on top of the yellow block, the yellow block is on top of the red block, the red block is on the table and the blue block is on the table.
My goal is to have that the red block is on top of the orange block, the blue block is on top of the red block and the yellow block is on top of the blue block.

My plan is as follows:

NATURAL-PLAN sas_plan_2
------------------------------
This is the sequence of human-readable instructions derived from the PDDL plan, translating the steps required to move the blocks from the initial state to the goal state (Red on Orange, Blue on Red, Yellow on Blue).

| Step | Action | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 1 | `(unstack orange yellow)` | Unstack the **ORANGE** block from the **YELLOW** block. |
| 2 | `(put-down orange)` | Put down the **ORANGE** block onto the table. |
| 3 | `(unstack yellow red)` | Unstack the **YELLOW** block from the **RED** block. |
| 4 | `(stack yellow blue)` | Stack the **YELLOW** block onto the **BLUE** block. |
| 5 | `(pick-up red)` | Pick up the **RED** block from the table. |
| 6 | `(stack red orange)` | Stack the **RED** block onto the **ORANGE** block. |
| 7 | `(unstack yellow blue)` | Unstack the **YELLOW** block from the **BLUE** block. |
| 8 | `(put-down yellow)` | Put down the **YELLOW** block onto the table. |
| 9 | `(pick-up blue)` | Pick up the **BLUE** block from the table. |
| 10 | `(stack blue red)` | Stack the **BLUE** block onto the **RED** block. |
| 11 | `(pick-up yellow)` | Pick up the **YELLOW** block from the table. |
| 12 | `(stack yellow blue)` | Stack the **YELLOW** block onto the **BLUE** block. |

PROBLEM
------------------------------
I am playing with a set of blocks where I need to arrange the blocks into stacks. Here are the actions I can do

Pick up a block
Unstack a block from on top of another block
Put down a block
Stack a block on top of another block

I have the following restrictions on my actions:
I can only pick up or unstack one block at a time.
I can only pick up or unstack a block if my hand is empty.
I can only pick up a block if the block is on the table and the block is clear. A block is clear if the block has no other blocks on top of it and if the block is not picked up.
I can only unstack a block from on top of another block if the block I am unstacking was really on top of the other block.
I can only unstack a block from on top of another block if the block I am unstacking is clear.
Once I pick up or unstack a block, I am holding the block.
I can only put down a block that I am holding.
I can only stack a block on top of another block if I am holding the block being stacked.
I can only stack a block on top of another block if the block onto which I am stacking the block is clear.
Once I put down or stack a block, my hand becomes empty.
Once you stack a block on top of a second block, the second block is no longer clear.

[STATEMENT]
As initial conditions I have that, the yellow block is clear, the hand is empty, the red block is on top of the orange block, the blue block is on top of the red block, the yellow block is on top of the blue block and the orange block is on the table.
My goal is to have that the blue block is on top of the orange block and the orange block is on top of the yellow block.

My plan is as follows:

NATURAL-PLAN sas_plan_1
------------------------------
This is the sequence of human-readable actions derived from the provided PDDL plan, which achieves the goal state by manipulating the blocks according to the standard Blocksworld constraints.

| Step | Action |
| :--- | :--- |
| 1 | Unstack the **Yellow** block from the **Blue** block. |
| 2 | Put the **Yellow** block down onto the table. |
| 3 | Unstack the **Blue** block from the **Red** block. |
| 4 | Put the **Blue** block down onto the table. |
| 5 | Unstack the **Red** block from the **Orange** block. |
| 6 | Put the **Red** block down onto the table. |
| 7 | Pick up the **Orange** block from the table. |
| 8 | Stack the **Orange** block onto the **Yellow** block. |
| 9 | Pick up the **Blue** block from the table. |
| 10 | Stack the **Blue** block onto the **Orange** block. |

*(Goal achieved: Blue is on Orange, and Orange is on Yellow.)*

PROBLEM
------------------------------
I am playing with a set of blocks where I need to arrange the blocks into stacks. Here are the actions I can do

Pick up a block
Unstack a block from on top of another block
Put down a block
Stack a block on top of another block

I have the following restrictions on my actions:
I can only pick up or unstack one block at a time.
I can only pick up or unstack a block if my hand is empty.
I can only pick up a block if the block is on the table and the block is clear. A block is clear if the block has no other blocks on top of it and if the block is not picked up.
I can only unstack a block from on top of another block if the block I am unstacking was really on top of the other block.
I can only unstack a block from on top of another block if the block I am unstacking is clear.
Once I pick up or unstack a block, I am holding the block.
I can only put down a block that I am holding.
I can only stack a block on top of another block if I am holding the block being stacked.
I can only stack a block on top of another block if the block onto which I am stacking the block is clear.
Once I put down or stack a block, my hand becomes empty.
Once you stack a block on top of a second block, the second block is no longer clear.

[STATEMENT]
As initial conditions I have that, the red block is clear, the orange block is clear, the hand is empty, the red block is on top of the blue block, the blue block is on top of the yellow block, the orange block is on the table and the yellow block is on the table.
My goal is to have that the blue block is on top of the yellow block, the orange block is on top of the red block and the yellow block is on top of the orange block.

My plan is as follows:

NATURAL-PLAN sas_plan_1
------------------------------
This is the sequence of natural language instructions derived from the PDDL plan to achieve the target block configuration.

The initial state is: A stack of Red on Blue on Yellow (with Yellow resting on the table), and Orange resting separately on the table.

The goal is to achieve the structure: Blue on Yellow on Orange on Red (with Red resting on the table).

| Step | Action | Description |
|---|---|---|
| 1. | UNSTACK RED BLUE | Unstack the **red** block from the **blue** block. (The agent is now holding red.) |
| 2. | PUT-DOWN RED | Place the **red** block down onto the table. (The hand is now empty.) |
| 3. | PICK-UP ORANGE | Pick up the **orange** block from the table. (The agent is now holding orange.) |
| 4. | STACK ORANGE RED | Stack the **orange** block onto the **red** block. (Orange is now on Red; the hand is empty.) |
| 5. | UNSTACK BLUE YELLOW | Unstack the **blue** block from the **yellow** block. (The agent is now holding blue.) |
| 6. | PUT-DOWN BLUE | Place the **blue** block down onto the table. (The hand is now empty.) |
| 7. | PICK-UP YELLOW | Pick up the **yellow** block from the table. (The agent is now holding yellow.) |
| 8. | STACK YELLOW ORANGE | Stack the **yellow** block onto the **orange** block. (Yellow is now on Orange; the hand is empty.) |
| 9. | PICK-UP BLUE | Pick up the **blue** block from the table. (The agent is now holding blue.) |
| 10. | STACK BLUE YELLOW | Stack the **blue** block onto the **yellow** block. (Blue is now on Yellow; the hand is empty.) |

The final arrangement is Blue on Yellow on Orange on Red, satisfying the goal state.

PROBLEM
------------------------------
I am playing with a set of blocks where I need to arrange the blocks into stacks. Here are the actions I can do

Pick up a block
Unstack a block from on top of another block
Put down a block
Stack a block on top of another block

I have the following restrictions on my actions:
I can only pick up or unstack one block at a time.
I can only pick up or unstack a block if my hand is empty.
I can only pick up a block if the block is on the table and the block is clear. A block is clear if the block has no other blocks on top of it and if the block is not picked up.
I can only unstack a block from on top of another block if the block I am unstacking was really on top of the other block.
I can only unstack a block from on top of another block if the block I am unstacking is clear.
Once I pick up or unstack a block, I am holding the block.
I can only put down a block that I am holding.
I can only stack a block on top of another block if I am holding the block being stacked.
I can only stack a block on top of another block if the block onto which I am stacking the block is clear.
Once I put down or stack a block, my hand becomes empty.
Once you stack a block on top of a second block, the second block is no longer clear.

[STATEMENT]
As initial conditions I have that, the red block is clear, the orange block is clear, the hand is empty, the red block is on top of the yellow block, the orange block is on top of the blue block, the blue block is on the table and the yellow block is on the table.
My goal is to have that the blue block is on top of the red block, the orange block is on top of the blue block and the yellow block is on top of the orange block.

My plan is as follows:

NATURAL-PLAN sas_plan_1
------------------------------
This is the sequence of actions required to transform the initial block configuration into the desired goal state (R table -> B -> O -> Y), derived directly from the PDDL plan.

The blocks are identified as: R (Red), O (Orange), B (Blue), Y (Yellow).

1.  **Unstack R from Y:** Unstack the Red block (R) from the Yellow block (Y).
2.  **Put down R:** Place the Red block (R) onto the table.
3.  **Unstack O from B:** Unstack the Orange block (O) from the Blue block (B).
4.  **Put down O:** Place the Orange block (O) onto the table.
5.  **Pick up B:** Pick up the Blue block (B) from the table.
6.  **Stack B onto R:** Stack the Blue block (B) onto the Red block (R).
7.  **Pick up O:** Pick up the Orange block (O) from the table.
8.  **Stack O onto B:** Stack the Orange block (O) onto the Blue block (B).
9.  **Pick up Y:** Pick up the Yellow block (Y) from the table.
10. **Stack Y onto O:** Stack the Yellow block (Y) onto the Orange block (O).

The final configuration is achieved: R is on the table, B is on R, O is on B, and Y is on O.
