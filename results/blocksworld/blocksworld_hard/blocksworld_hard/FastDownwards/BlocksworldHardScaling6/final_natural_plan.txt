This is the sequence of actions required to transform the initial block configuration into the desired goal state (R table -> B -> O -> Y), derived directly from the PDDL plan.

The blocks are identified as: R (Red), O (Orange), B (Blue), Y (Yellow).

1.  **Unstack R from Y:** Unstack the Red block (R) from the Yellow block (Y).
2.  **Put down R:** Place the Red block (R) onto the table.
3.  **Unstack O from B:** Unstack the Orange block (O) from the Blue block (B).
4.  **Put down O:** Place the Orange block (O) onto the table.
5.  **Pick up B:** Pick up the Blue block (B) from the table.
6.  **Stack B onto R:** Stack the Blue block (B) onto the Red block (R).
7.  **Pick up O:** Pick up the Orange block (O) from the table.
8.  **Stack O onto B:** Stack the Orange block (O) onto the Blue block (B).
9.  **Pick up Y:** Pick up the Yellow block (Y) from the table.
10. **Stack Y onto O:** Stack the Yellow block (Y) onto the Orange block (O).

The final configuration is achieved: R is on the table, B is on R, O is on B, and Y is on O.
