PROBLEM
------------------------------
I am playing with a set of blocks where I need to arrange the blocks into stacks. Here are the actions I can do

Pick up a block
Unstack a block from on top of another block
Put down a block
Stack a block on top of another block

I have the following restrictions on my actions:
I can only pick up or unstack one block at a time.
I can only pick up or unstack a block if my hand is empty.
I can only pick up a block if the block is on the table and the block is clear. A block is clear if the block has no other blocks on top of it and if the block is not picked up.
I can only unstack a block from on top of another block if the block I am unstacking was really on top of the other block.
I can only unstack a block from on top of another block if the block I am unstacking is clear.
Once I pick up or unstack a block, I am holding the block.
I can only put down a block that I am holding.
I can only stack a block on top of another block if I am holding the block being stacked.
I can only stack a block on top of another block if the block onto which I am stacking the block is clear.
Once I put down or stack a block, my hand becomes empty.
Once you stack a block on top of a second block, the second block is no longer clear.

[STATEMENT]
As initial conditions I have that, the blue block is clear, the yellow block is clear, the hand is empty, the red block is on top of the orange block, the blue block is on top of the red block, the orange block is on the table and the yellow block is on the table.
My goal is to have that the red block is on top of the blue block, the blue block is on top of the yellow block and the yellow block is on top of the orange block.

My plan is as follows:

NATURAL-PLAN sas_plan_2
------------------------------
This plan describes the sequence of actions required to rearrange the colored blocks from the initial configuration (Blue-Red-Orange stack and Yellow on the table) to the goal configuration (Red-Blue-Yellow-Orange stack).

Here is the sequence of human-readable instructions derived from the PDDL plan:

| Step | Time | Instruction |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 1 | T+0 | **Unstack** the **blue** block from the **red** block. (The blue block is now held.) |
| 2 | T+1 | **Stack** the held **blue** block onto the **yellow** block. |
| 3 | T+2 | **Unstack** the **red** block from the **orange** block. (The red block is now held.) |
| 4 | T+3 | **Put down** the held **red** block onto the table. |
| 5 | T+4 | **Unstack** the **blue** block from the **yellow** block. (The blue block is now held.) |
| 6 | T+5 | **Put down** the held **blue** block onto the table. |
| 7 | T+6 | **Pick up** the **yellow** block from the table. (The yellow block is now held.) |
| 8 | T+7 | **Stack** the held **yellow** block onto the **orange** block. |
| 9 | T+8 | **Pick up** the **blue** block from the table. (The blue block is now held.) |
| 10 | T+9 | **Stack** the held **blue** block onto the **yellow** block. |
| 11 | T+10 | **Pick up** the **red** block from the table. (The red block is now held.) |
| 12 | T+11 | **Stack** the held **red** block onto the **blue** block. |

The final configuration is achieved: Red is on Blue, Blue is on Yellow, Yellow is on Orange, and Orange is on the table.
