This plan describes the sequence of actions required to rearrange the colored blocks from the initial configuration (Blue-Red-Orange stack and Yellow on the table) to the goal configuration (Red-Blue-Yellow-Orange stack).

Here is the sequence of human-readable instructions derived from the PDDL plan:

| Step | Time | Instruction |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 1 | T+0 | **Unstack** the **blue** block from the **red** block. (The blue block is now held.) |
| 2 | T+1 | **Stack** the held **blue** block onto the **yellow** block. |
| 3 | T+2 | **Unstack** the **red** block from the **orange** block. (The red block is now held.) |
| 4 | T+3 | **Put down** the held **red** block onto the table. |
| 5 | T+4 | **Unstack** the **blue** block from the **yellow** block. (The blue block is now held.) |
| 6 | T+5 | **Put down** the held **blue** block onto the table. |
| 7 | T+6 | **Pick up** the **yellow** block from the table. (The yellow block is now held.) |
| 8 | T+7 | **Stack** the held **yellow** block onto the **orange** block. |
| 9 | T+8 | **Pick up** the **blue** block from the table. (The blue block is now held.) |
| 10 | T+9 | **Stack** the held **blue** block onto the **yellow** block. |
| 11 | T+10 | **Pick up** the **red** block from the table. (The red block is now held.) |
| 12 | T+11 | **Stack** the held **red** block onto the **blue** block. |

The final configuration is achieved: Red is on Blue, Blue is on Yellow, Yellow is on Orange, and Orange is on the table.
