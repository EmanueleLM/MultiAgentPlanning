Based on the provided PDDL domain, problem, and plan, here is the sequence of human-readable instructions to achieve the goal state (Block B on Block Y, and Block Y on Block R).

The initial state is:
*   Block R is on Block Y.
*   Block B is on Block O.
*   Blocks Y and O are on the table.
*   The hand is empty.

**Goal:** Stack B onto Y, and Y onto R.

| Step | PDDL Action | Human Instruction |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 1 | `(unstack r y)` | **Unstack** Block R from Block Y. (Now holding R.) |
| 2 | `(put-down r)` | **Place** Block R down onto the table. (Hand is now empty.) |
| 3 | `(pick-up y)` | **Pick up** Block Y from the table. (Now holding Y.) |
| 4 | `(stack y r)` | **Stack** Block Y onto Block R. (Hand is now empty. R is no longer clear.) |
| 5 | `(unstack b o)` | **Unstack** Block B from Block O. (Now holding B. O is now clear.) |
| 6 | `(stack b y)` | **Stack** Block B onto Block Y. (Hand is now empty. Y is no longer clear.) |

**Plan Completed.**
