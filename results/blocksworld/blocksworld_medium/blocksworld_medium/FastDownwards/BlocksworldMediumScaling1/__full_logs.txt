PROBLEM
------------------------------
I am playing with a set of blocks where I need to arrange the blocks into stacks. Here are the actions I can do

Pick up a block
Unstack a block from on top of another block
Put down a block
Stack a block on top of another block

I have the following restrictions on my actions:
I can only pick up or unstack one block at a time.
I can only pick up or unstack a block if my hand is empty.
I can only pick up a block if the block is on the table and the block is clear. A block is clear if the block has no other blocks on top of it and if the block is not picked up.
I can only unstack a block from on top of another block if the block I am unstacking was really on top of the other block.
I can only unstack a block from on top of another block if the block I am unstacking is clear.
Once I pick up or unstack a block, I am holding the block.
I can only put down a block that I am holding.
I can only stack a block on top of another block if I am holding the block being stacked.
I can only stack a block on top of another block if the block onto which I am stacking the block is clear.
Once I put down or stack a block, my hand becomes empty.
Once you stack a block on top of a second block, the second block is no longer clear.

[STATEMENT]
As initial conditions I have that, the red block is clear, the blue block is clear, the hand is empty, the red block is on top of the yellow block, the blue block is on top of the orange block, the orange block is on the table and the yellow block is on the table.
My goal is to have that the blue block is on top of the yellow block and the yellow block is on top of the red block.

My plan is as follows:

NATURAL-PLAN sas_plan_1
------------------------------
Based on the provided PDDL domain, problem, and plan, here is the sequence of human-readable instructions to achieve the goal state (Block B on Block Y, and Block Y on Block R).

The initial state is:
*   Block R is on Block Y.
*   Block B is on Block O.
*   Blocks Y and O are on the table.
*   The hand is empty.

**Goal:** Stack B onto Y, and Y onto R.

| Step | PDDL Action | Human Instruction |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 1 | `(unstack r y)` | **Unstack** Block R from Block Y. (Now holding R.) |
| 2 | `(put-down r)` | **Place** Block R down onto the table. (Hand is now empty.) |
| 3 | `(pick-up y)` | **Pick up** Block Y from the table. (Now holding Y.) |
| 4 | `(stack y r)` | **Stack** Block Y onto Block R. (Hand is now empty. R is no longer clear.) |
| 5 | `(unstack b o)` | **Unstack** Block B from Block O. (Now holding B. O is now clear.) |
| 6 | `(stack b y)` | **Stack** Block B onto Block Y. (Hand is now empty. Y is no longer clear.) |

**Plan Completed.**

PROBLEM
------------------------------
I am playing with a set of blocks where I need to arrange the blocks into stacks. Here are the actions I can do

Pick up a block
Unstack a block from on top of another block
Put down a block
Stack a block on top of another block

I have the following restrictions on my actions:
I can only pick up or unstack one block at a time.
I can only pick up or unstack a block if my hand is empty.
I can only pick up a block if the block is on the table and the block is clear. A block is clear if the block has no other blocks on top of it and if the block is not picked up.
I can only unstack a block from on top of another block if the block I am unstacking was really on top of the other block.
I can only unstack a block from on top of another block if the block I am unstacking is clear.
Once I pick up or unstack a block, I am holding the block.
I can only put down a block that I am holding.
I can only stack a block on top of another block if I am holding the block being stacked.
I can only stack a block on top of another block if the block onto which I am stacking the block is clear.
Once I put down or stack a block, my hand becomes empty.
Once you stack a block on top of a second block, the second block is no longer clear.

[STATEMENT]
As initial conditions I have that, the orange block is clear, the yellow block is clear, the hand is empty, the orange block is on top of the blue block, the yellow block is on top of the red block, the red block is on the table and the blue block is on the table.
My goal is to have that the red block is on top of the blue block.

My plan is as follows:

NATURAL-PLAN sas_plan_4
------------------------------
This is the sequence of human-readable instructions derived from the provided PDDL plan, starting from the initial configuration (Orange on Blue, Yellow on Red, both Blue and Red stacks on the Table) to achieve the goal state (Red on Blue).

| Step | Action | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 1 | **Unstack** | Unstack the **Orange** block from the **Blue** block. (Now holding Orange, Blue is clear.) |
| 2 | **Put Down** | Put the **Orange** block down onto the Table. (Orange is now on the Table and clear, hand is empty.) |
| 3 | **Unstack** | Unstack the **Yellow** block from the **Red** block. (Now holding Yellow, Red is clear.) |
| 4 | **Put Down** | Put the **Yellow** block down onto the Table. (Yellow is now on the Table and clear, hand is empty.) |
| 5 | **Pick Up** | Pick up the **Red** block from the Table. (Now holding Red.) |
| 6 | **Stack** | Stack the **Red** block onto the **Blue** block. (Goal achieved: Red is on Blue, hand is empty.) |
