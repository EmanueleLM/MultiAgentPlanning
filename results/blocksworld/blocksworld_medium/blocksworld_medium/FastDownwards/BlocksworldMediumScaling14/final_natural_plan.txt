This is the sequence of human-readable actions required to achieve the goal state, based directly on the provided PDDL plan.

The objects involved are the blocks: R, B, Y, and O.

1.  **Unstack Block B from Block O:** Lift B, which is currently resting on O.
2.  **Put Block B Down:** Place block B directly onto the table.
3.  **Pick Up Block R:** Lift block R from the table.
4.  **Stack Block R onto Block B:** Place the block R onto the top of block B.
5.  **Pick Up Block Y:** Lift block Y from the table.
6.  **Stack Block Y onto Block O:** Place the block Y onto the top of block O.
7.  **Unstack Block R from Block B:** Lift R, which is currently resting on B.
8.  **Put Block R Down:** Place block R directly onto the table.
9.  **Pick Up Block B:** Lift block B from the table.
10. **Stack Block B onto Block Y:** Place the block B onto the top of block Y. (Y is now on O, so this forms B-Y-O stack).
11. **Pick Up Block R:** Lift block R from the table.
12. **Stack Block R onto Block B:** Place the block R onto the top of block B.

***
*The goal state (R on B, B on Y, Y on O) is achieved.*
