This is a sequence of 31 actions required to transfer all five disks (A, B, C, D, E) from the Right peg (R) to the Middle peg (M), following the constraints of the Tower of Hanoi puzzle.

### Instructions (5-Disk Tower of Hanoi: R $\rightarrow$ M)

| 4 | `(move-disk-to-peg c d m)` | Move disk **C** (currently on D) to Peg **M**. |
| 5 | `(move-disk-to-disk a b d)` | Move disk **A** (currently on B) onto disk **D**. |
| 6 | `(move-disk-to-disk b l c)` | Move disk **B** (currently on L) onto disk **C**. |
| 7 | `(move-disk-to-disk a d b)` | Move disk **A** (currently on D) onto disk **B**. |
| 8 | `(move-disk-to-peg d e l)` | Move disk **D** (currently on E) to Peg **L**. |
| 9 | `(move-disk-to-disk a b d)` | Move disk **A** (currently on B) onto disk **D**. |
| 10 | `(move-disk-to-disk b c e)` | Move disk **B** (currently on C) onto disk **E**. |
| 11 | `(move-disk-to-disk a d b)` | Move disk **A** (currently on D) onto disk **B**. |
| 12 | `(move-disk-to-disk c m d)` | Move disk **C** (currently on M) onto disk **D**. |
| 13 | `(move-disk-to-peg a b m)` | Move disk **A** (currently on B) to Peg **M**. |
| 14 | `(move-disk-to-disk b e c)` | Move disk **B** (currently on E) onto disk **C**. |
| 15 | `(move-disk-to-disk a m b)` | Move disk **A** (currently on M) onto disk **B**. |
| 16 | `(move-disk-to-peg e r m)` | Move disk **E** (currently on R) to Peg **M**. |
| 17 | `(move-disk-to-peg a b r)` | Move disk **A** (currently on B) to Peg **R**. |
| 18 | `(move-disk-to-disk b c e)` | Move disk **B** (currently on C) onto disk **E**. |
| 19 | `(move-disk-to-disk a r b)` | Move disk **A** (currently on R) onto disk **B**. |
| 20 | `(move-disk-to-peg c d r)` | Move disk **C** (currently on D) to Peg **R**. |
| 21 | `(move-disk-to-disk a b d)` | Move disk **A** (currently on B) onto disk **D**. |
| 22 | `(move-disk-to-disk b e c)` | Move disk **B** (currently on E) onto disk **C**. |
| 23 | `(move-disk-to-disk a d b)` | Move disk **A** (currently on D) onto disk **B**. |
| 24 | `(move-disk-to-disk d l e)` | Move disk **D** (currently on L) onto disk **E**. |
| 25 | `(move-disk-to-disk a b d)` | Move disk **A** (currently on B) onto disk **D**. |
| 26 | `(move-disk-to-peg b c l)` | Move disk **B** (currently on C) to Peg **L**. |
| 27 | `(move-disk-to-disk a d b)` | Move disk **A** (currently on D) onto disk **B**. |
| 28 | `(move-disk-to-disk c r d)` | Move disk **C** (currently on R) onto disk **D**. |
| 29 | `(move-disk-to-peg a b r)` | Move disk **A** (currently on B) to Peg **R**. |
| 30 | `(move-disk-to-disk b l c)` | Move disk **B** (currently on L) onto disk **C**. |
| 31 | `(move-disk-to-disk a r b)` | Move disk **A** (currently on R) onto disk **B**. |

**Goal State Achieved:** All disks (A, B, C, D, E) are now stacked correctly on the Middle peg (M), with E at the bottom and A at the top. The Left (L) and Right (R) pegs are empty.
