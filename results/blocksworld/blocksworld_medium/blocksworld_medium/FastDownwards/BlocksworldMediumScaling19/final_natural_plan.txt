This is a plan to reconfigure a set of colored blocks on a table. The system must move the blocks one at a time to achieve the target configuration.

The sequence of actions is as follows:

1.  **Unstack Yellow from Orange.** (The agent takes Yellow, which was resting on Orange, and is now holding Yellow.)
2.  **Put down Yellow.** (The agent places Yellow onto the table.)
3.  **Unstack Orange from Red.** (The agent takes Orange, which was resting on Red, and is now holding Orange.)
4.  **Put down Orange.** (The agent places Orange onto the table.)
5.  **Pick up Blue.** (The agent picks up Blue from the table.)
6.  **Stack Blue onto Orange.** (The agent places the held block, Blue, on top of Orange.)
7.  **Pick up Yellow.** (The agent picks up Yellow from the table.)
8.  **Stack Yellow onto Red.** (The agent places the held block, Yellow, on top of Red.)
