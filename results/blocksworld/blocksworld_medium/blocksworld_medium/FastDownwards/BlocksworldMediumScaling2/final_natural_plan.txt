This task requires rearranging the four blocks (Red, Orange, Blue, Yellow) from the initial configuration to achieve the goal state: Red (R) on Orange (O), and Blue (B) on Red (R).

The following sequence of 6 actions achieves the goal:

1.  **Unstack Orange (O) from Blue (B):** Pick up the Orange block (O), which is currently resting on Blue (B).
2.  **Put Down Orange (O):** Place the Orange block (O) onto the table.
3.  **Pick Up Red (R):** Pick up the Red block (R) from the table.
4.  **Stack Red (R) onto Orange (O):** Place the held Red block (R) onto the Orange block (O).
5.  **Unstack Blue (B) from Yellow (Y):** Pick up the Blue block (B), which is currently resting on Yellow (Y).
6.  **Stack Blue (B) onto Red (R):** Place the held Blue block (B) onto the Red block (R).

The goal state is now achieved: Blue is on Red, and Red is on Orange.
