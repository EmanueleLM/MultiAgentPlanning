This sequence of actions translates the PDDL plan into human-readable instructions to achieve the goal: Orange on Red, and Yellow on Blue.

**Initial State:** A stack exists where Red is on Blue, Blue is on Yellow, and Yellow is on Orange. Orange is on the table.

| Step | Action | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |

| 2 | `(put-down r)` | Put down the **Red** block onto the table. |
| 3 | `(unstack b y)` | Unstack the **Blue** block from the **Yellow** block. (The agent is now holding Blue.) |
| 4 | `(put-down b)` | Put down the **Blue** block onto the table. |
| 5 | `(unstack y o)` | Unstack the **Yellow** block from the **Orange** block. (The agent is now holding Yellow.) |
| 6 | `(stack y b)` | Stack the **Yellow** block onto the **Blue** block. (Goal condition `(on y b)` achieved.) |
| 7 | `(pick-up o)` | Pick up the **Orange** block from the table. (The agent is now holding Orange.) |
| 8 | `(stack o r)` | Stack the **Orange** block onto the **Red** block. (Goal condition `(on o r)` achieved.) |

The final configuration satisfies the goal state: Orange is on Red, and Yellow is on Blue. (Total actions taken: 8)
