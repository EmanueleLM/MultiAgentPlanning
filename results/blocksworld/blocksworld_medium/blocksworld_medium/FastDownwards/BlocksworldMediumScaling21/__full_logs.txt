PROBLEM
------------------------------
I am playing with a set of blocks where I need to arrange the blocks into stacks. Here are the actions I can do

Pick up a block
Unstack a block from on top of another block
Put down a block
Stack a block on top of another block

I have the following restrictions on my actions:
I can only pick up or unstack one block at a time.
I can only pick up or unstack a block if my hand is empty.
I can only pick up a block if the block is on the table and the block is clear. A block is clear if the block has no other blocks on top of it and if the block is not picked up.
I can only unstack a block from on top of another block if the block I am unstacking was really on top of the other block.
I can only unstack a block from on top of another block if the block I am unstacking is clear.
Once I pick up or unstack a block, I am holding the block.
I can only put down a block that I am holding.
I can only stack a block on top of another block if I am holding the block being stacked.
I can only stack a block on top of another block if the block onto which I am stacking the block is clear.
Once I put down or stack a block, my hand becomes empty.
Once you stack a block on top of a second block, the second block is no longer clear.

[STATEMENT]
As initial conditions I have that, the red block is clear, the blue block is clear, the hand is empty, the blue block is on top of the yellow block, the yellow block is on top of the orange block, the red block is on the table and the orange block is on the table.
My goal is to have that the blue block is on top of the red block and the orange block is on top of the blue block.

My plan is as follows:

NATURAL-PLAN sas_plan_1
------------------------------
This plan details the steps required to achieve the target configuration in the blocksworld environment.

**Goal:** Achieve the stack configuration (Orange on Blue on Red) from the initial configuration (Blue on Yellow on Orange, and Red on Table).

| Step | Action | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 1 | `(unstack blue yellow)` | Unstack Block BLUE from the top of Block YELLOW. (Hand now holds BLUE.) |
| 2 | `(stack blue red)` | Stack Block BLUE onto Block RED. (RED is now the base of a new stack.) |
| 3 | `(unstack yellow orange)` | Unstack Block YELLOW from the top of Block ORANGE. (Hand now holds YELLOW.) |
| 4 | `(put-down yellow)` | Put down Block YELLOW onto the table. |
| 5 | `(pick-up orange)` | Pick up Block ORANGE from the table. (ORANGE was the base of the original stack.) |
| 6 | `(stack orange blue)` | Stack Block ORANGE onto Block BLUE. (The final goal stack [Orange, Blue, Red] is complete.) |

PROBLEM
------------------------------
I am playing with a set of blocks where I need to arrange the blocks into stacks. Here are the actions I can do

Pick up a block
Unstack a block from on top of another block
Put down a block
Stack a block on top of another block

I have the following restrictions on my actions:
I can only pick up or unstack one block at a time.
I can only pick up or unstack a block if my hand is empty.
I can only pick up a block if the block is on the table and the block is clear. A block is clear if the block has no other blocks on top of it and if the block is not picked up.
I can only unstack a block from on top of another block if the block I am unstacking was really on top of the other block.
I can only unstack a block from on top of another block if the block I am unstacking is clear.
Once I pick up or unstack a block, I am holding the block.
I can only put down a block that I am holding.
I can only stack a block on top of another block if I am holding the block being stacked.
I can only stack a block on top of another block if the block onto which I am stacking the block is clear.
Once I put down or stack a block, my hand becomes empty.
Once you stack a block on top of a second block, the second block is no longer clear.

[STATEMENT]
As initial conditions I have that, the blue block is clear, the orange block is clear, the yellow block is clear, the hand is empty, the blue block is on top of the red block, the red block is on the table, the orange block is on the table and the yellow block is on the table.
My goal is to have that the red block is on top of the blue block, the blue block is on top of the orange block and the yellow block is on top of the red block.

My plan is as follows:

NATURAL-PLAN sas_plan_2
------------------------------
This plan outlines the steps required to rearrange the blocks from the initial configuration (Blue on Red, Orange and Yellow on the table) to the target configuration (Yellow on Red, Red on Blue, Blue on Orange).

| Step | Action | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 1 | `(unstack blue red)` | **Unstack** the block named 'blue' from the block named 'red'. (Now holding 'blue'). |
| 2 | `(stack blue orange)` | **Stack** the block 'blue' (currently held) onto the block named 'orange'. |
| 3 | `(pick-up red)` | **Pick up** the block named 'red' from the table. (Now holding 'red'). |
| 4 | `(stack red blue)` | **Stack** the block 'red' (currently held) onto the block named 'blue'. |
| 5 | `(pick-up yellow)` | **Pick up** the block named 'yellow' from the table. (Now holding 'yellow'). |
| 6 | `(stack yellow red)` | **Stack** the block 'yellow' (currently held) onto the block named 'red'. |

PROBLEM
------------------------------
I am playing with a set of blocks where I need to arrange the blocks into stacks. Here are the actions I can do

Pick up a block
Unstack a block from on top of another block
Put down a block
Stack a block on top of another block

I have the following restrictions on my actions:
I can only pick up or unstack one block at a time.
I can only pick up or unstack a block if my hand is empty.
I can only pick up a block if the block is on the table and the block is clear. A block is clear if the block has no other blocks on top of it and if the block is not picked up.
I can only unstack a block from on top of another block if the block I am unstacking was really on top of the other block.
I can only unstack a block from on top of another block if the block I am unstacking is clear.
Once I pick up or unstack a block, I am holding the block.
I can only put down a block that I am holding.
I can only stack a block on top of another block if I am holding the block being stacked.
I can only stack a block on top of another block if the block onto which I am stacking the block is clear.
Once I put down or stack a block, my hand becomes empty.
Once you stack a block on top of a second block, the second block is no longer clear.

[STATEMENT]
As initial conditions I have that, the orange block is clear, the hand is empty, the red block is on top of the yellow block, the blue block is on top of the red block, the orange block is on top of the blue block and the yellow block is on the table.
My goal is to have that the red block is on top of the blue block.

My plan is as follows:

PROBLEM
------------------------------
I am playing with a set of blocks where I need to arrange the blocks into stacks. Here are the actions I can do

Pick up a block
Unstack a block from on top of another block
Put down a block
Stack a block on top of another block

I have the following restrictions on my actions:
I can only pick up or unstack one block at a time.
I can only pick up or unstack a block if my hand is empty.
I can only pick up a block if the block is on the table and the block is clear. A block is clear if the block has no other blocks on top of it and if the block is not picked up.
I can only unstack a block from on top of another block if the block I am unstacking was really on top of the other block.
I can only unstack a block from on top of another block if the block I am unstacking is clear.
Once I pick up or unstack a block, I am holding the block.
I can only put down a block that I am holding.
I can only stack a block on top of another block if I am holding the block being stacked.
I can only stack a block on top of another block if the block onto which I am stacking the block is clear.
Once I put down or stack a block, my hand becomes empty.
Once you stack a block on top of a second block, the second block is no longer clear.

[STATEMENT]
As initial conditions I have that, the red block is clear, the blue block is clear, the orange block is clear, the hand is empty, the red block is on top of the yellow block, the blue block is on the table, the orange block is on the table and the yellow block is on the table.
My goal is to have that the red block is on top of the blue block and the blue block is on top of the yellow block.

My plan is as follows:

PROBLEM
------------------------------
I am playing with a set of blocks where I need to arrange the blocks into stacks. Here are the actions I can do

Pick up a block
Unstack a block from on top of another block
Put down a block
Stack a block on top of another block

I have the following restrictions on my actions:
I can only pick up or unstack one block at a time.
I can only pick up or unstack a block if my hand is empty.
I can only pick up a block if the block is on the table and the block is clear. A block is clear if the block has no other blocks on top of it and if the block is not picked up.
I can only unstack a block from on top of another block if the block I am unstacking was really on top of the other block.
I can only unstack a block from on top of another block if the block I am unstacking is clear.
Once I pick up or unstack a block, I am holding the block.
I can only put down a block that I am holding.
I can only stack a block on top of another block if I am holding the block being stacked.
I can only stack a block on top of another block if the block onto which I am stacking the block is clear.
Once I put down or stack a block, my hand becomes empty.
Once you stack a block on top of a second block, the second block is no longer clear.

[STATEMENT]
As initial conditions I have that, the red block is clear, the hand is empty, the red block is on top of the blue block, the blue block is on top of the yellow block, the yellow block is on top of the orange block and the orange block is on the table.
My goal is to have that the yellow block is on top of the red block.

My plan is as follows:

NATURAL-PLAN sas_plan_2
------------------------------
Based on the provided PDDL plan for the Blocks World problem, here is the sequence of human-readable instructions required to achieve the goal state (Yellow block placed on Red block):

| Step | PDDL Action | Human Instruction |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **1** | `(unstack red blue)` | Pick up the **Red** block from the **Blue** block. |
| **2** | `(put-down red)` | Place the **Red** block down onto the table. |
| **3** | `(unstack blue yellow)` | Pick up the **Blue** block from the **Yellow** block. |
| **4** | `(put-down blue)` | Place the **Blue** block down onto the table. |
| **5** | `(unstack yellow orange)` | Pick up the **Yellow** block from the **Orange** block. |
| **6** | `(stack yellow red)` | Place (Stack) the **Yellow** block onto the **Red** block. |

PROBLEM
------------------------------
I am playing with a set of blocks where I need to arrange the blocks into stacks. Here are the actions I can do

Pick up a block
Unstack a block from on top of another block
Put down a block
Stack a block on top of another block

I have the following restrictions on my actions:
I can only pick up or unstack one block at a time.
I can only pick up or unstack a block if my hand is empty.
I can only pick up a block if the block is on the table and the block is clear. A block is clear if the block has no other blocks on top of it and if the block is not picked up.
I can only unstack a block from on top of another block if the block I am unstacking was really on top of the other block.
I can only unstack a block from on top of another block if the block I am unstacking is clear.
Once I pick up or unstack a block, I am holding the block.
I can only put down a block that I am holding.
I can only stack a block on top of another block if I am holding the block being stacked.
I can only stack a block on top of another block if the block onto which I am stacking the block is clear.
Once I put down or stack a block, my hand becomes empty.
Once you stack a block on top of a second block, the second block is no longer clear.

[STATEMENT]
As initial conditions I have that, the blue block is clear, the orange block is clear, the yellow block is clear, the hand is empty, the blue block is on top of the red block, the red block is on the table, the orange block is on the table and the yellow block is on the table.
My goal is to have that the blue block is on top of the yellow block and the yellow block is on top of the red block.

My plan is as follows:

PROBLEM
------------------------------
I am playing with a set of blocks where I need to arrange the blocks into stacks. Here are the actions I can do

Pick up a block
Unstack a block from on top of another block
Put down a block
Stack a block on top of another block

I have the following restrictions on my actions:
I can only pick up or unstack one block at a time.
I can only pick up or unstack a block if my hand is empty.
I can only pick up a block if the block is on the table and the block is clear. A block is clear if the block has no other blocks on top of it and if the block is not picked up.
I can only unstack a block from on top of another block if the block I am unstacking was really on top of the other block.
I can only unstack a block from on top of another block if the block I am unstacking is clear.
Once I pick up or unstack a block, I am holding the block.
I can only put down a block that I am holding.
I can only stack a block on top of another block if I am holding the block being stacked.
I can only stack a block on top of another block if the block onto which I am stacking the block is clear.
Once I put down or stack a block, my hand becomes empty.
Once you stack a block on top of a second block, the second block is no longer clear.

[STATEMENT]
As initial conditions I have that, the red block is clear, the blue block is clear, the yellow block is clear, the hand is empty, the red block is on top of the orange block, the blue block is on the table, the orange block is on the table and the yellow block is on the table.
My goal is to have that the blue block is on top of the orange block and the orange block is on top of the yellow block.

My plan is as follows:

NATURAL-PLAN sas_plan_3
------------------------------
This plan details the sequence of movements required to rearrange the blocks according to the goal state defined in the `blocksworld-12` problem.

The initial configuration is:
*   Stack 1: Red (top) on Orange (bottom, on table).
*   Block 2: Blue (on table).
*   Block 3: Yellow (on table).
*   Hand is empty.

The goal is to achieve the stack: Blue on Orange on Yellow.

| Step | PDDL Action | Human-Readable Instruction |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 1 | `(unstack red orange)` | Unstack the **red** block from the **orange** block. (The agent is now holding the red block). |
| 2 | `(put-down red)` | Place the **red** block down onto the table. (The hand is now empty). |
| 3 | `(pick-up orange)` | Pick up the **orange** block from the table. (The agent is now holding the orange block). |
| 4 | `(stack orange yellow)` | Stack the **orange** block on top of the **yellow** block. (Stack: Orange on Yellow). |
| 5 | `(pick-up blue)` | Pick up the **blue** block from the table. (The agent is now holding the blue block). |
| 6 | `(stack blue orange)` | Stack the **blue** block on top of the **orange** block. (Goal achieved: Blue on Orange on Yellow). |

PROBLEM
------------------------------
I am playing with a set of blocks where I need to arrange the blocks into stacks. Here are the actions I can do

Pick up a block
Unstack a block from on top of another block
Put down a block
Stack a block on top of another block

I have the following restrictions on my actions:
I can only pick up or unstack one block at a time.
I can only pick up or unstack a block if my hand is empty.
I can only pick up a block if the block is on the table and the block is clear. A block is clear if the block has no other blocks on top of it and if the block is not picked up.
I can only unstack a block from on top of another block if the block I am unstacking was really on top of the other block.
I can only unstack a block from on top of another block if the block I am unstacking is clear.
Once I pick up or unstack a block, I am holding the block.
I can only put down a block that I am holding.
I can only stack a block on top of another block if I am holding the block being stacked.
I can only stack a block on top of another block if the block onto which I am stacking the block is clear.
Once I put down or stack a block, my hand becomes empty.
Once you stack a block on top of a second block, the second block is no longer clear.

[STATEMENT]
As initial conditions I have that, the red block is clear, the hand is empty, the red block is on top of the yellow block, the blue block is on top of the orange block, the yellow block is on top of the blue block and the orange block is on the table.
My goal is to have that the red block is on top of the orange block.

My plan is as follows:

NATURAL-PLAN sas_plan_1
------------------------------
This sequence of actions describes the movement required to achieve the goal state, starting from the initial configuration where the blocks are stacked in the order Orange (bottom) $\rightarrow$ Blue $\rightarrow$ Yellow $\rightarrow$ Red (top). The goal is to place the Red block directly on the Orange block.

| Step | Action Type | Details (Natural Language Instruction) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 1 | UNSTACK | Pick up the **Red** block from the top of the **Yellow** block. |
| 2 | PUT-DOWN | Place the **Red** block down onto the table. |
| 3 | UNSTACK | Pick up the **Yellow** block from the top of the **Blue** block. |
| 4 | PUT-DOWN | Place the **Yellow** block down onto the table. |
| 5 | UNSTACK | Pick up the **Blue** block from the top of the **Orange** block. |
| 6 | PUT-DOWN | Place the **Blue** block down onto the table. |
| 7 | PICK-UP | Pick up the **Red** block from the table. |
| 8 | STACK | Place the **Red** block onto the **Orange** block. |

PROBLEM
------------------------------
I am playing with a set of blocks where I need to arrange the blocks into stacks. Here are the actions I can do

Pick up a block
Unstack a block from on top of another block
Put down a block
Stack a block on top of another block

I have the following restrictions on my actions:
I can only pick up or unstack one block at a time.
I can only pick up or unstack a block if my hand is empty.
I can only pick up a block if the block is on the table and the block is clear. A block is clear if the block has no other blocks on top of it and if the block is not picked up.
I can only unstack a block from on top of another block if the block I am unstacking was really on top of the other block.
I can only unstack a block from on top of another block if the block I am unstacking is clear.
Once I pick up or unstack a block, I am holding the block.
I can only put down a block that I am holding.
I can only stack a block on top of another block if I am holding the block being stacked.
I can only stack a block on top of another block if the block onto which I am stacking the block is clear.
Once I put down or stack a block, my hand becomes empty.
Once you stack a block on top of a second block, the second block is no longer clear.

[STATEMENT]
As initial conditions I have that, the red block is clear, the blue block is clear, the yellow block is clear, the hand is empty, the blue block is on top of the orange block, the red block is on the table, the orange block is on the table and the yellow block is on the table.
My goal is to have that the red block is on top of the blue block, the blue block is on top of the yellow block and the yellow block is on top of the orange block.

My plan is as follows:

NATURAL-PLAN sas_plan_9
------------------------------
This is the sequence of human-readable actions required to achieve the goal state, based directly on the provided PDDL plan.

The objects involved are the blocks: R, B, Y, and O.

1.  **Unstack Block B from Block O:** Lift B, which is currently resting on O.
2.  **Put Block B Down:** Place block B directly onto the table.
3.  **Pick Up Block R:** Lift block R from the table.
4.  **Stack Block R onto Block B:** Place the block R onto the top of block B.
5.  **Pick Up Block Y:** Lift block Y from the table.
6.  **Stack Block Y onto Block O:** Place the block Y onto the top of block O.
7.  **Unstack Block R from Block B:** Lift R, which is currently resting on B.
8.  **Put Block R Down:** Place block R directly onto the table.
9.  **Pick Up Block B:** Lift block B from the table.
10. **Stack Block B onto Block Y:** Place the block B onto the top of block Y. (Y is now on O, so this forms B-Y-O stack).
11. **Pick Up Block R:** Lift block R from the table.
12. **Stack Block R onto Block B:** Place the block R onto the top of block B.

***
*The goal state (R on B, B on Y, Y on O) is achieved.*

PROBLEM
------------------------------
I am playing with a set of blocks where I need to arrange the blocks into stacks. Here are the actions I can do

Pick up a block
Unstack a block from on top of another block
Put down a block
Stack a block on top of another block

I have the following restrictions on my actions:
I can only pick up or unstack one block at a time.
I can only pick up or unstack a block if my hand is empty.
I can only pick up a block if the block is on the table and the block is clear. A block is clear if the block has no other blocks on top of it and if the block is not picked up.
I can only unstack a block from on top of another block if the block I am unstacking was really on top of the other block.
I can only unstack a block from on top of another block if the block I am unstacking is clear.
Once I pick up or unstack a block, I am holding the block.
I can only put down a block that I am holding.
I can only stack a block on top of another block if I am holding the block being stacked.
I can only stack a block on top of another block if the block onto which I am stacking the block is clear.
Once I put down or stack a block, my hand becomes empty.
Once you stack a block on top of a second block, the second block is no longer clear.

[STATEMENT]
As initial conditions I have that, the orange block is clear, the yellow block is clear, the hand is empty, the orange block is on top of the blue block, the yellow block is on top of the red block, the red block is on the table and the blue block is on the table.
My goal is to have that the red block is on top of the yellow block and the blue block is on top of the orange block.

My plan is as follows:

I am playing with a set of blocks where I need to arrange the blocks into stacks. Here are the actions I can do

Pick up a block
Unstack a block from on top of another block
Put down a block
Stack a block on top of another block

I have the following restrictions on my actions:
I can only pick up or unstack one block at a time.
I can only pick up or unstack a block if my hand is empty.
I can only pick up a block if the block is on the table and the block is clear. A block is clear if the block has no other blocks on top of it and if the block is not picked up.
I can only unstack a block from on top of another block if the block I am unstacking was really on top of the other block.
I can only unstack a block from on top of another block if the block I am unstacking is clear.
Once I pick up or unstack a block, I am holding the block.
I can only put down a block that I am holding.
I can only stack a block on top of another block if I am holding the block being stacked.
I can only stack a block on top of another block if the block onto which I am stacking the block is clear.
Once I put down or stack a block, my hand becomes empty.
Once you stack a block on top of a second block, the second block is no longer clear.

[STATEMENT]
As initial conditions I have that, the orange block is clear, the yellow block is clear, the hand is empty, the orange block is on top of the blue block, the yellow block is on top of the red block, the red block is on the table and the blue block is on the table.
My goal is to have that the red block is on top of the yellow block and the blue block is on top of the orange block.

My plan is as follows:

PROBLEM
------------------------------
I am playing with a set of blocks where I need to arrange the blocks into stacks. Here are the actions I can do

Pick up a block
Unstack a block from on top of another block
Put down a block
Stack a block on top of another block

I have the following restrictions on my actions:
I can only pick up or unstack one block at a time.
I can only pick up or unstack a block if my hand is empty.
I can only pick up a block if the block is on the table and the block is clear. A block is clear if the block has no other blocks on top of it and if the block is not picked up.
I can only unstack a block from on top of another block if the block I am unstacking was really on top of the other block.
I can only unstack a block from on top of another block if the block I am unstacking is clear.
Once I pick up or unstack a block, I am holding the block.
I can only put down a block that I am holding.
I can only stack a block on top of another block if I am holding the block being stacked.
I can only stack a block on top of another block if the block onto which I am stacking the block is clear.
Once I put down or stack a block, my hand becomes empty.
Once you stack a block on top of a second block, the second block is no longer clear.

[STATEMENT]
As initial conditions I have that, the red block is clear, the blue block is clear, the hand is empty, the red block is on top of the yellow block, the yellow block is on top of the orange block, the blue block is on the table and the orange block is on the table.
My goal is to have that the blue block is on top of the orange block and the orange block is on top of the yellow block.

My plan is as follows:

PROBLEM
------------------------------
I am playing with a set of blocks where I need to arrange the blocks into stacks. Here are the actions I can do

Pick up a block
Unstack a block from on top of another block
Put down a block
Stack a block on top of another block

I have the following restrictions on my actions:
I can only pick up or unstack one block at a time.
I can only pick up or unstack a block if my hand is empty.
I can only pick up a block if the block is on the table and the block is clear. A block is clear if the block has no other blocks on top of it and if the block is not picked up.
I can only unstack a block from on top of another block if the block I am unstacking was really on top of the other block.
I can only unstack a block from on top of another block if the block I am unstacking is clear.
Once I pick up or unstack a block, I am holding the block.
I can only put down a block that I am holding.
I can only stack a block on top of another block if I am holding the block being stacked.
I can only stack a block on top of another block if the block onto which I am stacking the block is clear.
Once I put down or stack a block, my hand becomes empty.
Once you stack a block on top of a second block, the second block is no longer clear.

[STATEMENT]
As initial conditions I have that, the blue block is clear, the orange block is clear, the hand is empty, the red block is on top of the yellow block, the orange block is on top of the red block, the blue block is on the table and the yellow block is on the table.
My goal is to have that the red block is on top of the blue block, the orange block is on top of the red block and the yellow block is on top of the orange block.

My plan is as follows:

NATURAL-PLAN sas_plan_2
------------------------------
This is a sequence of 40 steps required to move 5 disks (A, B, C, D, E) from the Right peg to the Middle peg, following the strict rules of the Tower of Hanoi.

The initial configuration is:
*   **Right (R):** E (bottom), D, C, B, A (top)
*   **Middle (M):** Empty
*   **Left (L):** Empty

PROBLEM
------------------------------
I am playing with a set of blocks where I need to arrange the blocks into stacks. Here are the actions I can do

Pick up a block
Unstack a block from on top of another block
Put down a block
Stack a block on top of another block

I have the following restrictions on my actions:
I can only pick up or unstack one block at a time.
I can only pick up or unstack a block if my hand is empty.
I can only pick up a block if the block is on the table and the block is clear. A block is clear if the block has no other blocks on top of it and if the block is not picked up.
I can only unstack a block from on top of another block if the block I am unstacking was really on top of the other block.
I can only unstack a block from on top of another block if the block I am unstacking is clear.
Once I pick up or unstack a block, I am holding the block.
I can only put down a block that I am holding.
I can only stack a block on top of another block if I am holding the block being stacked.
I can only stack a block on top of another block if the block onto which I am stacking the block is clear.
Once I put down or stack a block, my hand becomes empty.
Once you stack a block on top of a second block, the second block is no longer clear.

[STATEMENT]
As initial conditions I have that, the blue block is clear, the orange block is clear, the hand is empty, the blue block is on top of the yellow block, the orange block is on top of the red block, the red block is on the table and the yellow block is on the table.
My goal is to have that the blue block is on top of the red block, the orange block is on top of the yellow block and the yellow block is on top of the blue block.

My plan is as follows:

PROBLEM
------------------------------
I am playing with a set of blocks where I need to arrange the blocks into stacks. Here are the actions I can do

Pick up a block
Unstack a block from on top of another block
Put down a block
Stack a block on top of another block

I have the following restrictions on my actions:
I can only pick up or unstack one block at a time.
I can only pick up or unstack a block if my hand is empty.
I can only pick up a block if the block is on the table and the block is clear. A block is clear if the block has no other blocks on top of it and if the block is not picked up.
I can only unstack a block from on top of another block if the block I am unstacking was really on top of the other block.
I can only unstack a block from on top of another block if the block I am unstacking is clear.
Once I pick up or unstack a block, I am holding the block.
I can only put down a block that I am holding.
I can only stack a block on top of another block if I am holding the block being stacked.
I can only stack a block on top of another block if the block onto which I am stacking the block is clear.
Once I put down or stack a block, my hand becomes empty.
Once you stack a block on top of a second block, the second block is no longer clear.

[STATEMENT]
As initial conditions I have that, the blue block is clear, the yellow block is clear, the hand is empty, the orange block is on top of the red block, the yellow block is on top of the orange block, the red block is on the table and the blue block is on the table.
My goal is to have that the blue block is on top of the orange block and the yellow block is on top of the red block.

My plan is as follows:

NATURAL-PLAN sas_plan_2
------------------------------
This is a plan to reconfigure a set of colored blocks on a table. The system must move the blocks one at a time to achieve the target configuration.

The sequence of actions is as follows:

1.  **Unstack Yellow from Orange.** (The agent takes Yellow, which was resting on Orange, and is now holding Yellow.)
2.  **Put down Yellow.** (The agent places Yellow onto the table.)
3.  **Unstack Orange from Red.** (The agent takes Orange, which was resting on Red, and is now holding Orange.)
4.  **Put down Orange.** (The agent places Orange onto the table.)
5.  **Pick up Blue.** (The agent picks up Blue from the table.)
6.  **Stack Blue onto Orange.** (The agent places the held block, Blue, on top of Orange.)
7.  **Pick up Yellow.** (The agent picks up Yellow from the table.)
8.  **Stack Yellow onto Red.** (The agent places the held block, Yellow, on top of Red.)

PROBLEM
------------------------------
I am playing with a set of blocks where I need to arrange the blocks into stacks. Here are the actions I can do

Pick up a block
Unstack a block from on top of another block
Put down a block
Stack a block on top of another block

I have the following restrictions on my actions:
I can only pick up or unstack one block at a time.
I can only pick up or unstack a block if my hand is empty.
I can only pick up a block if the block is on the table and the block is clear. A block is clear if the block has no other blocks on top of it and if the block is not picked up.
I can only unstack a block from on top of another block if the block I am unstacking was really on top of the other block.
I can only unstack a block from on top of another block if the block I am unstacking is clear.
Once I pick up or unstack a block, I am holding the block.
I can only put down a block that I am holding.
I can only stack a block on top of another block if I am holding the block being stacked.
I can only stack a block on top of another block if the block onto which I am stacking the block is clear.
Once I put down or stack a block, my hand becomes empty.
Once you stack a block on top of a second block, the second block is no longer clear.

[STATEMENT]
As initial conditions I have that, the red block is clear, the hand is empty, the red block is on top of the blue block, the blue block is on top of the yellow block, the yellow block is on top of the orange block and the orange block is on the table.
My goal is to have that the orange block is on top of the red block and the yellow block is on top of the blue block.

My plan is as follows:

NATURAL-PLAN sas_plan_1
------------------------------
This sequence of actions translates the PDDL plan into human-readable instructions to achieve the goal: Orange on Red, and Yellow on Blue.

**Initial State:** A stack exists where Red is on Blue, Blue is on Yellow, and Yellow is on Orange. Orange is on the table.

| Step | Action | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 1 | `(unstack r b)` | Unstack the **Red** block from the **Blue** block. (The agent is now holding Red.) |
| 2 | `(put-down r)` | Put down the **Red** block onto the table. |
| 3 | `(unstack b y)` | Unstack the **Blue** block from the **Yellow** block. (The agent is now holding Blue.) |
| 4 | `(put-down b)` | Put down the **Blue** block onto the table. |
| 5 | `(unstack y o)` | Unstack the **Yellow** block from the **Orange** block. (The agent is now holding Yellow.) |
| 6 | `(stack y b)` | Stack the **Yellow** block onto the **Blue** block. (Goal condition `(on y b)` achieved.) |
| 7 | `(pick-up o)` | Pick up the **Orange** block from the table. (The agent is now holding Orange.) |
| 8 | `(stack o r)` | Stack the **Orange** block onto the **Red** block. (Goal condition `(on o r)` achieved.) |

The final configuration satisfies the goal state: Orange is on Red, and Yellow is on Blue. (Total actions taken: 8)

PROBLEM
------------------------------
I am playing with a set of blocks where I need to arrange the blocks into stacks. Here are the actions I can do

Pick up a block
Unstack a block from on top of another block
Put down a block
Stack a block on top of another block

I have the following restrictions on my actions:
I can only pick up or unstack one block at a time.
I can only pick up or unstack a block if my hand is empty.
I can only pick up a block if the block is on the table and the block is clear. A block is clear if the block has no other blocks on top of it and if the block is not picked up.
I can only unstack a block from on top of another block if the block I am unstacking was really on top of the other block.
I can only unstack a block from on top of another block if the block I am unstacking is clear.
Once I pick up or unstack a block, I am holding the block.
I can only put down a block that I am holding.
I can only stack a block on top of another block if I am holding the block being stacked.
I can only stack a block on top of another block if the block onto which I am stacking the block is clear.
Once I put down or stack a block, my hand becomes empty.
Once you stack a block on top of a second block, the second block is no longer clear.

[STATEMENT]
As initial conditions I have that, the blue block is clear, the orange block is clear, the hand is empty, the blue block is on top of the yellow block, the orange block is on top of the red block, the red block is on the table and the yellow block is on the table.
My goal is to have that the red block is on top of the orange block and the yellow block is on top of the red block.

My plan is as follows:
