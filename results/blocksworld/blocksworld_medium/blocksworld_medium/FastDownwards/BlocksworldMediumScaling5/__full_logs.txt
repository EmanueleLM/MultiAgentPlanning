PROBLEM
------------------------------
I am playing with a set of blocks where I need to arrange the blocks into stacks. Here are the actions I can do

Pick up a block
Unstack a block from on top of another block
Put down a block
Stack a block on top of another block

I have the following restrictions on my actions:
I can only pick up or unstack one block at a time.
I can only pick up or unstack a block if my hand is empty.
I can only pick up a block if the block is on the table and the block is clear. A block is clear if the block has no other blocks on top of it and if the block is not picked up.
I can only unstack a block from on top of another block if the block I am unstacking was really on top of the other block.
I can only unstack a block from on top of another block if the block I am unstacking is clear.
Once I pick up or unstack a block, I am holding the block.
I can only put down a block that I am holding.
I can only stack a block on top of another block if I am holding the block being stacked.
I can only stack a block on top of another block if the block onto which I am stacking the block is clear.
Once I put down or stack a block, my hand becomes empty.
Once you stack a block on top of a second block, the second block is no longer clear.

[STATEMENT]
As initial conditions I have that, the red block is clear, the blue block is clear, the hand is empty, the red block is on top of the yellow block, the blue block is on top of the orange block, the orange block is on the table and the yellow block is on the table.
My goal is to have that the blue block is on top of the yellow block and the yellow block is on top of the red block.

My plan is as follows:

NATURAL-PLAN sas_plan_1
------------------------------
Based on the provided PDDL domain, problem, and plan, here is the sequence of human-readable instructions to achieve the goal state (Block B on Block Y, and Block Y on Block R).

The initial state is:
*   Block R is on Block Y.
*   Block B is on Block O.
*   Blocks Y and O are on the table.
*   The hand is empty.

**Goal:** Stack B onto Y, and Y onto R.

| Step | PDDL Action | Human Instruction |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 1 | `(unstack r y)` | **Unstack** Block R from Block Y. (Now holding R.) |
| 2 | `(put-down r)` | **Place** Block R down onto the table. (Hand is now empty.) |
| 3 | `(pick-up y)` | **Pick up** Block Y from the table. (Now holding Y.) |
| 4 | `(stack y r)` | **Stack** Block Y onto Block R. (Hand is now empty. R is no longer clear.) |
| 5 | `(unstack b o)` | **Unstack** Block B from Block O. (Now holding B. O is now clear.) |
| 6 | `(stack b y)` | **Stack** Block B onto Block Y. (Hand is now empty. Y is no longer clear.) |

**Plan Completed.**

PROBLEM
------------------------------
I am playing with a set of blocks where I need to arrange the blocks into stacks. Here are the actions I can do

Pick up a block
Unstack a block from on top of another block
Put down a block
Stack a block on top of another block

I have the following restrictions on my actions:
I can only pick up or unstack one block at a time.
I can only pick up or unstack a block if my hand is empty.
I can only pick up a block if the block is on the table and the block is clear. A block is clear if the block has no other blocks on top of it and if the block is not picked up.
I can only unstack a block from on top of another block if the block I am unstacking was really on top of the other block.
I can only unstack a block from on top of another block if the block I am unstacking is clear.
Once I pick up or unstack a block, I am holding the block.
I can only put down a block that I am holding.
I can only stack a block on top of another block if I am holding the block being stacked.
I can only stack a block on top of another block if the block onto which I am stacking the block is clear.
Once I put down or stack a block, my hand becomes empty.
Once you stack a block on top of a second block, the second block is no longer clear.

[STATEMENT]
As initial conditions I have that, the orange block is clear, the yellow block is clear, the hand is empty, the orange block is on top of the blue block, the yellow block is on top of the red block, the red block is on the table and the blue block is on the table.
My goal is to have that the red block is on top of the blue block.

My plan is as follows:

NATURAL-PLAN sas_plan_4
------------------------------
This is the sequence of human-readable instructions derived from the provided PDDL plan, starting from the initial configuration (Orange on Blue, Yellow on Red, both Blue and Red stacks on the Table) to achieve the goal state (Red on Blue).

| Step | Action | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 1 | **Unstack** | Unstack the **Orange** block from the **Blue** block. (Now holding Orange, Blue is clear.) |
| 2 | **Put Down** | Put the **Orange** block down onto the Table. (Orange is now on the Table and clear, hand is empty.) |
| 3 | **Unstack** | Unstack the **Yellow** block from the **Red** block. (Now holding Yellow, Red is clear.) |
| 4 | **Put Down** | Put the **Yellow** block down onto the Table. (Yellow is now on the Table and clear, hand is empty.) |
| 5 | **Pick Up** | Pick up the **Red** block from the Table. (Now holding Red.) |
| 6 | **Stack** | Stack the **Red** block onto the **Blue** block. (Goal achieved: Red is on Blue, hand is empty.) |

PROBLEM
------------------------------
I am playing with a set of blocks where I need to arrange the blocks into stacks. Here are the actions I can do

Pick up a block
Unstack a block from on top of another block
Put down a block
Stack a block on top of another block

I have the following restrictions on my actions:
I can only pick up or unstack one block at a time.
I can only pick up or unstack a block if my hand is empty.
I can only pick up a block if the block is on the table and the block is clear. A block is clear if the block has no other blocks on top of it and if the block is not picked up.
I can only unstack a block from on top of another block if the block I am unstacking was really on top of the other block.
I can only unstack a block from on top of another block if the block I am unstacking is clear.
Once I pick up or unstack a block, I am holding the block.
I can only put down a block that I am holding.
I can only stack a block on top of another block if I am holding the block being stacked.
I can only stack a block on top of another block if the block onto which I am stacking the block is clear.
Once I put down or stack a block, my hand becomes empty.
Once you stack a block on top of a second block, the second block is no longer clear.

[STATEMENT]
As initial conditions I have that, the red block is clear, the orange block is clear, the hand is empty, the blue block is on top of the yellow block, the orange block is on top of the blue block, the red block is on the table and the yellow block is on the table.
My goal is to have that the red block is on top of the orange block and the blue block is on top of the red block.

My plan is as follows:

NATURAL-PLAN sas_plan_1
------------------------------
This task requires rearranging the four blocks (Red, Orange, Blue, Yellow) from the initial configuration to achieve the goal state: Red (R) on Orange (O), and Blue (B) on Red (R).

The following sequence of 6 actions achieves the goal:

1.  **Unstack Orange (O) from Blue (B):** Pick up the Orange block (O), which is currently resting on Blue (B).
2.  **Put Down Orange (O):** Place the Orange block (O) onto the table.
3.  **Pick Up Red (R):** Pick up the Red block (R) from the table.
4.  **Stack Red (R) onto Orange (O):** Place the held Red block (R) onto the Orange block (O).
5.  **Unstack Blue (B) from Yellow (Y):** Pick up the Blue block (B), which is currently resting on Yellow (Y).
6.  **Stack Blue (B) onto Red (R):** Place the held Blue block (B) onto the Red block (R).

The goal state is now achieved: Blue is on Red, and Red is on Orange.

PROBLEM
------------------------------
I am playing with a set of blocks where I need to arrange the blocks into stacks. Here are the actions I can do

Pick up a block
Unstack a block from on top of another block
Put down a block
Stack a block on top of another block

I have the following restrictions on my actions:
I can only pick up or unstack one block at a time.
I can only pick up or unstack a block if my hand is empty.
I can only pick up a block if the block is on the table and the block is clear. A block is clear if the block has no other blocks on top of it and if the block is not picked up.
I can only unstack a block from on top of another block if the block I am unstacking was really on top of the other block.
I can only unstack a block from on top of another block if the block I am unstacking is clear.
Once I pick up or unstack a block, I am holding the block.
I can only put down a block that I am holding.
I can only stack a block on top of another block if I am holding the block being stacked.
I can only stack a block on top of another block if the block onto which I am stacking the block is clear.
Once I put down or stack a block, my hand becomes empty.
Once you stack a block on top of a second block, the second block is no longer clear.

[STATEMENT]
As initial conditions I have that, the red block is clear, the blue block is clear, the hand is empty, the red block is on top of the yellow block, the yellow block is on top of the orange block, the blue block is on the table and the orange block is on the table.
My goal is to have that the blue block is on top of the orange block and the yellow block is on top of the red block.

My plan is as follows:

PROBLEM
------------------------------
I am playing with a set of blocks where I need to arrange the blocks into stacks. Here are the actions I can do

Pick up a block
Unstack a block from on top of another block
Put down a block
Stack a block on top of another block

I have the following restrictions on my actions:
I can only pick up or unstack one block at a time.
I can only pick up or unstack a block if my hand is empty.
I can only pick up a block if the block is on the table and the block is clear. A block is clear if the block has no other blocks on top of it and if the block is not picked up.
I can only unstack a block from on top of another block if the block I am unstacking was really on top of the other block.
I can only unstack a block from on top of another block if the block I am unstacking is clear.
Once I pick up or unstack a block, I am holding the block.
I can only put down a block that I am holding.
I can only stack a block on top of another block if I am holding the block being stacked.
I can only stack a block on top of another block if the block onto which I am stacking the block is clear.
Once I put down or stack a block, my hand becomes empty.
Once you stack a block on top of a second block, the second block is no longer clear.

[STATEMENT]
As initial conditions I have that, the red block is clear, the orange block is clear, the hand is empty, the red block is on top of the yellow block, the orange block is on top of the blue block, the blue block is on the table and the yellow block is on the table.
My goal is to have that the red block is on top of the yellow block and the yellow block is on top of the orange block.

My plan is as follows:

NATURAL-PLAN sas_plan_1
------------------------------
This sequence of actions achieves the goal state (Red on Yellow, Yellow on Orange) starting from the initial configuration (Red on Yellow, Orange on Blue, with Yellow and Blue on the table).

**Initial State:**
*   Stack 1: Red (top, clear) on Yellow (bottom, on table).
*   Stack 2: Orange (top, clear) on Blue (bottom, on table).
*   Hand is empty.

| Step | Action | Description | Resulting State Changes |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **1** | UNSTACK (R, Y) | Unstack the **Red** block from the **Yellow** block. | The hand is now holding Red. Yellow is now clear. |
| **2** | PUT-DOWN (R) | Put down the **Red** block onto the table. | The hand is now empty. Red is on the table and clear. |
| **3** | PICK-UP (Y) | Pick up the **Yellow** block from the table. | The hand is now holding Yellow. |
| **4** | STACK (Y, O) | Stack the **Yellow** block onto the **Orange** block. | The hand is now empty. Yellow is on Orange. Orange is no longer clear. |
| **5** | PICK-UP (R) | Pick up the **Red** block from the table. | The hand is now holding Red. |
| **6** | STACK (R, Y) | Stack the **Red** block onto the **Yellow** block. | The hand is now empty. Red is on Yellow. Yellow is no longer clear. **Goal Achieved.** |

**Final Configuration:** Red is on Yellow, and Yellow is on Orange. (The Blue block remains under Orange).

PROBLEM
------------------------------
I am playing with a set of blocks where I need to arrange the blocks into stacks. Here are the actions I can do

Pick up a block
Unstack a block from on top of another block
Put down a block
Stack a block on top of another block

I have the following restrictions on my actions:
I can only pick up or unstack one block at a time.
I can only pick up or unstack a block if my hand is empty.
I can only pick up a block if the block is on the table and the block is clear. A block is clear if the block has no other blocks on top of it and if the block is not picked up.
I can only unstack a block from on top of another block if the block I am unstacking was really on top of the other block.
I can only unstack a block from on top of another block if the block I am unstacking is clear.
Once I pick up or unstack a block, I am holding the block.
I can only put down a block that I am holding.
I can only stack a block on top of another block if I am holding the block being stacked.
I can only stack a block on top of another block if the block onto which I am stacking the block is clear.
Once I put down or stack a block, my hand becomes empty.
Once you stack a block on top of a second block, the second block is no longer clear.

[STATEMENT]
As initial conditions I have that, the orange block is clear, the hand is empty, the red block is on top of the yellow block, the orange block is on top of the red block, the yellow block is on top of the blue block and the blue block is on the table.
My goal is to have that the yellow block is on top of the orange block.

My plan is as follows:

NATURAL-PLAN sas_plan_1
------------------------------
This plan details the steps required to reconfigure the blocks from the initial state (Blue, Yellow, Red, Orange stack) to achieve the goal state (Yellow on Orange).

### Action Plan

| Step | Action | Description |
| :---: | :--- | :--- |
| 1 | **Unstack (Orange, Red)** | Pick up the Orange block from on top of the Red block. |
| 2 | **Put Down (Orange)** | Place the Orange block onto the Table. |
| 3 | **Unstack (Red, Yellow)** | Pick up the Red block from on top of the Yellow block. |
| 4 | **Put Down (Red)** | Place the Red block onto the Table. |
| 5 | **Unstack (Yellow, Blue)** | Pick up the Yellow block from on top of the Blue block. |
| 6 | **Stack (Yellow, Orange)** | Place the Yellow block onto the top of the Orange block. |

The goal state is now achieved: The Yellow block is on the Orange block.
