PROBLEM
------------------------------
I am playing with a set of blocks where I need to arrange the blocks into stacks. Here are the actions I can do

Pick up a block
Unstack a block from on top of another block
Put down a block
Stack a block on top of another block

I have the following restrictions on my actions:
I can only pick up or unstack one block at a time.
I can only pick up or unstack a block if my hand is empty.
I can only pick up a block if the block is on the table and the block is clear. A block is clear if the block has no other blocks on top of it and if the block is not picked up.
I can only unstack a block from on top of another block if the block I am unstacking was really on top of the other block.
I can only unstack a block from on top of another block if the block I am unstacking is clear.
Once I pick up or unstack a block, I am holding the block.
I can only put down a block that I am holding.
I can only stack a block on top of another block if I am holding the block being stacked.
I can only stack a block on top of another block if the block onto which I am stacking the block is clear.
Once I put down or stack a block, my hand becomes empty.
Once you stack a block on top of a second block, the second block is no longer clear.

[STATEMENT]
As initial conditions I have that, the red block is clear, the blue block is clear, the hand is empty, the blue block is on top of the yellow block, the yellow block is on top of the orange block, the red block is on the table and the orange block is on the table.
My goal is to have that the blue block is on top of the red block and the orange block is on top of the blue block.

My plan is as follows:

NATURAL-PLAN sas_plan_1
------------------------------
This plan details the steps required to achieve the target configuration in the blocksworld environment.

**Goal:** Achieve the stack configuration (Orange on Blue on Red) from the initial configuration (Blue on Yellow on Orange, and Red on Table).

| Step | Action | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 1 | `(unstack blue yellow)` | Unstack Block BLUE from the top of Block YELLOW. (Hand now holds BLUE.) |
| 2 | `(stack blue red)` | Stack Block BLUE onto Block RED. (RED is now the base of a new stack.) |
| 3 | `(unstack yellow orange)` | Unstack Block YELLOW from the top of Block ORANGE. (Hand now holds YELLOW.) |
| 4 | `(put-down yellow)` | Put down Block YELLOW onto the table. |
| 5 | `(pick-up orange)` | Pick up Block ORANGE from the table. (ORANGE was the base of the original stack.) |
| 6 | `(stack orange blue)` | Stack Block ORANGE onto Block BLUE. (The final goal stack [Orange, Blue, Red] is complete.) |

PROBLEM
------------------------------
I am playing with a set of blocks where I need to arrange the blocks into stacks. Here are the actions I can do

Pick up a block
Unstack a block from on top of another block
Put down a block
Stack a block on top of another block

I have the following restrictions on my actions:
I can only pick up or unstack one block at a time.
I can only pick up or unstack a block if my hand is empty.
I can only pick up a block if the block is on the table and the block is clear. A block is clear if the block has no other blocks on top of it and if the block is not picked up.
I can only unstack a block from on top of another block if the block I am unstacking was really on top of the other block.
I can only unstack a block from on top of another block if the block I am unstacking is clear.
Once I pick up or unstack a block, I am holding the block.
I can only put down a block that I am holding.
I can only stack a block on top of another block if I am holding the block being stacked.
I can only stack a block on top of another block if the block onto which I am stacking the block is clear.
Once I put down or stack a block, my hand becomes empty.
Once you stack a block on top of a second block, the second block is no longer clear.

[STATEMENT]
As initial conditions I have that, the blue block is clear, the orange block is clear, the yellow block is clear, the hand is empty, the blue block is on top of the red block, the red block is on the table, the orange block is on the table and the yellow block is on the table.
My goal is to have that the red block is on top of the blue block, the blue block is on top of the orange block and the yellow block is on top of the red block.

My plan is as follows:

NATURAL-PLAN sas_plan_2
------------------------------
This plan outlines the steps required to rearrange the blocks from the initial configuration (Blue on Red, Orange and Yellow on the table) to the target configuration (Yellow on Red, Red on Blue, Blue on Orange).

| Step | Action | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 1 | `(unstack blue red)` | **Unstack** the block named 'blue' from the block named 'red'. (Now holding 'blue'). |
| 2 | `(stack blue orange)` | **Stack** the block 'blue' (currently held) onto the block named 'orange'. |
| 3 | `(pick-up red)` | **Pick up** the block named 'red' from the table. (Now holding 'red'). |
| 4 | `(stack red blue)` | **Stack** the block 'red' (currently held) onto the block named 'blue'. |
| 5 | `(pick-up yellow)` | **Pick up** the block named 'yellow' from the table. (Now holding 'yellow'). |
| 6 | `(stack yellow red)` | **Stack** the block 'yellow' (currently held) onto the block named 'red'. |
