Summary of executed actions (timestamps and short descriptions). Each step matches the provided plan exactly.

Start time: 00:00:00
Step duration used for reporting: 10s per action (timestamps approximate).

1) 00:00:00 — (unstack f e)
   - Action: Unstack block f from block e (pick up f from the top of e).
   - Effect: holding(f); e becomes clear.

2) 00:00:10 — (putdown f)
   - Action: Put down block f onto the table.
   - Effect: ontable(f); f is clear; hand empty.

3) 00:00:20 — (unstack d a)
   - Action: Unstack block d from block a (pick up d from the top of a).
   - Effect: holding(d); a becomes clear.

4) 00:00:30 — (stack d e)
   - Action: Stack block d onto block e (place d on top of e).
   - Effect: on(d e); d becomes clear; e is no longer clear.

5) 00:00:40 — (unstack a g)
   - Action: Unstack block a from block g (pick up a from the top of g).
   - Effect: holding(a); g becomes clear.

6) 00:00:50 — (stack a f)
   - Action: Stack block a onto block f (place a on top of f which is on the table).
   - Effect: on(a f); a becomes clear; f is no longer clear.

7) 00:01:00 — (unstack d e)
   - Action: Unstack block d from block e (pick up d from the top of e).
   - Effect: holding(d); e becomes clear.

8) 00:01:10 — (putdown d)
   - Action: Put down block d onto the table.
   - Effect: ontable(d); d is clear; hand empty.

9) 00:01:20 — (pickup e)
   - Action: Pick up block e from the table.
   - Effect: holding(e); e is no longer on the table.

10) 00:01:30 — (stack e a)
    - Action: Stack block e onto block a (place e on top of a, which is on f).
    - Effect: on(e a); e becomes clear; a is no longer clear.

11) 00:01:40 — (pickup d)
    - Action: Pick up block d from the table.
    - Effect: holding(d); d is no longer on the table.

12) 00:01:50 — (stack d e)
    - Action: Stack block d onto block e (place d on top of e, which is on a on f).
    - Effect: on(d e); d becomes clear; e is no longer clear; hand empty.

Final arrangement (explicit mapping):
- f is on the table.
- a is on f.
- e is on a.
- d is on e.
- g is on c.
- c is on h.
- h is on b.
- b is on the table.

This sequence exactly follows the provided plan and achieves the final goal configuration. Total plan cost (unit cost): 12.
