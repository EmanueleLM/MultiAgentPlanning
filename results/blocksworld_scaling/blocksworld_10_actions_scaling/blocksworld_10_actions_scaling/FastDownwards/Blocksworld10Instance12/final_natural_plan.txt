Plan executed by agent2 (four actions). Timestamps and durations are relative, 1s per action:

1) Time 0s — Action: unstack-agent2 F from G
   - Agent: agent2
   - What happened: agent2 removed block F from on top of block G and picked up F.
   - Immediate effects (observable): F is no longer on G; agent2 is holding F; G becomes clear (nothing on G); agent2's hand is no longer empty.
   - Duration: ~1s

2) Time 1s — Action: stack-agent2 F onto B
   - Agent: agent2
   - What happened: agent2 placed the carried block F onto block B.
   - Immediate effects (observable): F is now on B; F is clear (nothing on F); B is no longer clear (F is on it); agent2's hand becomes empty (agent2 is no longer holding F).
   - Duration: ~1s

3) Time 2s — Action: unstack-agent2 G from E
   - Agent: agent2
   - What happened: agent2 removed block G from on top of block E and picked up G.
   - Immediate effects (observable): G is no longer on E; agent2 is holding G; E becomes clear; agent2's hand is not empty while holding G.
   - Duration: ~1s

4) Time 3s — Action: putdown-agent2 G (put G on the table)
   - Agent: agent2
   - What happened: agent2 put the carried block G down onto the table.
   - Immediate effects (observable): G is on the table and is clear; agent2's hand becomes empty (no longer holding G).
   - Duration: ~1s

Final (observable) block arrangement after these actions:
- C on A
- A on H
- H on the table
- B on the table
- F on B
- D on the table
- E on D
- G on the table

This sequence matches the provided plan exactly (unstack F G; stack F B; unstack G E; putdown G).
