Summary timeline (timestamps assume 1 second per action, starting t=00:00:00). I list for each step: plan action name, human-readable action, preconditions checked, feasibility, and the resulting world state (on / ontable relations and relevant clear/holding/handempty facts).

Initial state (t = 00:00:00, before any action)
- Relations:
  - on A B
  - on B C
  - on C F
  - on F D
  - ontable D
  - ontable E
- Clear: A, E
- Hand status: handempty
- (Stacks visual): [A on B on C on F on D(table)] and [E(table)]
- No ambiguities.

Step 1 (t = 00:00:00 → 00:00:01)
- Plan action: (pickup-e-step1)
- Human action: pickup(E) — pick E from the table into a hand.
- Preconditions checked: E is ontable (true), E is clear (true), handempty (true).
- Feasible: yes.
- Effects / resulting state:
  - holding E
  - E is no longer on the table
  - handempty = false
  - Other relations unchanged:
    - on A B
    - on B C
    - on C F
    - on F D
    - ontable D
  - Clear: A remains clear; E is in hand (treated as held).
  - (Stacks): [A on B on C on F on D(table)]; E in hand.

Step 2 (t = 00:00:01 → 00:00:02)
- Plan action: (stack-e-on-a-step2)
- Human action: stack(E, A) — place E on top of A.
- Preconditions checked: holding E (true), clear A (true).
- Feasible: yes.
- Effects / resulting state:
  - on E A
  - holding E = false
  - handempty = true
  - clear A = false (because E is now on it)
  - clear E = true (E is top)
  - Other relations unchanged:
    - on B C
    - on C F
    - on F D
    - ontable D
  - (Stacks): [E on A on B on C on F on D(table)]

Step 3 (t = 00:00:02 → 00:00:03)
- Plan action: (unstack-e-from-a-step3)
- Human action: unstack(E, A) — pick E up from A.
- Preconditions checked: on E A (true), clear E (true), handempty (true).
- Feasible: yes.
- Effects / resulting state:
  - holding E
  - E is no longer on A
  - clear A = true (A now top of its stack)
  - handempty = false
  - Remaining stack after removal:
    - on A B
    - on B C
    - on C F
    - on F D
    - ontable D
  - E is in hand.

Step 4 (t = 00:00:03 → 00:00:04)
- Plan action: (putdown-e-step4)
- Human action: putdown(E) — put E down on the table.
- Preconditions checked: holding E (true).
- Feasible: yes.
- Effects / resulting state:
  - ontable E
  - clear E = true
  - handempty = true
  - E no longer held
  - Stack for A returned to: A on B on C on F on D(table)
  - Other relations:
    - on B C
    - on C F
    - on F D
    - ontable D

Step 5 (t = 00:00:04 → 00:00:05)
- Plan action: (unstack-a-from-b-step5)
- Human action: unstack(A, B) — pick A up from B.
- Preconditions checked: on A B (true), clear A (true), handempty (true).
- Feasible: yes.
- Effects / resulting state:
  - holding A
  - A is no longer on B
  - clear B = true
  - handempty = false
  - Remaining stack becomes: B on C on F on D(table)
  - E remains ontable
  - C/F/D relations unchanged

Step 6 (t = 00:00:05 → 00:00:06)
- Plan action: (putdown-a-step6)
- Human action: putdown(A) — put A down on the table.
- Preconditions checked: holding A (true).
- Feasible: yes.
- Effects / resulting state:
  - ontable A
  - clear A = true
  - handempty = true
  - B on C on F on D(table) remains
  - E ontable

Current state after Step 6 (t = 00:00:06)
- Relations:
  - on B C
  - on C F
  - on F D
  - ontable D
  - ontable A
  - ontable E
- Clear: A, B, E
- Hand status: handempty
- (Stacks): [B on C on F on D(table)]; [A(table)]; [E(table)]

Step 7 (t = 00:00:06 → 00:00:07)
- Plan action: (pickup-e-step7)
- Human action: pickup(E) — pick E from the table again.
- Preconditions checked: E ontable (true), clear E (true), handempty (true).
- Feasible: yes.
- Effects / resulting state:
  - holding E
  - E removed from table
  - handempty = false
  - Other relations unchanged

Step 8 (t = 00:00:07 → 00:00:08)
- Plan action: (putdown-e-step8)
- Human action: putdown(E) — put E down on the table.
- Preconditions checked: holding E (true).
- Feasible: yes.
- Effects / resulting state:
  - ontable E
  - clear E = true
  - handempty = true
  - State returns to same as after Step 6

Step 9 (t = 00:00:08 → 00:00:09)
- Plan action: (pickup-e-step9)
- Human action: pickup(E) — pick E from the table again (third pick).
- Preconditions checked: E ontable (true), clear E (true), handempty (true).
- Feasible: yes.
- Effects / resulting state:
  - holding E
  - E not ontable
  - handempty = false

Step 10 (t = 00:00:09 → 00:00:10)
- Plan action: (putdown-e-step10)
- Human action: putdown(E) — put E down on the table (final putdown).
- Preconditions checked: holding E (true).
- Feasible: yes.
- Effects / resulting (final) state:
  - ontable E
  - clear E = true
  - handempty = true
  - Final block placements:
    - on B C
    - on C F
    - on F D
    - ontable D
    - ontable A
    - ontable E
  - Final clear predicates: A, B, E are clear; C, F, D are not clear (they have blocks on them).
  - No blocks are being held.

Final remark
- The full executed sequence matches the provided plan exactly (10 actions). All preconditions were satisfied at each step; there were no ambiguities in the public information. The final arrangement after step10 is:
  - A — on the table
  - B — on C
  - C — on F
  - F — on D
  - D — on the table
  - E — on the table
- Timeline ended at t = 00:00:10 (10 actions × 1s each).
