Summary of executed plan (matching the provided PDDL plan exactly)

Initial relevant state (before step 1)
- Stacks: F on A on C on B (B on table). E on D on G (G on table).
- Clear blocks: F, E
- Robot: hand empty

Step 1
- Time: 00:00:00 → 00:00:01 (duration 1.0 s)
- Action (as in plan): unstack(E, D)
- Executing agent: agent1 (assigned odd-numbered actions)
- Preconditions checked: E is on D, E is clear, robot hand is empty — action is legal.
- Immediate state change:
  - E removed from on(D): (not (on E D))
  - Robot now holding E: (holding E)
  - D becomes clear: (clear D)
  - E is no longer clear while being held
  - Robot is no longer handempty
- Observation: Action is effective (not redundant); E is now in the robot’s gripper.

Step 2
- Time: 00:00:01 → 00:00:02 (duration 1.0 s)
- Action (as in plan): stack(E, F)
- Executing agent: agent2 (assigned even-numbered actions)
- Preconditions checked: robot is holding E, F is clear — action is legal.
- Immediate state change:
  - E placed on F: (on E F)
  - Robot releases E (not holding E)
  - F is no longer clear
  - E becomes clear (now top of its stack)
  - Robot becomes handempty
- Observation: Action is effective; final placement matches plan goal.

Final arrangement (after step 2)
- On relationships:
  - on E F
  - on F A
  - on A C
  - on C B
  - on D G
- Ontable:
  - ontable B
  - ontable G
- Clear blocks:
  - clear E
  - clear D
- Robot: handempty

This final state corresponds exactly to the PDDL goal encoded in the problem:
- (on e f), (on f a), (on a c), (on c b), (ontable b), (on d g), (ontable g)

No extra actions were performed; both actions in the plan were executed in order and were necessary/legal given the initial state.
