Sequence of actions (matches the given plan exactly). Timestamps are illustrative (start at 00:00:00, each action duration = 5s). I also indicate which robot performs each action according to the specification.

1) step1-unstack-f-b — robot_alpha
   - Action: unstack(F, B)
   - Human description: robot_alpha picks up block F from on top of block B (now holding F).
   - Start: 00:00:00 — Duration: 5s — End: 00:00:05

2) step2-stack-f-d — robot_alpha
   - Action: stack(F, D)
   - Human description: robot_alpha places block F onto block D (F now on D, hand empty).
   - Start: 00:00:05 — Duration: 5s — End: 00:00:10

3) step3-unstack-b-c — robot_beta
   - Action: unstack(B, C)
   - Human description: robot_beta picks up block B from on top of block C (now holding B).
   - Start: 00:00:10 — Duration: 5s — End: 00:00:15

4) step4-stack-b-f — robot_beta
   - Action: stack(B, F)
   - Human description: robot_beta places block B onto block F (B now on F, hand empty).
   - Start: 00:00:15 — Duration: 5s — End: 00:00:20

5) step5-unstack-b-f — robot_alpha
   - Action: unstack(B, F)
   - Human description: robot_alpha picks up block B from on top of block F (now holding B).
   - Start: 00:00:20 — Duration: 5s — End: 00:00:25

6) step6-stack-b-c — robot_alpha
   - Action: stack(B, C)
   - Human description: robot_alpha places block B onto block C (B now on C, hand empty).
   - Start: 00:00:25 — Duration: 5s — End: 00:00:30

7) step7-unstack-f-d — robot_beta
   - Action: unstack(F, D)
   - Human description: robot_beta picks up block F from on top of block D (now holding F).
   - Start: 00:00:30 — Duration: 5s — End: 00:00:35

8) step8-putdown-f — robot_alpha
   - Action: putdown(F)
   - Human description: robot_alpha puts block F down onto the table (F on table, hand empty).
   - Start: 00:00:35 — Duration: 5s — End: 00:00:40

9) step9-unstack-d-e — robot_beta
   - Action: unstack(D, E)
   - Human description: robot_beta picks up block D from on top of block E (now holding D).
   - Start: 00:00:40 — Duration: 5s — End: 00:00:45

10) step10-stack-d-f — robot_beta
    - Action: stack(D, F)
    - Human description: robot_beta places block D onto block F (D now on F, final hand empty).
    - Start: 00:00:45 — Duration: 5s — End: 00:00:50

Final status (after step10)
- Robot hands: handempty (no robot is holding a block).
- Current plan step: curr s10 (execution completed).
- Final block arrangement (top -> bottom stacks, and table placements):
  - Stack: D on F on the table. (on D F; ontable F)
  - Stack: B on C on the table. (on B C; ontable C)
  - Stack: E on A on the table. (on E A; ontable A)

This sequence exactly follows the given plan and satisfies the final goal (curr s10 and handempty) and yields the final block arrangement above.
