Summary of execution (timestamps approximate, each action duration 10s). Agent manipulator1 executed all actions; manipulator2 remained idle but handempty throughout.

Initial arrangement (before step1)
- Table stacks (top listed last): [A], with B on A, H on B, E on H → stack: A <- B <- H <- E (E is top)
- [G], with F on G, C on F → stack: G <- F <- C (C is top)
- [D] on the table (D is alone and clear)
- Hand status: manipulator1 and manipulator2 are handempty.

Actions (follow the provided plan exactly)

1) Step 1 — 00:00:00 to 00:00:10 (duration 10s)
- Action: pickup(D) — manipulator1
- Pre-state (local): D is on the table and clear; manipulator1 handempty.
- Operation: manipulator1 picks up block D from the table.
- Post-state (local): manipulator1 is holding D; D is no longer on the table and is not clear while held.
- Observations: Table stack [D] becomes empty; manipulator1 now holding D.

2) Step 2 — 00:00:10 to 00:00:20 (duration 10s)
- Action: putdown(D) — manipulator1
- Pre-state: manipulator1 holding D.
- Operation: manipulator1 puts D down onto the table.
- Post-state: D is on the table and clear; manipulator1 is handempty.
- Observations: D returned to its original single-block table position.

3) Step 3 — 00:00:20 to 00:00:30 (duration 10s)
- Action: pickup(D) — manipulator1
- Pre-state: D on the table and clear; manipulator1 handempty.
- Operation: manipulator1 picks up D again from the table.
- Post-state: manipulator1 holding D; D removed from the table.
- Observations: D is again being held by manipulator1.

4) Step 4 — 00:00:30 to 00:00:40 (duration 10s)
- Action: stack(D, E) — manipulator1
- Pre-state: manipulator1 holding D; E is the top of the stack A <- B <- H <- E and E is clear.
- Operation: manipulator1 places D on top of E.
- Post-state: D is on E; D is clear; E is no longer clear; manipulator1 is handempty.
- Observations: The stack A <- B <- H <- E becomes A <- B <- H <- E <- D (D is new top of that stack).

5) Step 5 — 00:00:40 to 00:00:50 (duration 10s)
- Action: unstack(C, F) — manipulator1
- Pre-state: C is on F and C is clear; manipulator1 handempty.
- Operation: manipulator1 un-stacks (picks up) C from F.
- Post-state: manipulator1 is holding C; F becomes clear; C is no longer on F and not clear while held.
- Observations: The stack G <- F <- C becomes G <- F (C removed and held by manipulator1).

6) Step 6 — 00:00:50 to 00:01:00 (duration 10s)
- Action: stack(C, D) — manipulator1
- Pre-state: manipulator1 holding C; D is on E and is clear (from step 4).
- Operation: manipulator1 places C on top of D.
- Post-state: C is on D; C becomes clear; D is no longer clear; manipulator1 is handempty.
- Observations: The stack A <- B <- H <- E <- D becomes A <- B <- H <- E <- D <- C (C now on D).

7) Step 7 — 00:01:00 to 00:01:10 (duration 10s)
- Action: unstack(C, D) — manipulator1
- Pre-state: C is on D and C is clear; manipulator1 handempty.
- Operation: manipulator1 un-stacks (picks up) C from D.
- Post-state: manipulator1 is holding C; D becomes clear; C removed from D and not clear while held.
- Observations: The stack A <- B <- H <- E <- D <- C becomes A <- B <- H <- E <- D (D is now top of that stack).

8) Step 8 — 00:01:10 to 00:01:20 (duration 10s)
- Action: stack(C, F) — manipulator1
- Pre-state: manipulator1 holding C; F is clear (from step 5).
- Operation: manipulator1 places C on top of F.
- Post-state: C is on F; C is clear; F is no longer clear; manipulator1 is handempty.
- Observations: The stack G <- F becomes G <- F <- C (C returned to its earlier position on F).

9) Step 9 — 00:01:20 to 00:01:30 (duration 10s)
- Action: unstack(C, F) — manipulator1
- Pre-state: C is on F and C is clear; manipulator1 handempty.
- Operation: manipulator1 un-stacks (picks up) C from F again.
- Post-state: manipulator1 holding C; F becomes clear; C not on F while held.
- Observations: The stack G <- F <- C becomes G <- F; C in hand.

10) Step 10 — 00:01:30 to 00:01:40 (duration 10s)
- Action: putdown(C) — manipulator1
- Pre-state: manipulator1 holding C.
- Operation: manipulator1 puts C down onto the table.
- Post-state: C is on the table and clear; manipulator1 is handempty.
- Observations: C is now on the table as a separate stack.

Final state (after step10)
- Stacks:
  - A is on the table; B on A; H on B; E on H; D on E → stack: A <- B <- H <- E <- D (D is top of this stack)
  - G is on the table; F on G → stack: G <- F (F is top)
  - C is on the table (single-block stack)
- Predicates (human-readable):
  - on b a
  - on h b
  - on e h
  - on d e
  - on f g
  - ontable a
  - ontable g
  - ontable c
- Hand status:
  - manipulator1: handempty
  - manipulator2: handempty

Goal achieved:
- at-step s10 (sequence completed)
- manipulator1 handempty
- manipulator2 handempty

Notes:
- All actions and their order match the provided plan exactly; no actions were added or removed.
- Timestamps and durations are illustrative to indicate sequencing and were included where possible as requested.
