1) 2025-10-21T09:00:00Z — robot_alpha — unstack(E, B) — duration 00:00:05  
   - Action: robot_alpha lifts block E off block B (only the top block E is picked).  
   - Immediate result: robot_alpha is holding E; B becomes clear.  
   - Configuration after action: (holding E); stack: B on C on A on F; D on table.

2) 2025-10-21T09:00:05Z — robot_alpha — putdown(E) — duration 00:00:03  
   - Action: robot_alpha puts block E down onto the table.  
   - Immediate result: E is on the table and clear; hand is empty.  
   - Configuration after action: E on table; stack: B on C on A on F; D on table.

3) 2025-10-21T09:00:08Z — robot_beta — pickup(D) — duration 00:00:04  
   - Action: robot_beta picks up block D from the table.  
   - Immediate result: robot_beta is holding D; D is no longer on the table.  
   - Configuration after action: (holding D); E on table; stack: B on C on A on F.

4) 2025-10-21T09:00:12Z — robot_beta — stack(D, B) — duration 00:00:06  
   - Action: robot_beta places block D on top of block B.  
   - Immediate result: D is on B; hand is empty; B is no longer clear.  
   - Final configuration: D on B, B on C, C on A, A on F, F on the table, E on the table.

Final check (goal):  
- on D B — true  
- on B C — true  
- on C A — true  
- on A F — true  
- ontable F — true  
- ontable E — true

(The above sequence follows exactly the plan: unstack E from B; putdown E; pickup D; stack D on B.)
