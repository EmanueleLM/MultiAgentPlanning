Summary of initial configuration (before step 1):
- Stack 1 (left): E on A on B (B on table)
- Stack 2 (center): D on C (C on table)
- Stack 3 (right): F on G (G on table)

Action sequence (each action executed by mover1; each action duration = 1 unit, start times shown):
1) Time 0s (duration 1s) — unstack(E, A)
   - mover1 picks E up from on top of A.
   - Result: E is held; A becomes clear.

2) Time 1s (duration 1s) — stack(E, D)
   - mover1 places E on top of D.
   - Result: E on D; D is no longer clear; mover1’s hand is empty.

3) Time 2s (duration 1s) — unstack(E, D)
   - mover1 picks E up from D.
   - Result: E is held; D becomes clear.

4) Time 3s (duration 1s) — stack(E, F)
   - mover1 places E on top of F.
   - Result: E on F on G; mover1’s hand is empty.

5) Time 4s (duration 1s) — unstack(D, C)
   - mover1 picks D up from C.
   - Result: D is held; C becomes clear.

6) Time 5s (duration 1s) — putdown(D)
   - mover1 puts D down on the table.
   - Result: D on table; D is clear; mover1’s hand is empty.

7) Time 6s (duration 1s) — unstack(E, F)
   - mover1 picks E up from F.
   - Result: E is held; F becomes clear (F still on G).

8) Time 7s (duration 1s) — stack(E, F)
   - mover1 places E back on F.
   - Result: E on F on G; mover1’s hand is empty.

9) Time 8s (duration 1s) — unstack(E, F)  (pick E off F again)
   - mover1 picks E up from F.
   - Result: E is held; F becomes clear.

10) Time 9s (duration 1s) — putdown(E)
    - mover1 puts E down on the table.
    - Result: E on table; E is clear; mover1’s hand is empty.

Final arrangement after all steps:
- on(A, B)   (A is on B)
- on(F, G)   (F is on G)
- on-table: B, C, D, E, G

Equivalently as stacks:
- Stack 1 (left): A on B (B on table)
- Middle: C on table and D on table (separate single-block stacks)
- Stack 3 (right): F on G (G on table)
- E is on the table (alone)

This sequence matches the given plan exactly (10 actions, unit cost each) and yields the final block arrangement above.
