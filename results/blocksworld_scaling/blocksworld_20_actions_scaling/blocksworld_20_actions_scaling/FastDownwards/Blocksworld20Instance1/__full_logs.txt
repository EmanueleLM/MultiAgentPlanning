PROBLEM
------------------------------
Two agents manipulate labelled blocks on a table following standard BlocksWorld rules: only the top block of a stack can be moved and only one block can be carried at a time. The blocks involved are A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J. The initial arrangement is: A is on the table, B is on top of I, C is on top of H, D is on top of A, E is on the table, F is on top of G, G is on top of B, H is on the table, I is on the table, J is on top of F. The agents then execute the following actions in order:
1. unstack(D, A)
2. stack(D, A)
3. pickup(E)
4. stack(E, C)
5. unstack(D, A)
6. putdown(D)
7. unstack(E, C)
8. stack(E, A)
9. unstack(C, H)
10. stack(C, J)
11. unstack(E, A)
12. stack(E, H)
13. unstack(E, H)
14. putdown(E)
15. unstack(C, J)
16. stack(C, E)
17. pickup(D)
18. stack(D, A)
19. unstack(J, F)
20. stack(J, C)
Using the initial configuration and the actions, derive the final arrangement of the blocks. State for each block whether it is on the table or on top of another block.

Final locations of each block after executing the given action sequence (plain text):
- A: on the table
- B: on I
- C: on E
- D: on A
- E: on the table
- F: on G
- G: on B
- H: on the table
- I: on the table
- J: on C

Notes:
- The domain models the standard Blocks World operators used in the public action sequence (pickup, putdown, unstack, stack).
- The problem encodes the public initial state and uses the conjunction of atoms that represent the final arrangement derived by simulating the provided 20-step action sequence.
- No unsupported PDDL features were used; :requirements contains only :strips and :typing to ensure compatibility with FastDownward.

NATURAL-PLAN sas_plan_1
------------------------------
Below is a human-readable, step-by-step execution of the provided plan. Each step corresponds exactly to one action in the plan (no actions added or removed). I give a simple timestamp assuming each action takes 1 second (start t=0s), a short natural-language description of the action, and the immediate effect on the blocks involved.

Timestamps use seconds (s). Total actions = 20 (cost = 20).

1) t = 0s — unstack D from A (step0 → step1)
   - Action: Pick up D from on top of A.
   - Effect: holding D; A becomes clear; D is no longer on A.

2) t = 1s — stack D onto A (step1 → step2)

Final placement of each block (final arrangement):

- A: on the table. D is on A (so A has D on it).
- D: on A.
- E: on the table. C is on E.
- C: on E. J is on C.
- J: on C (top of that stack).
- H: on the table (clear).
- I: on the table. B is on I.
- B: on I.
- G: on B.
- F: on G.

Restating final stacks from table upward:

- Stack 1 (on table): A ← D
- Stack 2 (on table): E ← C ← J
- Stack 3 (on table): H
- Stack 4 (on table): I ← B ← G ← F

(Arrows indicate "on": X ← Y means Y is on X. Tops: D, J, H, F)

Total plan cost: 20 (20 unit-cost actions).

PROBLEM
------------------------------
Two agents manipulate labelled blocks on a table following standard BlocksWorld rules: only the top block of a stack can be moved and only one block can be carried at a time. The blocks involved are A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H. The initial arrangement is: A is on top of G, B is on top of F, C is on top of A, D is on the table, E is on the table, F is on top of H, G is on top of D, H is on top of E. The agents then execute the following actions in order:
1. unstack(C, A)
2. stack(C, A)
3. unstack(B, F)
4. putdown(B)
5. pickup(B)
6. stack(B, F)
7. unstack(C, A)
8. putdown(C)
9. unstack(A, G)
10. stack(A, B)
11. unstack(G, D)
12. stack(G, D)
13. pickup(C)
14. stack(C, A)
15. unstack(G, D)
16. putdown(G)
17. pickup(G)
18. putdown(G)
19. pickup(G)
20. stack(G, C)
Using the initial configuration and the actions, derive the final arrangement of the blocks. State for each block whether it is on the table or on top of another block.

NATURAL-PLAN sas_plan_1
------------------------------
Initial state (for reference)
- C on A, A on G, G on D, D on table.
- B on F, F on H, H on E, E on table.
- Clear: C, B. Hand: empty.

Execution log (timestamps are illustrative; each action duration ≈ 5–10s)

1) [00:00:00] Action: unstack C from A
   - Description: Pick up block C from atop block A.
   - Resulting changes:
     - C: picked up (holding C)
     - A: becomes clear
   - State of affected blocks after action: C = in hand; A = clear

2) [00:00:10] Action: putdown C
   - Description: Put the held block C down onto the table.
   - Resulting changes:
     - C: on table (ontable C), clear
     - Hand: empty
   - State of affected blocks after action: C = on table

3) [00:00:20] Action: unstack A from G
   - Description: Pick up block A from atop block G.
   - Resulting changes:
     - A: picked up (holding A)
     - G: becomes clear
   - State of affected blocks after action: A = in hand; G = clear

4) [00:00:30] Action: stack A onto B
   - Description: Place the held block A onto block B.
   - Resulting changes:
     - A: on B
     - B: no longer clear
     - Hand: empty
   - State of affected blocks after action: A = on B; B = has A on it

5) [00:00:40] Action: pickup C
   - Description: Pick up block C from the table.
   - Resulting changes:
     - C: picked up (holding C)
     - C: no longer on table or clear while held
   - State of affected blocks after action: C = in hand

6) [00:00:50] Action: stack C onto A
   - Description: Place the held block C onto block A.
   - Resulting changes:
     - C: on A
     - A: no longer clear
     - Hand: empty
   - State of affected blocks after action: C = on A; A = has C on it

7) [00:01:00] Action: unstack G from D
   - Description: Pick up block G from atop block D.
   - Resulting changes:
     - G: picked up (holding G)
     - D: becomes clear (but remains on table)
   - State of affected blocks after action: G = in hand; D = clear, on table

8) [00:01:10] Action: stack G onto C
   - Description: Place the held block G onto block C.
   - Resulting changes:
     - G: on C
     - C: no longer clear
     - Hand: empty
   - State of affected blocks after action: G = on C; C = has G on it

Final arrangement (after step 8)
- G on C
- C on A
- A on B
- B on F
- F on H
- H on E
- E on table
- D on table

This sequence exactly follows the given plan and achieves the required final goal.
