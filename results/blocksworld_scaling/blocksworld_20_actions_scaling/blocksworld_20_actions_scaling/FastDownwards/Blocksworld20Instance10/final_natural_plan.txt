   - agent1’s hand is empty.

7) step6 -> step7 — agent1 unstack J from I.
   - agent1 picks up J; J is now held by agent1.
   - I becomes clear.

8) step7 -> step8 — agent1 stack J onto I.
   - agent1 places J back on top of I.

9) step8 -> step9 — agent2 unstack B from F.
   - agent2 picks up B; B is now held by agent2.
   - F becomes clear.

10) step9 -> step10 — agent2 stack B onto J.
    - agent2 places B on top of J.
    - B is on J; B is clear; J is not clear.
    - agent2’s hand is empty.

11) step10 -> step11 — agent2 unstack B from J.
    - agent2 picks up B; B is now held by agent2.
    - J becomes clear.

12) step11 -> step12 — agent2 putdown B (place B on the table).
    - agent2 puts B down on the table.
    - B is on the table and clear.
    - agent2’s hand is empty.

13) step12 -> step13 — agent2 unstack J from I.

    - G becomes clear.

16) step15 -> step16 — agent2 stack F onto J.
    - agent2 places F on top of J (J is on the table).
    - F is on J; F is clear; J is not clear.
    - agent2’s hand is empty.

17) step16 -> step17 — agent2 unstack F from J.
    - agent2 picks up F; F is now held by agent2.

    - agent2 places I on top of G.
    - I is on G; I is clear; G is not clear.
    - agent2’s hand is empty.

Final placement summary (after step20):
- A: on the table (A has E on it).
- B: on the table (B has F on it).
- C: on D (C is clear).
- D: on H (D has C on it).
- E: on A (E has G on it).
- F: on B (F is clear).
- G: on E (G has I on it).
- H: on the table (H has D on it).
- I: on G (I is clear).
- J: on the table (J is clear).

All actions above correspond exactly, in order and agent assignment, to the provided plan (20 scheduled steps, each taking the transition stepN -> stepN+1).
