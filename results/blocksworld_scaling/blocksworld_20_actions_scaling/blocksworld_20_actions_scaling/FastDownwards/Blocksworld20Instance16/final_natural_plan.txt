1) unstack(C, F)
   - time: 0.0s → 1.0s (duration 1.0s)
   - preconditions checked (at time 0.0s): on(C, F) = true (C is top of stack B-J-F-C), clear(C) = true, handempty = true.
   - effect: remove C from F and hold it. After this step: holding(C) = true, clear(F) = true, on(C, F) = false, handempty = false.

2) stack(C, E)
   - time: 1.0s → 2.0s (duration 1.0s)
   - preconditions checked (at time 1.0s): holding(C) = true, clear(E) = true (E was top of D-I-E).
   - effect: place C onto E. After this step: on(C, E) = true, clear(C) = true, clear(E) = false, holding(C) = false, handempty = true.

Resulting final arrangement (bottom → top):
 - Stack1: G - H - A
 - Stack2: B - J - F
 - Stack3: D - I - E - C

Total plan cost: 2 (unit-cost steps). All actions were legal when executed and the final state matches the specified goal.
