Summary: I follow the given plan exactly (10 actions, unit cost each). I report a timestamped step trace, check legality of each action against standard Blocks World rules (only the top block can be moved; one block in hand at a time), and show the resulting world state after each step. Each action is assumed to take 1 time unit (plan cost = 10). Initial time t = 0.

Initial state (t = 0)
- Stacks (top → bottom; table is the bottom):
  - Stack 1: D → A → B → E (E on table)
  - Stack 2: C (on table)
  - Stack 3: G → F (F on table)
- Clear blocks (tops): D, C, G
- Hand: empty

Step 1 (t = 1, duration = 1)
- Action: pickup(C)
- Preconditions checked: ontable(C) = true, clear(C) = true, handempty = true → Legal.
- Effects applied: C removed from table and is now held.
- Resulting state:
  - Stack 1: D → A → B → E
  - Stack 2: (empty at former C position)
  - Stack 3: G → F
  - Holding: C
  - Clear blocks: D, G (C is not clear while held)
  - Hand: not empty

Step 2 (t = 2, duration = 1)
- Action: stack(C, G)
- Preconditions checked: holding(C) = true, clear(G) = true → Legal.
- Effects applied: C placed on top of G; hand becomes empty.
- Resulting state:
  - Stack 1: D → A → B → E
  - Stack 2: (empty)
  - Stack 3: C → G → F
  - Holding: none
  - Clear blocks: D, C (C is now top), G is not clear
  - Hand: empty

Step 3 (t = 3, duration = 1)
- Action: unstack(D, A)
- Preconditions checked: on(D, A) = true, clear(D) = true, handempty = true → Legal.
- Effects applied: D removed from A and is now held; A becomes clear.
- Resulting state:
  - Stack 1: A → B → E
  - Stack 2: (empty)
  - Stack 3: C → G → F
  - Holding: D
  - Clear blocks: A, C
  - Hand: not empty

Step 4 (t = 4, duration = 1)
- Action: stack(D, C)
- Preconditions checked: holding(D) = true, clear(C) = true → Legal.
- Effects applied: D placed on top of C; hand becomes empty.
- Resulting state:
  - Stack 1: A → B → E
  - Stack 2: (empty)
  - Stack 3: D → C → G → F
  - Holding: none
  - Clear blocks: A, D (D is now top)
  - Hand: empty

Step 5 (t = 5, duration = 1)
- Action: unstack(A, B)
- Preconditions checked: on(A, B) = true, clear(A) = true, handempty = true → Legal.
- Effects applied: A removed from B and is now held; B becomes clear.
- Resulting state:
  - Stack 1: B → E
  - Stack 2: (empty)
  - Stack 3: D → C → G → F
  - Holding: A
  - Clear blocks: B, D
  - Hand: not empty

Step 6 (t = 6, duration = 1)
- Action: putdown(A)
- Preconditions checked: holding(A) = true → Legal.
- Effects applied: A put down on the table as its own stack; hand becomes empty.
- Resulting state:
  - Stack 1: B → E
  - Stack 2: A (on table)
  - Stack 3: D → C → G → F
  - Holding: none
  - Clear blocks: A, B, D
  - Hand: empty

Step 7 (t = 7, duration = 1)
- Action: unstack(B, E)
- Preconditions checked: on(B, E) = true, clear(B) = true, handempty = true → Legal.
- Effects applied: B removed from E and is now held; E becomes clear.
- Resulting state:
  - Stack 1: E
  - Stack 2: A
  - Stack 3: D → C → G → F
  - Holding: B
  - Clear blocks: E, A, D
  - Hand: not empty

Step 8 (t = 8, duration = 1)
- Action: putdown(B)
- Preconditions checked: holding(B) = true → Legal.
- Effects applied: B put down on the table as its own stack; hand becomes empty.
- Resulting state:
  - Stack 1: E (on table)
  - Stack 2: A (on table)
  - Stack 3: B (on table)
  - Stack 4: D → C → G → F
  - Holding: none
  - Clear blocks: E, A, B, D
  - Hand: empty

Step 9 (t = 9, duration = 1)
- Action: pickup(A)
- Preconditions checked: ontable(A) = true, clear(A) = true, handempty = true → Legal.
- Effects applied: A picked up from the table.
- Resulting state:
  - Stack 1: E
  - Stack 2: (A removed)
  - Stack 3: B
  - Stack 4: D → C → G → F
  - Holding: A
  - Clear blocks: E, B, D
  - Hand: not empty

Step 10 (t = 10, duration = 1)
- Action: stack(A, B)
- Preconditions checked: holding(A) = true, clear(B) = true → Legal.
- Effects applied: A placed on top of B; hand becomes empty.
- Resulting (final) state:
  - Stack 1: E (on table)
  - Stack 2: B → A (B on table, A on B)
  - Stack 3: D → C → G → F
  - Holding: none
  - Clear blocks: E, A, D
  - Hand: empty

Final arrangement (t = 10)
- Explicit listing by block:
  - A is on B
  - B is on the table
  - C is on G
  - D is on C
  - E is on the table
  - F is on the table
  - G is on F

Goal check
- The final arrangement matches the specified goal:
  - on A B: yes
  - ontable B: yes
  - on C G: yes
  - on D C: yes
  - ontable E: yes
  - ontable F: yes
  - on G F: yes

Notes and assumptions
- Each action used here matches exactly the actions in the provided plan; no actions were added or removed.
- Each action was legal under standard Blocks World rules at the moment it was executed; I explicitly verified required preconditions (topness/clearness, ontable or on relation, handempty, or holding).
- Time: each action is treated as taking 1 time unit; timestamps are given as t = 1..10. Total cost = 10 (unit cost per action), consistent with the plan.
