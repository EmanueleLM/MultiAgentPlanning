Summary: Execute the given plan exactly (10 actions). I split execution reporting between agents: agent_alpha executes steps 1–5, agent_beta executes steps 6–10. Each step shows an approximate timestamp (start), an estimated duration, the precondition observed, and the immediate postcondition effects on the predicates: on, ontable, clear, holding, handempty.

Timestamps use a simple offset starting at 00:00:00, duration ≈5s per action.

1) [00:00:00, dur ~5s] agent_alpha — unstack(a, d)
- Precondition observed: on(a,d), clear(a), handempty.
- Postcondition effects:
  - holding(a) becomes true.
  - on(a,d) is removed.
  - clear(d) becomes true.
  - clear(a) becomes false (since a is held).
  - handempty becomes false.

2) [00:00:05, dur ~5s] agent_alpha — stack(a, g)
- Precondition observed: holding(a), clear(g).
- Postcondition effects:
  - on(a,g) becomes true.
  - holding(a) becomes false.
  - clear(a) becomes true (a has nothing on it).
  - clear(g) becomes false (a is on g).
  - handempty becomes true.

3) [00:00:10, dur ~5s] agent_alpha — unstack(b, f)
- Precondition observed: on(b,f), clear(b), handempty.
- Postcondition effects:
  - holding(b) becomes true.
  - on(b,f) is removed.
  - clear(f) becomes true.
  - clear(b) becomes false.
  - handempty becomes false.

4) [00:00:15, dur ~5s] agent_alpha — putdown(b)
- Precondition observed: holding(b).
- Postcondition effects:
  - ontable(b) becomes true (b placed on the table).
  - holding(b) becomes false.
  - clear(b) becomes true.
  - handempty becomes true.

5) [00:00:20, dur ~5s] agent_alpha — unstack(a, g)
- Precondition observed: on(a,g), clear(a), handempty.
- Postcondition effects:
  - holding(a) becomes true.
  - on(a,g) is removed.
  - clear(g) becomes true.
  - clear(a) becomes false.
  - handempty becomes false.

6) [00:00:25, dur ~5s] agent_beta — putdown(a)
- Precondition observed: holding(a).
- Postcondition effects:
  - ontable(a) becomes true (a placed on the table).
  - holding(a) becomes false.
  - clear(a) becomes true.
  - handempty becomes true.

7) [00:00:30, dur ~5s] agent_beta — pickup(g)
- Precondition observed: ontable(g), clear(g), handempty.
- Postcondition effects:
  - holding(g) becomes true.
  - ontable(g) is removed.
  - clear(g) becomes false (while held).
  - handempty becomes false.

8) [00:00:35, dur ~5s] agent_beta — stack(g, f)
- Precondition observed: holding(g), clear(f).
- Postcondition effects:
  - on(g,f) becomes true.
  - holding(g) becomes false.
  - clear(g) becomes true.
  - clear(f) becomes false.
  - handempty becomes true.

9) [00:00:40, dur ~5s] agent_beta — pickup(a)
- Precondition observed: ontable(a), clear(a), handempty.
- Postcondition effects:
  - holding(a) becomes true.
  - ontable(a) is removed.
  - clear(a) becomes false.
  - handempty becomes false.

10) [00:00:45, dur ~5s] agent_beta — stack(a, g)
- Precondition observed: holding(a), clear(g).
- Postcondition effects:
  - on(a,g) becomes true.
  - holding(a) becomes false.
  - clear(a) becomes true.
  - clear(g) becomes false.
  - handempty becomes true.

Final state (after step 10), relevant facts (matches the goal):
- on(a,g)
- on(g,f)
- on(f,i)
- on(i,h)
- on(d,e)
- on(e,c)
- ontable(c)
- ontable(h)
- ontable(b)
- handempty

Cost: 10 actions (unit cost per action).
