Execution trace (actions follow the provided plan exactly). Timestamps are illustrative and equally spaced (1s per action).

1) t=00:00:00 — manipulator1 performs: unstack(F, D)
   - Action: manipulator1 unhooks block F from on top of block D and picks up F.
   - Preconditions satisfied: on(F, D); F was clear; manipulator1 was handempty.
   - Immediate effects: manipulator1 is holding F; F is no longer on D; D becomes clear; manipulator1 is no longer handempty.

2) t=00:00:01 — manipulator2 performs: pickup(D)
   - Action: manipulator2 picks up block D from the table.
   - Preconditions satisfied after step 1: D is on the table and is now clear; manipulator2 was handempty.
   - Immediate effects: manipulator2 is holding D; D is no longer on the table; manipulator2 is no longer handempty.

3) t=00:00:02 — manipulator2 performs: stack(D, F)
   - Action: manipulator2 places block D onto block F (stacks D on F).
   - Preconditions satisfied: manipulator2 was holding D; F was clear (F is currently being held by manipulator1 but is clear as required by the domain).
   - Immediate effects: on(D, F) becomes true; D becomes clear; F becomes not clear; manipulator2 becomes handempty; manipulator2 no longer holds D.

4) t=00:00:03 — manipulator1 performs: putdown(F)
   - Action: manipulator1 puts block F down onto the table.
   - Preconditions satisfied: manipulator1 was holding F.
   - Immediate effects: F becomes on the table (ontable(F)); F becomes clear (per the putdown effect); manipulator1 becomes handempty; manipulator1 no longer holds F.

Final block arrangement (as required by the goal):
- on(A, G)
- on(G, C)
- on(C, B)
- on(B, E)
- ontable(E)
- on(D, F)
- ontable(F)

Notes:
- The above steps match the given plan exactly and produce the final relations listed in the goal.
