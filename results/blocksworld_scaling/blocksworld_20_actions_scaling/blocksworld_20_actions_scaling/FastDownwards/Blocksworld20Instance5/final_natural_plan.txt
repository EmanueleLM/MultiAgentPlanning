Sequence of executed actions (timestamps approximate, 1s per action). All actions executed by agent1.

1) t=0s — Step 1: unstack(H, D) — agent1
   - Preconditions observed: H is on D and H is clear.
   - Action: agent1 un-stacks H from D and holds H.
   - Immediate effect: agent1 is holding H; D becomes clear.
   - Local stacks after step: Stack2 becomes [D, G, F] (D on G, G on F, F on table). H is held.

   - Preconditions: agent1 holding H, C is clear.
   - Action: agent1 places H onto C.
   - Immediate effect: H is on C; agent1's hand is empty; C is no longer clear; H becomes clear (top).
   - Local stacks after step: Stack1 becomes [H, C, E, A, B] (H on C on E on A on B, B on table).

3) t=2s — Step 3: unstack(H, C) — agent1
   - Preconditions: H is on C and H is clear.
   - Action: agent1 un-stacks H from C and holds H.
   - Immediate effect: C becomes clear; agent1 holding H.
   - Local stacks after step: Stack1 becomes [C, E, A, B]; H is held.

4) t=3s — Step 4: putdown(H) — agent1
   - Preconditions: agent1 holding H.
   - Action: agent1 puts H down onto the table.
   - Immediate effect: H is on the table (clear); agent1's hand empty.
   - Local stacks after step: New table stack [H]. Other stacks: [C, E, A, B] and [D, G, F].

   - Local stacks after step: Stack1 becomes [E, A, B]; C is held.

10) t=9s — Step 10: putdown(C) — agent1
    - Preconditions: agent1 holding C.
    - Action: agent1 puts C down onto the table.
    - Immediate effect: C on table (clear); agent1 hand empty.

Final arrangement of all blocks (state: either "on table" or "on X"):

- A is on B.
- B is on the table.
- C is on the table.
- D is on G.
- E is on A.
- F is on the table.
- G is on F.
- H is on E.

(Top elements / clear blocks at the end: H (top of [H,E,A,B]), D (top of [D,G,F]), and C (on table) are clear.)
