9. Step 9 — t=00:00:08 (duration ≈ 1s) — orchestrator: pick up H from the table.
   - Action: Orchestrator picks H up from the table (H was cleared in step 7).
   - State change: H is held by orchestrator; H is no longer on the table.

10. Step 10 — t=00:00:09 (duration ≈ 1s) — orchestrator: stack H onto D.
    - Action: Orchestrator places H on top of block D.

11. Step 11 — t=00:00:10 (duration ≈ 1s) — orchestrator: unstack H from D.
    - Action: Orchestrator picks H up from the top of D.
    - State change: H is held by orchestrator; D becomes clear.

12. Step 12 — t=00:00:11 (duration ≈ 1s) — orchestrator: stack H onto D.
    - Action: Orchestrator places H back onto D.
    - State change: H is on D again; D is not clear; orchestrator’s hand becomes empty; H is clear.

13. Step 13 — t=00:00:12 (duration ≈ 1s) — orchestrator: unstack E from F.
    - Action: Orchestrator picks up E from the top of F.
    - State change: E is held by orchestrator; F becomes clear.

14. Step 14 — t=00:00:13 (duration ≈ 1s) — orchestrator: put down E on the table.
    - Action: Orchestrator places E on the table.
    - State change: E is on the table and clear; orchestrator’s hand becomes empty.

15. Step 15 — t=00:00:14 (duration ≈ 1s) — orchestrator: unstack H from D.
    - Action: Orchestrator picks H up from the top of D.
    - State change: H is held by orchestrator; D becomes clear.

16. Step 16 — t=00:00:15 (duration ≈ 1s) — orchestrator: put down H on the table.
    - Action: Orchestrator places H on the table.
    - State change: H is on the table and clear; orchestrator’s hand becomes empty.

17. Step 17 — t=00:00:16 (duration ≈ 1s) — robot1: pick up H from the table.
    - Action: Robot1 picks H up from the table.
    - State change: H is held by robot1; H is no longer on the table.

18. Step 18 — t=00:00:17 (duration ≈ 1s) — robot1: stack H onto E.
    - Action: Robot1 places H on top of block E (which is on the table).
    - State change: H is on E; E is no longer clear; robot1’s hand becomes empty; H is clear.

19. Step 19 — t=00:00:18 (duration ≈ 1s) — orchestrator: unstack D from A.

Final arrangement achieved (after Step 20):
- A is on C.
- C is on G.
- G is on the table.
- B is on the table.
- F is on B.
- E is on the table.
- H is on E.
- D is on H.
