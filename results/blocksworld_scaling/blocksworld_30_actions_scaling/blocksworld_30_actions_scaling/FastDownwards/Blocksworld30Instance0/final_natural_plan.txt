Summary: the following 12 actions are executed in the given order. Each step lists a timestamp (start), the action (mapped exactly from the plan), and the immediate observable effects on block positions / hold status. Times are illustrative (10 s per action).

Step 1 — 00:00
Action: unstack H from G
Effect/observation: H is picked up (holding H). G becomes clear. H is no longer on G.

Step 2 — 00:10
Action: stack H on B
Effect/observation: H is placed on B (on H B). H becomes clear. Hand is empty. B is no longer clear (H on top).

Step 3 — 00:20
Action: unstack F from D
Effect/observation: F is picked up (holding F). D becomes clear. F is no longer on D.

Step 4 — 00:30
Action: stack F on G
Effect/observation: F is placed on G (on F G). F becomes clear. Hand is empty. G is no longer clear.

Step 5 — 00:40
Action: unstack D from A
Effect/observation: D is picked up (holding D). A becomes clear. D is no longer on A.

Step 6 — 00:50
Action: putdown D
Effect/observation: D is placed on the table (ontable D). D becomes clear. Hand is empty.

Step 7 — 01:00
Action: unstack F from G
Effect/observation: F is picked up (holding F). G becomes clear. F is no longer on G.

Step 8 — 01:10
Action: putdown F
Effect/observation: F is placed on the table (ontable F). F becomes clear. Hand is empty.

Step 9 — 01:20
Action: pickup G
Effect/observation: G is picked up (holding G). G is no longer on C (if it was), and the block that was under G becomes clear (C becomes clear if G was on C prior to pickup).

Step 10 — 01:30
Action: stack G on C
Effect/observation: G is placed on C (on G C). G becomes clear. Hand is empty. C is no longer clear.

Step 11 — 01:40
Action: pickup F
Effect/observation: F is picked up (holding F). F is no longer on the table. The table position under F is now free (F lifted).

Step 12 — 01:50
Action: stack F on G
Effect/observation: F is placed on G (on F G). F becomes clear. Hand is empty. G is no longer clear.

Final arrangement (derived from the above actions):
- A: on the table (ontable A)
- B: on the table with H on top (ontable B; on H B)
- C: on top of E (on C E)
- D: on the table (ontable D)
- E: on the table (ontable E)
- F: on G (on F G)
- G: on C (on G C)
- H: on B (on H B)

Total actions executed: 12 (cost = 12, unit cost per action).
