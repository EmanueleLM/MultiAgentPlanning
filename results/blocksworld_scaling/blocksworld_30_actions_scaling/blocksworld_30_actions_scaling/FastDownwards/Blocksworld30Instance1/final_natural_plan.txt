Summary / Observations
- All 30 planned actions were executed in order, alternating agents as assigned (agent1 = odd steps, agent2 = even steps).
- Every action's preconditions were satisfied at the time of execution; there were no illegal attempts.
- The enforced step sequencing was respected (the plan reaches at-step s30).

Final block arrangement after step 30 (top → below / or on-table):
- E on B (on E B)
- D on H (on D H)
- A on G (on A G)
- C on table
- B on table (with E on top)
- F on table
- H on table (with D on top)
- G on table

(Equivalently: stacks include — stack1: E on B on table; stack2: D on H on table; stack3: A on G on table; plus C and F on table.)
