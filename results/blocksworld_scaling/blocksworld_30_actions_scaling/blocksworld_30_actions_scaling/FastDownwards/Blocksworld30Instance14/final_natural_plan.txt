Initial state (t=0s):
- Stacks on the table, bottom→top:
  1. [D, H, A, E]
  2. [F, G, B]
  3. [C]
- Agents: agent1 and agent2 are free-handed.

Action sequence (timestamps shown as seconds elapsed from start; each action ≈ 1s):

1) t=1s — agent1: unstack B from G
   - Action: agent1 removes top block B from on top of G and holds B.
   - Local change (affected stack): stack [F, G, B] → [F, G] (G becomes clear). B is in agent1's hand.

2) t=2s — agent1: putdown B
   - Action: agent1 places B onto the table (creates a new table stack).
   - Local change: B becomes its own table stack [B], clear. agent1 is handempty.

3) t=3s — agent1: unstack E from A
   - Action: agent1 removes top block E from on top of A and holds E.
   - Local change (affected stack): [D, H, A, E] → [D, H, A] (A becomes clear). E is in agent1's hand.

4) t=4s — agent1: putdown E
   - Action: agent1 places E onto the table (new table stack).
   - Local change: E becomes its own table stack [E], clear. agent1 is handempty.

5) t=5s — agent1: unstack A from H
   - Action: agent1 removes A from on top of H and holds A.
   - Local change (affected stack): [D, H, A] → [D, H] (H becomes clear). A is in agent1's hand.

6) t=6s — agent1: putdown A
   - Action: agent1 places A onto the table (new table stack).
   - Local change: A becomes its own table stack [A], clear. agent1 is handempty.

7) t=7s — agent1: unstack G from F
   - Action: agent1 removes G from on top of F and holds G.
   - Local change (affected stack): [F, G] → [F] (F becomes clear). G is in agent1's hand.

8) t=8s — agent1: stack G on A
   - Action: agent1 places G (held) onto A (which is clear).
   - Local change: stack [A] → [A, G] (G is now on A, G clear; A no longer clear). agent1 is handempty.

9) t=9s — agent2: pickup C
   - Action: agent2 picks up C from the table.
   - Local change (affected stack): [C] → removed (C held by agent2). agent2 is not handempty.

10) t=10s — agent2: stack C on F
    - Action: agent2 places C (held) onto F (which is clear).
    - Local change: stack [F] → [F, C] (C on F, C clear). agent2 is handempty.

11) t=11s — agent1: unstack H from D
    - Action: agent1 removes H from on top of D and holds H.
    - Local change (affected stack): [D, H] → [D] (D becomes clear). H is in agent1's hand.

12) t=12s — agent1: stack H on B
    - Action: agent1 places H (held) onto B (which is clear on the table).
    - Local change: stack [B] → [B, H] (H on B, H clear; B no longer clear). agent1 is handempty.

13) t=13s — agent2: pickup D
    - Action: agent2 picks up D from the table.
    - Local change (affected stack): [D] → removed (D held by agent2). agent2 is not handempty.

14) t=14s — agent2: stack D on H
    - Action: agent2 places D (held) onto H (which is clear on top of B).
    - Local change: stack [B, H] → [B, H, D] (D on H, D clear). agent2 is handempty.

15) t=15s — verify (no movement)
    - Action: terminal verification action confirming final arrangement.
    - Confirmed final arrangement:
      - A is on the table with G on A  → stack [A, G]
      - B is on the table with H on B and D on H → stack [B, H, D]
      - C is on F → stack [F, C]
      - E is on the table → stack [E]
      - F is on the table (base of [F, C]) → table
    - Both agents are handempty at verification time.

Notes:
- The sequence above exactly follows the provided plan; no actions were added or removed.
- Timestamps are approximate and shown for clarity (each action ~1s).
