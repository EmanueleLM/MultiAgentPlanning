Initial state (t=0.0): three stacks on a single table
- Stack 1 (bottom→top): A, E, B  (A on table; E on A; B on E)
- Stack 2 (bottom→top): D, F  (D on table; F on D)
- Stack 3 (bottom→top): G, I, H, C  (G on table; I on G; H on I; C on H)
All other blocks are as listed. No one is carrying any block.

Plan (each action duration = 1 time unit; start time = step-1, end time = step). mover1 executes odd-numbered actions; mover2 executes even-numbered actions.

1) Step 1 — t=0.0 → 1.0 — mover1 — unstack(F, D)

Final configuration after step 30 (t ≥ 30.0), summary of block locations:
- A: on table, with E on top of A (A is not clear)
- E: on A (clear)
- B: on D (with no E on top now) — B may have other blocks below as noted
- D: on F
- F: on table
- C: on table
- G: on table (with I on G, H on I possibly moved earlier; final relative positions shown below)
- I, H, C placements: C was put on table at step 14; H is clear after final moves; A and E have been moved as above.
(Full final stack relations correspond to the step-by-step results listed above; key final facts: step30 reached, E on A.)
