Step 1 — t=0.0 → t=1.0 (duration 1.0)
Action: (unstack h g)

Human-readable: Put down H onto the table — place H on the table.  
Precondition satisfied: agent was holding H.  
Effect: H is on the table and clear; agent's hand is empty.

Step 3 — t=2.0 → t=3.0 (duration 1.0)
Action: (unstack g j)

Precondition satisfied: G was clear after H was removed and the hand was empty.  
Effect: agent is holding G; J becomes clear.

Step 4 — t=3.0 → t=4.0 (duration 1.0)
