PROBLEM
------------------------------
Two agents manipulate labelled blocks on a table following standard BlocksWorld rules: only the top block of a stack can be moved and only one block can be carried at a time. The blocks involved are A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, L. The initial arrangement is: A is on the table, B is on top of K, C is on top of A, D is on top of C, E is on the table, F is on top of G, G is on top of L, H is on the table, I is on the table, J is on top of E, K is on top of I, L is on top of J. The agents then execute the following actions in order:
1. unstack(B, K)
2. putdown(B)
3. pickup(H)
4. stack(H, B)
5. unstack(H, B)
6. putdown(H)
7. unstack(K, I)
8. stack(K, B)
9. unstack(F, G)
10. stack(F, D)
11. unstack(K, B)
12. stack(K, B)
13. pickup(I)
14. stack(I, H)
15. unstack(G, L)
16. stack(G, L)
17. unstack(F, D)
18. stack(F, K)
19. unstack(G, L)
20. stack(G, D)
21. unstack(G, D)
22. putdown(G)
23. unstack(F, K)
24. putdown(F)
25. unstack(D, C)
26. stack(D, C)
27. pickup(G)
28. putdown(G)
29. unstack(D, C)
30. stack(D, C)
31. unstack(D, C)
32. putdown(D)
33. unstack(C, A)
34. stack(C, G)
35. unstack(L, J)
36. putdown(L)
37. unstack(J, E)
38. stack(J, L)
39. pickup(F)
40. stack(F, D)
Using the initial configuration and the actions, derive the final arrangement of the blocks. State for each block whether it is on the table or on top of another block.
