Plan (14 steps, each step duration 1.0s, sequential):

1) t = 0.0s – 1.0s (dur 1.0s): unstack F from H
   - Action: Unstack(F, H) — pick up block F that was on top of block H (now holding F).

2) t = 1.0s – 2.0s (dur 1.0s): stack F onto G
   - Action: Stack(F, G) — place held block F onto block G (now F on G, hand empty).

3) t = 2.0s – 3.0s (dur 1.0s): unstack A from C
   - Action: Unstack(A, C) — pick up block A that was on top of block C (now holding A).

4) t = 3.0s – 4.0s (dur 1.0s): stack A onto H
   - Action: Stack(A, H) — place held block A onto block H (now A on H, hand empty).

5) t = 4.0s – 5.0s (dur 1.0s): unstack D from E
   - Action: Unstack(D, E) — pick up block D that was on top of block E (now holding D).

6) t = 5.0s – 6.0s (dur 1.0s): putdown D
   - Action: Putdown(D) — put held block D down onto the table (now D on table, hand empty).

7) t = 6.0s – 7.0s (dur 1.0s): pickup C
   - Action: Pickup(C) — pick up block C from the table (now holding C).

8) t = 7.0s – 8.0s (dur 1.0s): stack C onto F
   - Action: Stack(C, F) — place held block C onto block F (now C on F, hand empty).

9) t = 8.0s – 9.0s (dur 1.0s): unstack A from H
   - Action: Unstack(A, H) — pick up block A that was on top of block H (now holding A).

10) t = 9.0s – 10.0s (dur 1.0s): putdown A
    - Action: Putdown(A) — put held block A down onto the table (now A on table, hand empty).

11) t = 10.0s – 11.0s (dur 1.0s): pickup H
    - Action: Pickup(H) — pick up block H from the table (now holding H).

12) t = 11.0s – 12.0s (dur 1.0s): stack H onto C
    - Action: Stack(H, C) — place held block H onto block C (now H on C, hand empty).

13) t = 12.0s – 13.0s (dur 1.0s): pickup A
    - Action: Pickup(A) — pick up block A from the table (now holding A).

14) t = 13.0s – 14.0s (dur 1.0s): stack A onto H
    - Action: Stack(A, H) — place held block A onto block H (now A on H, hand empty).

Total cost: 14 (14 actions × unit cost 1)

Resulting final arrangement (after executing the steps above):
- A on H
- H on C
- C on F
- F on G
- G on B
- B on I
- I on table
- D on table
- E on table

Final tops (clear): A, E, D
Final hand status: hand empty
