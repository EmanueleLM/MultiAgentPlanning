Plan executed (timestamps and durations are illustrative; each action treated as 1s duration):

1) Time 0s — Duration 1s — Action: unstack(B, L)
   - Preconditions satisfied: B is on L, B is clear, hand is empty.
   - Effect: pick up B. Now holding(B); L becomes clear; B is no longer on L.

2) Time 1s — Duration 1s — Action: putdown(B)
   - Preconditions satisfied: holding(B).
   - Effect: put B on the table. Now ontable(B); B is clear; hand is empty.

3) Time 2s — Duration 1s — Action: unstack(D, F)
   - Preconditions satisfied: D is on F, D is clear, hand is empty.
   - Effect: pick up D. Now holding(D); F becomes clear; D is no longer on F.

4) Time 3s — Duration 1s — Action: stack(D, E)
   - Preconditions satisfied: holding(D), E is clear.
   - Effect: place D on E. Now on(D, E); D is clear; E is no longer clear; hand is empty.

5) Time 4s — Duration 1s — Action: unstack(J, C)
   - Preconditions satisfied: J is on C, J is clear, hand is empty.
   - Effect: pick up J. Now holding(J); C becomes clear; J is no longer on C.

6) Time 5s — Duration 1s — Action: putdown(J)
   - Preconditions satisfied: holding(J).
   - Effect: put J on the table. Now ontable(J); J is clear; hand is empty.

7) Time 6s — Duration 1s — Action: unstack(C, I)
   - Preconditions satisfied: C is on I, C is clear, hand is empty (C was cleared when J was unstacked).
   - Effect: pick up C. Now holding(C); I becomes clear; C is no longer on I.

8) Time 7s — Duration 1s — Action: putdown(C)
   - Preconditions satisfied: holding(C).
   - Effect: put C on the table. Now ontable(C); C is clear; hand is empty.

9) Time 8s — Duration 1s — Action: pickup(I)
   - Preconditions satisfied: I is on the table and is clear (C was removed from I).
   - Effect: pick up I. Now holding(I); I is not on the table; I is not clear; hand is not empty.

10) Time 9s — Duration 1s — Action: stack(I, J)
    - Preconditions satisfied: holding(I), J is clear (J was put down and left clear).
    - Effect: place I on J. Now on(I, J); I is clear; J is no longer clear; hand is empty.
