Summary of initial state (t=00:00:00)
- Stacks on the table:
  - A (bottom), B (top)
  - C, E, J (C bottom → E → J top)
  - K, D (K bottom → D top)
  - H, F (H bottom → F top)
  - G, L, I (G bottom → L → I top)
- Clear (tops): B, J, D, F, I
- Hand: empty

Chronological action report (agent_alpha executed every step). Timestamps are incremental (1s per step) to show ordering and approximate duration.

1) t=00:00:01 — unstack(I, L) by agent_alpha
- Action: remove I from top of L and pick it up.
- Resulting local state: block I is held by agent_alpha; L becomes clear. Stack G-L-I → G-L (L now top/clear); I is in-hand.

2) t=00:00:02 — putdown(I) by agent_alpha
- Action: put the held block I down onto the table.
- Resulting local state: I is now on the table (I is clear). Stacks now include a separate I (on table). G-L remains G (bottom) → L (top/clear).

3) t=00:00:03 — unstack(F, H) by agent_alpha
- Action: remove F from top of H and pick it up.
- Resulting local state: F is held by agent_alpha; H becomes clear. Stack H-F → H (clear); F is in-hand.

4) t=00:00:04 — stack(F, L) by agent_alpha
- Action: place the held F onto L.
- Resulting local state: F is now on L. Stack G-L-I previously became G-L; after stacking it is G (bottom) → L → F (top/clear). Hand is empty.

5) t=00:00:05 — unstack(D, K) by agent_alpha
- Action: remove D from top of K and pick it up.
- Resulting local state: D is held by agent_alpha; K becomes clear. Stack K-D → K (clear); D is in-hand.

6) t=00:00:06 — stack(D, B) by agent_alpha
- Action: place the held D onto B.
- Resulting local state: D is now on B. The original A-B stack becomes A (bottom) → B → D (top/clear). B is no longer clear.

7) t=00:00:07 — unstack(J, E) by agent_alpha
- Action: remove J from top of E and pick it up.
- Resulting local state: J is held by agent_alpha; E becomes clear. Stack C-E-J → C → E (now clear); J is in-hand.

8) t=00:00:08 — stack(J, K) by agent_alpha
- Action: place the held J onto K.
- Resulting local state: J is now on K. Stack K (bottom) → J (top/clear). Hand is empty.

9) t=00:00:09 — unstack(D, B) by agent_alpha
- Action: remove D from top of B and pick it up.
- Resulting local state: D is held by agent_alpha; B becomes clear. The stack A → B → D becomes A → B (B now clear); D is in-hand.

10) t=00:00:10 — stack(D, E) by agent_alpha
- Action: place the held D onto E.
- Resulting local state: D is now on E. Stack C (bottom) → E → D (top/clear). Hand is empty.

11) t=00:00:11 — pickup(H) by agent_alpha
- Action: pick up H from the table (H was clear).
- Resulting local state: H is held by agent_alpha; H is no longer on the table. The H spot is now empty (H in-hand).

12) t=00:00:12 — stack(H, D) by agent_alpha
- Action: place the held H onto D.
- Resulting local state: H is now on D. That stack becomes C → E → D → H (H top/clear). Hand is empty.

13) t=00:00:13 — unstack(B, A) by agent_alpha
- Action: remove B from top of A and pick it up.
- Resulting local state: B is held by agent_alpha; A becomes clear. The A → B stack becomes A (clear); B is in-hand.

14) t=00:00:14 — putdown(B) by agent_alpha
- Action: put the held B down onto the table.
- Resulting local state: B is now on the table (B is clear). A remains on the table (clear). A and B are separate table blocks now.

15) t=00:00:15 — pickup(A) by agent_alpha
- Action: pick up A from the table (A was clear).
- Resulting local state: A is held by agent_alpha; A is no longer on the table. Hand holds A.

16) t=00:00:16 — stack(A, I) by agent_alpha
- Action: place the held A onto I (I is on the table and clear).
- Resulting local state: A is now on I. Stack I (bottom on table) → A (top/clear). Hand is empty.

17) t=00:00:17 — pickup(B) by agent_alpha
- Action: pick up B from the table (B was clear).
- Resulting local state: B is held by agent_alpha; B is no longer on the table. Hand holds B.

18) t=00:00:18 — stack(B, A) by agent_alpha
- Action: place the held B onto A.
- Resulting local state: B is now on A. Final stack at that location is I (bottom) → A → B (top/clear). Hand is empty.

Final arrangement (after step 18, t=00:00:18)
- Stack 1: I (on table) → A → B  (I bottom on table; A on I; B on A)
- Stack 2: C (on table) → E → D → H
- Stack 3: K (on table) → J
- Stack 4: G (on table) → L → F
- All blocks accounted for: A on I; B on A; C on table; D on E; E on C; F on L; G on table; H on D; I on table; J on K; K on table; L on G.
- Hand: empty

Plan cost: 18 actions (unit cost per action).

Notes for the orchestrator
- This chronological report follows the provided plan exactly (18 steps). Each step lists the acting agent (agent_alpha), the action, and the affected stacks after the action.
- Final block arrangement above can be used to build the final PDDL domain/problem instance capturing the achieved goal state.
