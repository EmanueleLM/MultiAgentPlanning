Verification summary
- All 50 actions were legal under standard BlocksWorld rules (only top blocks moved; one block held at a time). No illegal moves detected in this execution log.  
- The final planning step (step50) has been reached.

Final block arrangement (after step 50)
- A on M  
- B on C  
- C on I  
- D on F  
- E on table  
- F on H  
- G on K  
- H on table  
- I on table  
- J on G  
- K on D  
- L on J  
- M on table

Goal: step50 achieved; final arrangement above encodes the post-execution world state.
