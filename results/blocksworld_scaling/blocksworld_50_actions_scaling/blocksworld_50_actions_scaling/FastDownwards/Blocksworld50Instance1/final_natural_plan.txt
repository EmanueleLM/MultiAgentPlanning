Assumed timing: each action takes 1.0 time unit, executed sequentially starting at t = 0.0. Agent executing each action is not specified in the plan, so actions are presented as global steps.

1) Time 0.0–1.0 — Action: Unstack A from J.
   - Effect: A is picked up (holding A). J becomes clear. A is no longer on J.

2) Time 1.0–2.0 — Action: Stack A onto D.
   - Effect: A placed on D. A is no longer held. D is no longer clear. A is clear.

3) Time 2.0–3.0 — Action: Unstack J from E.
   - Effect: J is picked up (holding J). E becomes clear. J is no longer on E.

4) Time 3.0–4.0 — Action: Stack J onto A.
   - Effect: J placed on A. J is clear. A is no longer clear. Nothing held.

5) Time 4.0–5.0 — Action: Unstack K from B.
   - Effect: K is picked up (holding K). B becomes clear. K is no longer on B.

6) Time 5.0–6.0 — Action: Putdown K (onto table).
   - Effect: K placed on the table (ontable K). K is clear. Nothing held.

7) Time 6.0–7.0 — Action: Pickup B (from table).
   - Effect: B is picked up (holding B). B is no longer on the table. B is not clear while held.

8) Time 7.0–8.0 — Action: Stack B onto C.
   - Effect: B placed on C. B is clear. C is no longer clear. Nothing held.

9) Time 8.0–9.0 — Action: Unstack J from A.
   - Effect: J is picked up (holding J). A becomes clear. J is no longer on A.

10) Time 9.0–10.0 — Action: Putdown J (onto table).
    - Effect: J placed on the table (ontable J). J is clear. Nothing held.

11) Time 10.0–11.0 — Action: Unstack A from D.
    - Effect: A is picked up (holding A). D becomes clear. A is no longer on D.

12) Time 11.0–12.0 — Action: Putdown A (onto table).
    - Effect: A placed on the table (ontable A). A is clear. Nothing held.

13) Time 12.0–13.0 — Action: Unstack D from H.
    - Effect: D is picked up (holding D). H becomes clear. D is no longer on H.

14) Time 13.0–14.0 — Action: Putdown D (onto table).
    - Effect: D placed on the table (ontable D). D is clear. Nothing held.

15) Time 14.0–15.0 — Action: Pickup A (from table).
    - Effect: A is picked up (holding A). A is no longer on the table.

16) Time 15.0–16.0 — Action: Stack A onto D.
    - Effect: A placed on D. A is clear. D is no longer clear. Nothing held.

17) Time 16.0–17.0 — Action: Pickup K (from table).
    - Effect: K is picked up (holding K). K is no longer on the table.

18) Time 17.0–18.0 — Action: Stack K onto H.
    - Effect: K placed on H. K is clear. H is no longer clear. Nothing held.

19) Time 18.0–19.0 — Action: Pickup J (from table).
    - Effect: J is picked up (holding J). J is no longer on the table.

20) Time 19.0–20.0 — Action: Stack J onto A.
    - Effect: J placed on A. J is clear. A is no longer clear. Nothing held.

21) Time 20.0–21.0 — Action: Unstack K from H.
    - Effect: K is picked up (holding K). H becomes clear. K is no longer on H.

22) Time 21.0–22.0 — Action: Putdown K (onto table).
    - Effect: K placed on the table (ontable K). K is clear. Nothing held.

23) Time 22.0–23.0 — Action: Pickup H.
    - Effect: H is picked up (holding H). H is no longer clear (while held).

24) Time 23.0–24.0 — Action: Stack H onto E.
    - Effect: H placed on E. H is clear. E is no longer clear. Nothing held.

25) Time 24.0–25.0 — Action: Pickup K (from table).
    - Effect: K is picked up (holding K). K is no longer on the table.

26) Time 25.0–26.0 — Action: Stack K onto H.
    - Effect: K placed on H. K is clear. H is no longer clear. Nothing held.

Final note: after step 26 (t = 26.0) no block is being held (handempty). The above sequence exactly mirrors the provided plan (26 actions, unit cost 26) with assumed durations of 1.0 time unit per action.
