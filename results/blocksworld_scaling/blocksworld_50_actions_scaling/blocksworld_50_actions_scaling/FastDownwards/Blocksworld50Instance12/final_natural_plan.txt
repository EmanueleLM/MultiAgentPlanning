Plan summary (1 step, cost=1):

1) Action (pickup-step g step0 step50)
   - Human-readable: At step0 → step50, pick up block G from the table (one atomic pickup).
   - Start state required: current-step = step0; G is on the table and clear; hand is empty; allow-pickup(step0, G) is true.
   - Effects (result after the action, at step50): G is no longer on the table; G is not clear; the agent is holding G; hand is not empty; current-step becomes step50.
   - Timing: starts at step0 and completes at step50 (the action is represented as a single atomic transition from step0 to step50).
   - Cost: 1

This single action transitions the plan to current-step = step50, satisfying the problem goal.
