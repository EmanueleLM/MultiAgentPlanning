Summary: Executing the given plan step-by-step. Each step shows a timestamp (start time), the action (mapped to block names in uppercase), a short human-readable description of what is done, the immediate effect on the hand and stacks, and an estimated duration (5s per action). Actions are listed exactly in the same order as the provided plan (34 actions, cost = 34).

Timestamps: action i starts at t = (i-1)*5s. Format HH:MM:SS (00:00:00 start).
