- Action: Robot1 picks up D from atop I.
- Resulting state:
  - Stacks: S1: E - C - A - H ; S2: B - G - I ; S3: J

  - Holding: orchestrator holds F; robot1 holds D
  - Notes: robot2 is now hand-empty.

Step 5 (t=4s, dur=1s): robot2 — unstack(A, C)
- Action: Robot2 picks up A from atop C.
- Resulting state:
  - Stacks: S1: E - C ; S2: B - G - I ; S3: J - H
  - Holding: orchestrator holds F; robot1 holds D; robot2 holds A

Step 6 (t=5s, dur=1s): robot1 — putdown(D)
- Action: Robot1 puts D down onto the table (creates a new single-block stack).
- Resulting state:
  - Stacks: S1: E - C ; S2: B - G - I ; S3: J - H ; S4: D
  - Holding: orchestrator holds F; robot1 is hand-empty; robot2 holds A

Step 7 (t=6s, dur=1s): robot1 — unstack(C, E)
- Action: Robot1 picks up C from atop E.
- Resulting state:
  - Stacks: S1: E ; S2: B - G - I ; S3: J - H ; S4: D
  - Holding: orchestrator holds F; robot1 holds C; robot2 holds A

Step 8 (t=7s, dur=1s): orchestrator — putdown(F)
- Action: Orchestrator puts F down onto the table (creates a new single-block stack).
- Resulting state:
  - Stacks: S1: E ; S2: B - G - I ; S3: J - H ; S4: D ; S5: F
  - Holding: robot1 holds C; robot2 holds A; orchestrator is hand-empty

Step 9 (t=8s, dur=1s): orchestrator — unstack(I, G)
- Action: Orchestrator picks up I from atop G.
- Resulting state:
  - Stacks: S1: E ; S2: B - G ; S3: J - H ; S4: D ; S5: F
  - Holding: orchestrator holds I; robot1 holds C; robot2 holds A

Step 10 (t=9s, dur=1s): robot2 — stack(A, G)
- Action: Robot2 places A on top of G.
- Resulting state:
  - Stacks: S1: E ; S2: B - G - A ; S3: J - H ; S4: D ; S5: F
  - Holding: orchestrator holds I; robot1 holds C; robot2 is hand-empty

Step 11 (t=10s, dur=1s): robot1 — stack(C, I)
- Action: Robot1 places C onto I (I is currently held by orchestrator; result is C on I while I remains held).
- Resulting state:
  - Stacks / held-structures:
    - S1: E
    - S2: B - G - A
    - S3: J - H
    - S4: D
    - S5: F
  - In-hand structure: orchestrator holds I with C placed on top → (I (held by orchestrator) - C)
  - Holding: orchestrator holds I (now supporting C); robot1 is hand-empty; robot2 hand-empty
  - Notes: C is now on I (I still not on the table).

Step 12 (t=11s, dur=1s): robot1 — unstack(H, J)
- Action: Robot1 picks up H from atop J.
- Resulting state:
  - Stacks: S1: E ; S2: B - G - A ; S3: J ; S4: D ; S5: F
  - In-hand structure still present: orchestrator holds I with C on it
  - Holding: robot1 holds H; orchestrator holds I(with C); robot2 hand-empty

Step 13 (t=12s, dur=1s): orchestrator — stack(I, H)
- Action: Orchestrator places I (which it was holding, with C on top) onto H (H is currently held by robot1). Result: I on H, with C on I; orchestrator releases I.
- Resulting state:
  - Stacks: S1: E ; S2: B - G - A ; S3: J ; S4: D ; S5: F
  - Held composite: robot1 holds H, and H now supports I with C on top → (H (held by robot1) - I - C)
  - Holding: robot1 holds H(with I and C stacked on it); orchestrator is hand-empty; robot2 hand-empty

Step 14 (t=13s, dur=1s): robot2 — pickup(J)
- Action: Robot2 picks up J from the table.
- Resulting state:
  - Stacks: S1: E ; S2: B - G - A ; S4: D ; S5: F
  - Holding: robot2 holds J; robot1 holds H (with I and C); orchestrator hand-empty
  - Notes: J removed from the table; the J position is now empty until placed.

Step 15 (t=14s, dur=1s): robot2 — stack(J, F)
- Action: Robot2 places J onto F.
- Resulting state:
  - Stacks: S1: E ; S2: B - G - A ; S3: F - J ; S4: D
  - Holding: robot1 holds H (with I and C); robot2 hand-empty; orchestrator hand-empty

Step 16 (t=15s, dur=1s): robot1 — stack(H, J)
- Action: Robot1 places H (with I and C stacked on it) onto J (which is on F). This moves the whole H-I-C stack onto J.
- Resulting state (final snapshot):
  - Stacks (bottom→top):
    - Stack F: F - J - H - I - C
    - Stack B: B - G - A
    - Stack D: D
    - Stack E: E
  - Explicit final relations:
    - A on G
    - B on table
    - C on I
    - D on table
    - E on table
    - F on table (with J on F)
    - G on B
    - H on J
    - I on H
    - J on F
  - Holding: all agents are hand-empty

Summary / verification:
- The 16 actions above exactly follow the given plan in order and produce the final arrangement:
  (on A G), (ontable B), (on C I), (ontable D), (ontable E), (ontable F),
  (on G B), (on H J), (on I H), (on J F).
- Each step is reported with a simple timestamp (start times in 1s increments) and a 1s duration. If you prefer different timestamps or durations, tell me the desired format and I will reformat.
