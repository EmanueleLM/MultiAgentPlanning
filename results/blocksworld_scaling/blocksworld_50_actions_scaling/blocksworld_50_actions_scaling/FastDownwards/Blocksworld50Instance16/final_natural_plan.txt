Execution log (matching the provided plan: no actions)

Timestamp: 00:00:00 (duration: 0s)
- Action: none (plan contains no actions; cost = 0).
- Note: No manipulator actions were executed. The initial state already matches the final arrangement encoded in the PDDL problem, so no moves were necessary.

Final configuration (each block -> what it is immediately on)
- A on table
- B on H
- C on B
- D on J
- E on D
- F on C
- G on K
- H on table
- I on E
- J on G
- K on A
- L on I

Other facts
- handempty (no block is being held)
- clear tops: L and F (they are the top blocks of their stacks)

Summary
- The plan contained zero actions; therefore no step-by-step action trace is produced. The final arrangement above is the state used in the provided PDDL problem.
