Execution timeline (each step duration = 1.0 time unit). I show a short human-readable description and the original plan action in parentheses.

1. t=0.0 → 1.0: Remove block B from on top of block F and hold B. (unstack b f)  
2. t=1.0 → 2.0: Place the held block B onto block I (put B on I). (stack b i)  
3. t=2.0 → 3.0: Remove block F from on top of block L and hold F. (unstack f l)  
4. t=3.0 → 4.0: Place the held block F onto block B (put F on B). (stack f b)  
5. t=4.0 → 5.0: Remove block L from on top of block E and hold L. (unstack l e)  
6. t=5.0 → 6.0: Put the held block L down onto the table (put L on table). (putdown l)  
7. t=6.0 → 7.0: Remove block E from on top of block J and hold E. (unstack e j)  
8. t=7.0 → 8.0: Place the held block E onto block F (put E on F). (stack e f)  
9. t=8.0 → 9.0: Remove block J from on top of block K and hold J. (unstack j k)  
10. t=9.0 → 10.0: Place the held block J onto block L (put J on L). (stack j l)  
11. t=10.0 → 11.0: Remove block K from on top of block A and hold K. (unstack k a)  
12. t=11.0 → 12.0: Put the held block K down onto the table (put K on table). (putdown k)  
13. t=12.0 → 13.0: Remove block J from on top of block L and hold J. (unstack j l)  
14. t=13.0 → 14.0: Put the held block J down onto the table (put J on table). (putdown j)  
15. t=14.0 → 15.0: Pick up block K from the table and hold K. (pickup k)  
16. t=15.0 → 16.0: Place the held block K onto block J (put K on J). (stack k j)  
17. t=16.0 → 17.0: Pick up block L from the table and hold L. (pickup l)  
18. t=17.0 → 18.0: Place the held block L onto block E (put L on E). (stack l e)  
19. t=18.0 → 19.0: Remove block K from on top of block J and hold K. (unstack k j)  
20. t=19.0 → 20.0: Put the held block K down onto the table (put K on table). (putdown k)  
21. t=20.0 → 21.0: Pick up block J from the table and hold J. (pickup j)  
22. t=21.0 → 22.0: Place the held block J onto block L (put J on L). (stack j l)  
23. t=22.0 → 23.0: Pick up block K from the table and hold K. (pickup k)  
24. t=23.0 → 24.0: Place the held block K onto block J (put K on J). (stack k j)

Final verification (final arrangement achieved at t=24.0):
- A is on H
- K is on J
- J is on L
- L is on E
- E is on F
- F is on B
- B is on I
- I is on N
- N is on M
- M is on G
- G is on D
- D is on C
- C is on the table
- H is on the table

This sequence exactly follows the given plan actions (in order) and results in the final configuration above.
