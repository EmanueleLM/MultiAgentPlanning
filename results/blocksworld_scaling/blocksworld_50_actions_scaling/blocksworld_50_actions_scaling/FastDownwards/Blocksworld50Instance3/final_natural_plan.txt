Step 1 — t=00:00:00 → 00:00:10
Action: robot1 unstack B from K.
Effect: robot1 picks up B (robot1 is now holding B). B is removed from on(K). K becomes clear. Local change: the stack rooted at K loses its top block B.

Step 2 — t=00:00:10 → 00:00:20
Action: robot2 unstack F from H.
Effect: robot2 picks up F (robot2 is now holding F). F is removed from on(H). H becomes clear. Local change: the stack rooted at J (J->H->F) loses its top block F.

Step 3 — t=00:00:20 → 00:00:30
Action: robot2 putdown F.
Effect: robot2 places F on the table. F is now ontable and clear. robot2 is handempty. Local change: F becomes a new table-root block.

Step 4 — t=00:00:30 → 00:00:40
Action: robot2 unstack G from I.
Effect: robot2 picks up G (robot2 is now holding G). G is removed from on(I). I becomes clear. Local change: the stack rooted at C (C->I->G) loses its top block G.

Step 5 — t=00:00:40 → 00:00:50
Action: robot2 putdown G.
Effect: robot2 places G on the table. G is now ontable and clear. robot2 is handempty. Local change: G becomes a new table-root block.

Step 6 — t=00:00:50 → 00:01:00
Action: robot2 unstack I from C.
Effect: robot2 picks up I (robot2 is now holding I). I is removed from on(C). C becomes clear. Local change: the stack rooted at C loses its middle block I (temporarily).

Step 7 — t=00:01:00 → 00:01:10
Action: robot2 putdown I.
Effect: robot2 places I on the table. I is now ontable and clear. robot2 is handempty. Local change: I becomes a table-root block.

Step 8 — t=00:01:10 → 00:01:20
Action: robot2 pickup K.
Effect: robot2 picks up K from the table (robot2 is now holding K). K is no longer on the table and not clear while held. Local change: K is removed from the table (it had become clear in Step 1).

Step 9 — t=00:01:20 → 00:01:30
Action: robot2 stack K onto G.
Effect: robot2 places K on top of G. Now (on K G). G is no longer clear; K is clear (top-most of that substack). robot2 is handempty. Local change: a stack rooted at G is formed: G (table) -> K.

Step 10 — t=00:01:30 → 00:01:40
Action: robot2 pickup C.
Effect: robot2 picks up C from the table (robot2 is now holding C). C is no longer on the table and not clear while held. Local change: C is removed from the table (it had been cleared in Step 6).

Step 11 — t=00:01:40 → 00:01:50
Action: robot2 stack C onto K.
Effect: robot2 places C on top of K. Now (on C K). K is no longer clear; C is clear (top of that immediate substack). robot2 is handempty. Local change: the stack at G becomes G (table) -> K -> C.

Step 12 — t=00:01:50 → 00:02:00
Action: robot1 stack B onto C.
Effect: robot1 places the B it has been holding onto C. Now (on B C). C is no longer clear; B is clear (top of that substack). robot1 is handempty. Local change: the stack at G becomes G (table) -> K -> C -> B.

Final status (after all actions)
- Table-root blocks: D, G, F, I, J
- Stacks and placements (for every block):
  - D is on the table.
    - A is on D.
      - L is on A.
        - E is on L.  (stack D->A->L->E)
  - G is on the table.
    - K is on G.
      - C is on K.
        - B is on C.  (stack G->K->C->B)
  - F is on the table (single block).
  - I is on the table (single block).
  - J is on the table.
    - H is on J.  (stack J->H)

Agents final state:
- robot1: handempty
- robot2: handempty

This sequence exactly follows the given plan actions in order and results in the final arrangement summarized above.
