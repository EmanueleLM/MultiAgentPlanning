Sequence of actions (matches the given plan exactly). Start time 00:00:00. Each step duration: 00:00:05.

1) 00:00:00 → 00:00:05 — orchestrator: unstack A from B.  
   (Orchestrator picks up A from top of B.)

2) 00:00:05 → 00:00:10 — robot1: unstack B from K.  
   (Robot1 picks up B from top of K.)

3) 00:00:10 → 00:00:15 — robot2: pickup D from table.  
   (Robot2 picks up block D from the table.)

4) 00:00:15 → 00:00:20 — orchestrator: put A down on table.  
   (Orchestrator places A onto the table.)

5) 00:00:20 → 00:00:25 — robot2: put D onto A.  
   (Robot2 places D on top of A.)

6) 00:00:25 → 00:00:30 — orchestrator: unstack E from G.  
   (Orchestrator picks up E from top of G.)

7) 00:00:30 → 00:00:35 — robot2: pickup G from table.  
   (Robot2 picks up block G from the table.)

8) 00:00:35 → 00:00:40 — robot2: put G onto K.  
   (Robot2 places G on top of K.)

9) 00:00:40 → 00:00:45 — robot2: unstack H from F.  
   (Robot2 picks up H from top of F.)

10) 00:00:45 → 00:00:50 — robot1: put B down on table.  
   (Robot1 places B onto the table.)

11) 00:00:50 → 00:00:55 — orchestrator: put E onto B.  
   (Orchestrator places E on top of B.)

12) 00:00:55 → 00:01:00 — robot1: pickup I from table.  
   (Robot1 picks up I from the table.)

13) 00:01:00 → 00:01:05 — robot1: put I onto F.  
   (Robot1 places I on top of F.)

14) 00:01:05 → 00:01:10 — robot2: put H onto I.  
   (Robot2 places H on top of I.)

End state after these actions (for reference):  
- A on table; D on A  
- B on table; E on B  
- C on J; K on C; J on table  
- F on table; I on F; H on I  
- G on K

Total steps: 14. Total elapsed time (as listed): 00:01:10.
