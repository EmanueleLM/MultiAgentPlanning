This plan outlines the coordinated movements and painting operations of Robot 1 and Robot 2 to achieve the required checkerboard pattern on the floor tiles. The actions are minimized for total cost.

The initial setup is:
*   **Robot 1** is at tile (2,3) and has **white** paint.
*   **Robot 2** is at tile (1,1) and has **black** paint.
*   The target area spans rows 1 through 4.
