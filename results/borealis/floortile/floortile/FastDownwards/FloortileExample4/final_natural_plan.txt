This plan details the coordinated sequence of actions for Robot1 (R1, starting with white paint at T4-1) and Robot2 (R2, starting with black paint at T2-4) to achieve the required checkerboard pattern on the 4x4 floor grid.

Note: Tile coordinates are given as (Row-Column). Tiles are painted only by the robot's action.
