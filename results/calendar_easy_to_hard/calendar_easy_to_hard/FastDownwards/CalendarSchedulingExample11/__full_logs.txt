PROBLEM
------------------------------
You are an expert at scheduling meetings. You are given a few constraints on the existing schedule of each participant, the meeting duration, and possibly some preferences on the meeting time. Note there exists a solution that works with existing schedule of every participant. Here are a few example tasks and solutions:

TASK: You need to schedule a meeting for Michelle, Steven and Jerry for one hour between the work hours of 9:00 to 17:00 on Monday. 

Here are the existing schedules for everyone during the day: 
Michelle has meetings on Monday during 11:00 to 12:00; 
Steven has blocked their calendar on Monday during 9:00 to 9:30, 11:30 to 12:00, 13:30 to 14:00, 15:30 to 16:00; 
Jerry has blocked their calendar on Monday during 9:00 to 9:30, 10:00 to 11:00, 11:30 to 12:30, 13:00 to 14:30, 15:30 to 16:00, 16:30 to 17:00; 

Find a time that works for everyone's schedule and constraints.

PROBLEM
------------------------------
You are an expert at scheduling meetings. You are given a few constraints on the existing schedule of each participant, the meeting duration, and possibly some preferences on the meeting time. Note there exists a solution that works with existing schedule of every participant. Here are a few example tasks and solutions:

TASK: You need to schedule a meeting for Raymond, Billy and Donald for half an hour between the work hours of 9:00 to 17:00 on Monday. 

Here are the existing schedules for everyone during the day: 
Raymond has blocked their calendar on Monday during 9:00 to 9:30, 11:30 to 12:00, 13:00 to 13:30, 15:00 to 15:30; 
Billy has meetings on Monday during 10:00 to 10:30, 12:00 to 13:00, 16:30 to 17:00; 
Donald has meetings on Monday during 9:00 to 9:30, 10:00 to 11:00, 12:00 to 13:00, 14:00 to 14:30, 16:00 to 17:00; 

Billy would like to avoid more meetings on Monday after 15:00. Find a time that works for everyone's schedule and constraints.

NATURAL-PLAN sas_plan_3
------------------------------
Plan (step-by-step, following the provided PDDL plan):

Step 1 — Billy chooses slot3
- Action: choose-billy slot3
- Meaning: Billy selects the candidate meeting time called "slot3" for the 30‑minute meeting.
- Preconditions checked: slot3 is a work-slot and Billy is available at slot3 (both true in the problem).
- Note: slot3 is marked as Billy's preferred slot in the problem.

Step 2 — Donald chooses slot3
- Action: choose-donald slot3
- Meaning: Donald selects the same candidate meeting time "slot3" for the 30‑minute meeting.
- Preconditions checked: slot3 is a work-slot and Donald is available at slot3 (both true in the problem).
- Note: slot3 is also marked as Donald's preferred slot.

Step 3 — Raymond chooses slot3
- Action: choose-raymond slot3
- Meaning: Raymond selects the same candidate meeting time "slot3" for the 30‑minute meeting.
- Preconditions checked: slot3 is a work-slot and Raymond is available at slot3 (both true in the problem).
- Note: slot3 is also marked as Raymond's preferred slot.

Step 4 — Finalize the meeting at slot3
- Action: finalize-meeting slot3
- Meaning / Effects:
  - The meeting is scheduled at slot3.
  - Raymond, Billy, and Donald are marked as attending that slot.
  - The goal meeting-scheduled is achieved.
- Duration and time context: slot3 is a single meeting slot within Monday work hours (the meeting duration is 30 minutes as specified). The plan schedules the meeting for that 30‑minute slot on Monday.

Result: The meeting is scheduled on Monday for 30 minutes at slot3 with Raymond, Billy, and Donald attending.

PROBLEM
------------------------------
You are an expert at scheduling meetings. You are given a few constraints on the existing schedule of each participant, the meeting duration, and possibly some preferences on the meeting time. Note there exists a solution that works with existing schedule of every participant. Here are a few example tasks and solutions:

TASK: You need to schedule a meeting for Roy, Kathryn and Amy for half an hour between the work hours of 9:00 to 17:00 on Monday. 

Here are the existing schedules for everyone during the day: 
Roy has blocked their calendar on Monday during 9:00 to 9:30, 10:00 to 10:30, 11:00 to 11:30, 12:30 to 13:00; 
Kathryn has meetings on Monday during 9:30 to 10:00, 16:30 to 17:00; 
Amy has blocked their calendar on Monday during 9:00 to 14:30, 15:00 to 16:00, 16:30 to 17:00; 

Amy would rather not meet on Monday after 15:30. Find a time that works for everyone's schedule and constraints.

NATURAL-PLAN sas_plan_0
------------------------------
Plan (1 step)

Step 1 — schedule-amy s12
- Action: Amy schedules the meeting for Roy, Kathryn, and herself.
- When: Monday, 14:30 — 15:00 (slot s12).
- Duration: 0.5 hours (30 minutes).
- Participants: Roy, Kathryn, Amy.
- Rationale / preconditions satisfied: Monday is active; s12 is free for Roy, Kathryn, and Amy; no meeting was previously scheduled. Amy also prefers s12.
- Effects: the meeting is scheduled in s12, the global goal (meeting-scheduled) is achieved, and s12 is no longer available (not free) for Roy, Kathryn, or Amy.
================================================================================

PROBLEM
------------------------------
You are an expert at scheduling meetings. You are given a few constraints on the existing schedule of each participant, the meeting duration, and possibly some preferences on the meeting time. Note there exists a solution that works with existing schedule of every participant. Here are a few example tasks and solutions:

TASK: You need to schedule a meeting for Arthur, Michael and Samantha for one hour between the work hours of 9:00 to 17:00 on Monday. 

Here are the existing schedules for everyone during the day: 
Arthur is busy on Monday during 9:00 to 9:30, 10:30 to 12:00, 16:00 to 17:00; 
Michael has meetings on Monday during 13:00 to 13:30, 14:00 to 14:30; 
Samantha has blocked their calendar on Monday during 10:30 to 11:00, 12:00 to 15:00, 15:30 to 17:00; 

Find a time that works for everyone's schedule and constraints.

Michael has meetings on Monday during 13:00 to 13:30, 14:00 to 14:30; 
Samantha has blocked their calendar on Monday during 10:30 to 11:00, 12:00 to 15:00, 15:30 to 17:00; 

Find a time that works for everyone's schedule and constraints.

</problem>

Answer / chosen slot:
- A feasible mutually acceptable 1-hour time is start = s9_30 (09:30–10:30). The combined plan is to invoke the three distinct scheduling actions on s9_30 -> s10_00:
  1) schedule_arthur arthur s9_30 s10_00
  2) schedule_michael m1 s9_30 s10_00
  3) schedule_generic s9_30 s10_00

These three actions (in any order that respects preconditions) achieve all participants' goals.

NATURAL-PLAN sas_plan_0
------------------------------
Plan (steps correspond exactly to the PDDL plan):

1) (schedule_michael m1 s9_30 s10_00)
   - Action: Michael schedules meeting "m1" to start at 09:30.
   - Time covered: 09:30 — 10:30 (two consecutive 30-min slots: s9_30 and s10_00 → 1 hour).
   - Effect: meeting m1 is marked as scheduled for Michael at start 09:30; both 09:30 and 10:00 slots for the meeting are considered for the meeting duration.

2) (schedule_generic s9_30 s10_00)
   - Action: Global/scheduling agent marks the slots as taken and declares the meeting globally scheduled.
   - Time covered: 09:30 — 10:30 (s9_30 and s10_00).
   - Effect: the two slots are removed from the pool of free slots, a global "scheduled" marker is set, and the meeting start is recorded at 09:30.

3) (schedule_arthur arthur s9_30 s10_00)
   - Action: Arthur's calendar is updated to reserve the same two slots for the meeting.
   - Time covered: 09:30 — 10:30 (s9_30 and s10_00).
   - Effect: Arthur's availability for 09:30 and 10:00 is cleared and the meeting is recorded as scheduled for Arthur starting at 09:30.

Result: The meeting is scheduled on Monday from 09:30 to 10:30 (1 hour), satisfying Arthur’s, Michael’s, and Samantha’s constraints and the orchestrator’s goal.

PROBLEM
------------------------------
You are an expert at scheduling meetings. You are given a few constraints on the existing schedule of each participant, the meeting duration, and possibly some preferences on the meeting time. Note there exists a solution that works with existing schedule of every participant. Here are a few example tasks and solutions:

TASK: You need to schedule a meeting for Donna, John and Billy for half an hour between the work hours of 9:00 to 17:00 on Monday. 

Here are the existing schedules for everyone during the day: 
Donna is busy on Monday during 14:00 to 14:30, 15:30 to 16:00; 
John is busy on Monday during 11:00 to 11:30, 16:30 to 17:00; 
Billy is busy on Monday during 9:00 to 10:00, 10:30 to 14:00, 14:30 to 17:00; 

Find a time that works for everyone's schedule and constraints.

Here are a few example tasks and solutions:\n\nTASK: You need to schedule a meeting for Donna, John and Billy for half an hour between the work hours of 9:00 to 17:00 on Monday. \n\nHere are the existing schedules for everyone during the day: \nDonna is busy on Monday during 14:00 to 14:30, 15:30 to 16:00; \nJohn is busy on Monday during 11:00 to 11:30, 16:30 to 17:00; \nBilly is busy on Monday during 9:00 to 10:00, 10:30 to 14:00, 14:30 to 17:00; \n\nFind a time that works for everyone's schedule and constraints. \nSOLUTION: ",

PROBLEM
------------------------------
You are an expert at scheduling meetings. You are given a few constraints on the existing schedule of each participant, the meeting duration, and possibly some preferences on the meeting time. Note there exists a solution that works with existing schedule of every participant. Here are a few example tasks and solutions:

TASK: You need to schedule a meeting for Kathryn, Charlotte and Lauren for half an hour between the work hours of 9:00 to 17:00 on Monday. 

Here are the existing schedules for everyone during the day: 
Kathryn has blocked their calendar on Monday during 9:00 to 9:30, 10:30 to 11:00, 11:30 to 12:00, 13:30 to 14:30, 16:30 to 17:00; 
Charlotte has blocked their calendar on Monday during 12:00 to 12:30, 16:00 to 16:30; 
Lauren has blocked their calendar on Monday during 9:00 to 10:00, 12:00 to 12:30, 13:30 to 14:30, 15:00 to 16:00, 16:30 to 17:00; 

Charlotte do not want to meet on Monday after 13:30. Find a time that works for everyone's schedule and constraints.

Here are a few example tasks and solutions:\n\nTASK: You need to schedule a meeting for Kathryn, Charlotte and Lauren for half an hour between the work hours of 9:00 to 17:00 on Monday. \n\nHere are the existing schedules for everyone during the day: \nKathryn has blocked their calendar on Monday during 9:00 to 9:30, 10:30 to 11:00, 11:30 to 12:00, 13:30 to 14:30, 16:30 to 17:00; \nCharlotte has blocked their calendar on Monday during 12:00 to 12:30, 16:00 to 16:30; \nLauren has blocked their calendar on Monday during 9:00 to 10:00, 12:00 to 12:30, 13:30 to 14:30, 15:00 to 16:00, 16:30 to 17:00; \n\nCharlotte do not want to meet on Monday after 13:30. Find a time that works for everyone's schedule and constraints. \nSOLUTION: ",

Here are a few example tasks and solutions:\n\nTASK: You need to schedule a meeting for Kathryn, Charlotte and Lauren for half an hour between the work hours of 9:00 to 17:00 on Monday. \n\nHere are the existing schedules for everyone during the day: \nKathryn has blocked their calendar on Monday during 9:00 to 9:30, 10:30 to 11:00, 11:30 to 12:00, 13:30 to 14:30, 16:30 to 17:00; \nCharlotte has blocked their calendar on Monday during 12:00 to 12:30, 16:00 to 16:30; \nLauren has blocked their calendar on Monday during 9:00 to 10:00, 12:00 to 12:30, 13:30 to 14:30, 15:00 to 16:00, 16:30 to 17:00; \n\nCharlotte do not want to meet on Monday after 13:30. Find a time that works for everyone's schedule and constraints. \nSOLUTION: ",

NATURAL-PLAN sas_plan_2
------------------------------
Step 1 — schedule-charlotte m1 t1000
- Actor: Charlotte
- Action: Charlotte schedules meeting m1 to start at 10:00 on Monday.
- Time: Monday 10:00 — 10:30 (duration 30 minutes)
- Participants: Kathryn, Charlotte, Lauren
- Why valid:
  - Kathryn is available at 10:00.
  - Charlotte is available at 10:00 (and prefers no meetings after 13:30).
  - Lauren is available at 10:00.
  - The slot is within work hours (09:00–17:00) and matches the required 30-minute meeting duration.
- Effects (resulting state):
  - Meeting m1 is scheduled at 10:00 (meeting-scheduled, meeting-at 10:00, scheduled m1 10:00).
  - m1 is no longer unscheduled and the general not-scheduled flag is cleared.

Final outcome: A single 30-minute meeting for Kathryn, Charlotte and Lauren is scheduled on Monday from 10:00 to 10:30, satisfying all participants' availabilities and preferences.
================================================================================

PROBLEM
------------------------------
You are an expert at scheduling meetings. You are given a few constraints on the existing schedule of each participant, the meeting duration, and possibly some preferences on the meeting time. Note there exists a solution that works with existing schedule of every participant. Here are a few example tasks and solutions:

TASK: You need to schedule a meeting for Thomas, Dylan and Jerry for one hour between the work hours of 9:00 to 17:00 on Monday. 

Here are the existing schedules for everyone during the day: 
Thomas's calendar is wide open the entire day.
Dylan has blocked their calendar on Monday during 10:30 to 11:00, 13:30 to 14:00; 
Jerry is busy on Monday during 9:00 to 11:00, 11:30 to 14:30, 16:00 to 17:00; 

Find a time that works for everyone's schedule and constraints.

NATURAL-PLAN sas_plan_8
------------------------------
1) Orchestrator schedules the meeting:
   - Action taken: orchestrator_schedule(t_14_30, t_15_00, monday)
   - Result: Meeting is scheduled to start on Monday at 14:30.
   - Duration: 60 minutes (uses two consecutive 30-minute timeslots: 14:30–15:00 and 15:00–15:30).
   - Participants: Thomas, Dylan, Jerry — all are available during the required timeslots.
   - Effect: The meeting is no longer "unscheduled" and is marked as starting at 14:30 (ending at 15:30).
================================================================================

PROBLEM
------------------------------
You are an expert at scheduling meetings. You are given a few constraints on the existing schedule of each participant, the meeting duration, and possibly some preferences on the meeting time. Note there exists a solution that works with existing schedule of every participant. Here are a few example tasks and solutions:

TASK: You need to schedule a meeting for Heather, Nicholas and Zachary for half an hour between the work hours of 9:00 to 17:00 on Monday. 

Here are the existing schedules for everyone during the day: 
Heather has blocked their calendar on Monday during 9:00 to 9:30, 10:30 to 11:00, 13:00 to 14:00, 14:30 to 15:00, 16:00 to 16:30; 
Nicholashas no meetings the whole day.
Zachary has blocked their calendar on Monday during 9:00 to 10:30, 11:00 to 12:00, 12:30 to 13:00, 13:30 to 16:30; 

Zachary would rather not meet on Monday after 14:00. Find a time that works for everyone's schedule and constraints.

NATURAL-PLAN sas_plan_2
------------------------------
Plan (1 step) — achieves the goal: schedule a 30-minute meeting on Monday among Heather, Nicholas and Zachary.

Step 1 — schedule_by_heather meeting1 at slot-12-00
- Action performed by: Heather
- Time: Monday 12:00 — 12:30 (30 minutes)
- Participants: Heather, Nicholas, Zachary
- Preconditions satisfied: Heather, Nicholas and Zachary were all available at 12:00.
- Effects (result): 
  - The meeting (meeting1) is scheduled at 12:00–12:30.
  - meeting1 is recorded as with Heather, Nicholas and Zachary.
  - The 12:00–12:30 slot is marked unavailable for Heather, Nicholas and Zachary.
- Notes: Zachary’s preference to avoid meetings after 14:00 is respected (meeting is before 14:00).

Final state: meeting1 is scheduled (goal achieved).
================================================================================

PROBLEM
------------------------------
You are an expert at scheduling meetings. You are given a few constraints on the existing schedule of each participant, the meeting duration, and possibly some preferences on the meeting time. Note there exists a solution that works with existing schedule of every participant. Here are a few example tasks and solutions:

TASK: You need to schedule a meeting for Adam, Jerry and Matthew for half an hour between the work hours of 9:00 to 17:00 on Monday. 

Here are the existing schedules for everyone during the day: 
Adam has meetings on Monday during 10:00 to 10:30, 12:30 to 13:00, 13:30 to 14:30; 
Jerry has blocked their calendar on Monday during 9:00 to 9:30, 12:00 to 12:30, 15:00 to 16:00; 
Matthew has meetings on Monday during 9:30 to 11:00, 11:30 to 12:30, 13:00 to 14:00, 14:30 to 17:00; 

Find a time that works for everyone's schedule and constraints.

NATURAL-PLAN sas_plan_5
------------------------------
Step 1 — Adam schedules the meeting
- Action: Adam executes "schedule-by-adam" for Monday at slot1100.
- Timestamp / duration: Monday 11:00 — 11:30 (30 minutes).
- Attendees: Adam, Jerry, Matthew.
- Context / compliance: This time is within work hours (09:00–17:00) and all three are available at 11:00.
- Resulting state (what this action achieves):
  - A meeting is scheduled.
  - The meeting is set at the 11:00 slot on Monday (11:00–11:30).
  - Adam, Jerry and Matthew are marked as attending that meeting.
  - Adam, Jerry and Matthew are marked busy at the 11:00 slot.
- Goal satisfied: The 30-minute meeting on Monday between 09:00 and 17:00 with Adam, Jerry and Matthew is successfully scheduled.

PROBLEM
------------------------------
You are an expert at scheduling meetings. You are given a few constraints on the existing schedule of each participant, the meeting duration, and possibly some preferences on the meeting time. Note there exists a solution that works with existing schedule of every participant. Here are a few example tasks and solutions:

TASK: You need to schedule a meeting for Diane, Kelly and Deborah for half an hour between the work hours of 9:00 to 17:00 on Monday. 

Here are the existing schedules for everyone during the day: 
Diane has meetings on Monday during 9:00 to 9:30, 12:00 to 12:30, 14:30 to 15:30; 
Kelly has meetings on Monday during 9:30 to 10:00, 10:30 to 11:00; 
Deborah is busy on Monday during 9:00 to 9:30, 10:00 to 14:00, 14:30 to 17:00; 

Find a time that works for everyone's schedule and constraints.

NATURAL-PLAN sas_plan_10
------------------------------
1) Deborah proposes the slot Monday 14:00 — 14:30 (proposes t1400).
   - Action: deborah_propose t1400
   - Reasoning: Deborah is available at 14:00 (her busy intervals are 10:00–14:00 and 14:30–17:00, and t1400 is available in the problem).
   - Effect: the time t1400 is marked as proposed by Deborah.

2) Diane proposes the slot Monday 14:00 — 14:30 (proposes t1400).
   - Action: diane_propose t1400
   - Reasoning: Diane is available at 14:00 (her busy intervals do not include t1400).
   - Effect: the time t1400 is marked as proposed by Diane.

3) Kelly proposes the slot Monday 14:00 — 14:30 (proposes t1400).
   - Action: kelly_propose t1400
   - Reasoning: Kelly is available at 14:00 (her busy intervals do not include t1400).
   - Effect: the time t1400 is marked as proposed by Kelly.

4) Orchestrator confirms the meeting at Monday 14:00 — 14:30 (orchestrator_confirm t1400).
   - Action: orchestrator_confirm t1400
   - Preconditions met: Deborah, Diane, and Kelly have all proposed t1400; t1400 is within work hours (09:00–17:00); and all three are free at t1400.
   - Effect: the meeting is confirmed and scheduled at 14:00–14:30 on Monday for Diane, Kelly, and Deborah; t1400 is no longer free for those participants.

Result: Meeting scheduled and confirmed for Monday 14:00–14:30 (30 minutes) with Diane, Kelly, and Deborah.

PROBLEM
------------------------------
You are an expert at scheduling meetings. You are given a few constraints on the existing schedule of each participant, the meeting duration, and possibly some preferences on the meeting time. Note there exists a solution that works with existing schedule of every participant. Here are a few example tasks and solutions:

TASK: You need to schedule a meeting for Denise, Joseph, Henry and Christian for one hour between the work hours of 9:00 to 17:00 on Monday. 

Here are the existing schedules for everyone during the day: 
Denise's calendar is wide open the entire day.
Josephhas no meetings the whole day.
Henry has meetings on Monday during 9:00 to 9:30, 10:00 to 10:30, 12:00 to 14:30, 15:00 to 16:00, 16:30 to 17:00; 
Christian is busy on Monday during 9:00 to 11:00, 14:30 to 15:30, 16:00 to 17:00; 

Find a time that works for everyone's schedule and constraints.

You have to orchestrate them to solve the following task: {agents->orchestrator->goal} Keep in mind that the PDDL they send you may be partial or contain ambiguities. A partial PDDL may partially solve a planning problem, but it may require integrating additional information from the other PDDL responses to achieve the goal. Ambiguities may appear in different forms, such as two PDDL problems referring to the same time slot with different names. Here is the information the first agent has and its PDDL response: {pddl_diana} Here is the information the second agent has and its PDDL response: {pddl_ethan} Here is the information the third agent has and its PDDL response: {pddl_janet} You need to integrate the PDDL responses of the three agents to produce a combined PDDL domain and a PDDL problem file that FastDownwards can solve. It is important that you keep the actions of the three agents distinct. Think step by step and provide a PDDL domain and a PDDL problem file.

NATURAL-PLAN sas_plan_1
------------------------------
1) Diana reserves meeting1 at 10:00 on Monday (timeslot t1000 — 10:00–10:30, duration 30 minutes).
   - Action matched: diana_reserve meeting1 t1000
   - Result: Diana marks herself reserved for the 10:00–10:30 slot and the slot is no longer available for others.

2) Janet reserves meeting1 at 10:00 on Monday (timeslot t1000 — 10:00–10:30).
   - Action matched: janet_reserve meeting1 t1000
   - Notes: 10:00 is within the allowed window (09:00–17:00) and is consistent with Janet’s preference (she prefers not to meet after 12:00). Janet marks herself reserved for 10:00–10:30; her availability flag for scheduling is updated accordingly.

3) Ethan reserves meeting1 at 10:00 on Monday (timeslot t1000 — 10:00–10:30).
   - Action matched: ethan_reserve meeting1 t1000
   - Result: Ethan marks himself reserved for the 10:00–10:30 slot.

4) Orchestrator finalizes the meeting: meeting1 is scheduled at 10:00 on Monday (timeslot t1000 — 10:00–10:30, 30 minutes).
   - Action matched: finalize_meeting meeting1 t1000
   - Final outcome: The meeting is confirmed for Monday 10:00–10:30 with Diana, Janet, and Ethan; all participant reservations are recorded and the meeting is scheduled.

PROBLEM
------------------------------
You are an expert at scheduling meetings. You are given a few constraints on the existing schedule of each participant, the meeting duration, and possibly some preferences on the meeting time. Note there exists a solution that works with existing schedule of every participant. Here are a few example tasks and solutions:

TASK: You need to schedule a meeting for Madison, Linda, Logan and Virginia for half an hour between the work hours of 9:00 to 17:00 on Monday. 

Here are the existing schedules for everyone during the day: 
Madison has blocked their calendar on Monday during 10:00 to 10:30, 14:30 to 15:00, 15:30 to 16:00, 16:30 to 17:00; 
Lindahas no meetings the whole day.
Logan has meetings on Monday during 9:00 to 12:00, 12:30 to 16:00, 16:30 to 17:00; 
Virginia has blocked their calendar on Monday during 9:30 to 11:00, 11:30 to 12:00, 13:00 to 14:30, 15:00 to 15:30, 16:00 to 17:00; 

Find a time that works for everyone's schedule and constraints.

Here is the information the first agent has and its PDDL response: {pddl_Alexander} Here is the information the second agent has and its PDDL response: {pddl_Elizabeth} Here is the information the third agent has and its PDDL response: {pddl_Walter} You need to integrate the PDDL responses of the three agents to produce a single PDDL domain and PDDL problem file that the FastDownward PDDL solver can use to find a 30 minute meeting time that satisfies all participants. It is very important that you keep the actions and constraints of each participant distinct. Think step by step and provide a PDDL domain and a PDDL problem file. Enclose the PDDL domain between <domain></domain> tags and the PDDL problem between <problem></problem> tags."

NATURAL-PLAN sas_plan_10
------------------------------
Mapping used (domain → real participants):
- madison → Alexander
- linda   → Elizabeth
- logan   → Walter
- virginia → orchestrator

Planned actions (follow plan exactly):

1) virginia (orchestrator) agrees to the meeting at 12:00 — i.e., orchestrator indicates availability for the 12:00–12:30 Monday slot.

2) madison (Alexander) agrees to the meeting at 12:00 — Alexander indicates availability for the 12:00–12:30 Monday slot.

3) logan (Walter) agrees to the meeting at 12:00 — Walter indicates availability for the 12:00–12:30 Monday slot.

4) linda (Elizabeth) agrees to the meeting at 12:00 — Elizabeth indicates availability for the 12:00–12:30 Monday slot.

5) finalize_meeting at 12:00 — the meeting is scheduled for Monday 12:00–12:30. The meeting is marked as scheduled and the participants are recorded as attending.

Result: A 30-minute meeting is scheduled on Monday from 12:00 to 12:30 with Alexander, Elizabeth and Walter (orchestrator facilitated and also agreed). This satisfies the requirement to find a 30-minute Monday meeting within work hours.
