PROBLEM
------------------------------
You are an expert at scheduling meetings. You are given a few constraints on the existing schedule of each participant, the meeting duration, and possibly some preferences on the meeting time. Note there exists a solution that works with existing schedule of every participant. Here are a few example tasks and solutions:

TASK: You need to schedule a meeting for Karen, Brandon, Donald and Kelly for half an hour between the work hours of 9:00 to 17:00 on Monday. 

Here are the existing schedules for everyone during the day: 
Karen has blocked their calendar on Monday during 9:00 to 10:30, 16:30 to 17:00; 
Brandon has blocked their calendar on Monday during 9:30 to 10:00, 10:30 to 11:00, 11:30 to 12:30, 15:30 to 16:00, 16:30 to 17:00; 
Donald has blocked their calendar on Monday during 9:00 to 10:30, 11:00 to 14:00, 14:30 to 17:00; 
Kelly is busy on Monday during 9:00 to 9:30, 10:30 to 11:00, 11:30 to 12:00, 13:30 to 14:00, 14:30 to 15:30, 16:00 to 17:00; 

Find a time that works for everyone's schedule and constraints.

You are given a few constraints on the existing schedule of each participant, the meeting duration, and possibly some preferences on the meeting time. Note there exists a solution that works with existing schedule of every participant. Here are a few example tasks and solutions:\n\nTASK: You need to schedule a meeting for Karen, Brandon, Donald and Kelly for half an hour between the work hours of 9:00 to 17:00 on Monday. \n\nHere are the existing schedules for everyone during the day: \nKaren has blocked their calendar on Monday during 9:00 to 10:30, 16:30 to 17:00; \nBrandon has blocked their calendar on Monday during 9:30 to 10:00, 10:30 to 11:00, 11:30 to 12:30, 15:30 to 16:00, 16:30 to 17:00; \nDonald has blocked their calendar on Monday during 9:00 to 10:30, 11:00 to 14:00, 14:30 to 17:00; \nKelly is busy on Monday during 9:00 to 9:30, 10:30 to 11:00, 11:30 to 12:00, 13:30 to 14:00, 14:30 to 15:30, 16:00 to 17:00; \n\nFind a time that works for everyone's schedule and constraints. \nSOLUTION: ",

You are given a few constraints on the existing schedule of each participant, the meeting duration, and possibly some preferences on the meeting time. Note there exists a solution that works with existing schedule of every participant. Here are a few example tasks and solutions:\n\nTASK: You need to schedule a meeting for Karen, Brandon, Donald and Kelly for half an hour between the work hours of 9:00 to 17:00 on Monday. \n\nHere are the existing schedules for everyone during the day: \nKaren has blocked their calendar on Monday during 9:00 to 10:30, 16:30 to 17:00; \nBrandon has blocked their calendar on Monday during 9:30 to 10:00, 10:30 to 11:00, 11:30 to 12:30, 15:30 to 16:00, 16:30 to 17:00; \nDonald has blocked their calendar on Monday during 9:00 to 10:30, 11:00 to 14:00, 14:30 to 17:00; \nKelly is busy on Monday during 9:00 to 9:30, 10:30 to 11:00, 11:30 to 12:00, 13:30 to 14:00, 14:30 to 15:30, 16:00 to 17:00; \n\nFind a time that works for everyone's schedule and constraints. \nSOLUTION: ",

NATURAL-PLAN sas_plan_10
------------------------------
Step 1 — schedule-by-brandon t14_00
- Action: Brandon schedules the meeting.
- Scheduled time (timestamp): Monday 14:00 — meeting duration 30 minutes → 14:00–14:30.
- Attendees (as required by the specification): Brandon, Jerry, Bradley.

Compliance check against the specification
- Brandon's private info: meetings 13:00–14:00, 15:30–16:00, 16:30–17:00; preference to avoid meetings before 14:30. The 14:00–14:30 slot starts immediately after his 13:00–14:00 meeting and violates his stated preference (preference, not necessarily a hard constraint).
- Bradley's private info: meetings 09:00–11:30, 12:00–15:00, 16:00–16:30. The 14:00–14:30 slot falls inside Bradley's 12:00–15:00 busy period — Bradley is unavailable at 14:00.
- Jerry's private info: no meetings on Monday — Jerry is available.

Result
- The plan's single action schedules the meeting at Monday 14:00–14:30, but this does NOT satisfy the specification requirement that the meeting "works for all participants" because Bradley is unavailable at that time (and it also conflicts with Brandon's preference to avoid meetings before 14:30).
- If you want a time that satisfies all hard constraints and Brandon's preference, a feasible alternative is 15:00–15:30 (Brandon and Bradley are available then; Jerry is available).
