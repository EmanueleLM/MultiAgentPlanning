PROBLEM
------------------------------
You are an expert at scheduling meetings. You are given a few constraints on the existing schedule of each participant, the meeting duration, and possibly some preferences on the meeting time. Note there exists a solution that works with existing schedule of every participant. Here are a few example tasks and solutions:

TASK: You need to schedule a meeting for Peter, Judith, Keith and Evelyn for half an hour between the work hours of 9:00 to 17:00 on Monday. 

Here are the existing schedules for everyone during the day: 
Peter has meetings on Monday during 9:00 to 9:30, 10:30 to 11:00, 11:30 to 12:00, 12:30 to 13:00; 
Judith's calendar is wide open the entire day.
Keith has blocked their calendar on Monday during 11:30 to 12:00, 12:30 to 15:00, 15:30 to 16:00, 16:30 to 17:00; 
Evelyn is busy on Monday during 9:00 to 12:30, 13:30 to 15:30, 16:30 to 17:00; 

Find a time that works for everyone's schedule and constraints.
