Step 1 — schedule-slot s11 (14:00–14:30), participants: anthony, anthony, anthony, anthony
- Action (from plan): (schedule-slot s11 anthony anthony anthony anthony)
- Slot s11 corresponds to Monday 14:00–14:30 (30 minutes).
- Effect: mark slot s11 as scheduled and the goal meeting-scheduled is achieved.
- Plan cost: 1

Note: The PDDL plan schedules the 30‑minute meeting in slot s11 (14:00–14:30) using "anthony" for all participant parameters (the action as given). This achieves the PDDL goal (meeting-scheduled). However, per the original specification that "All participants must attend the same 30 minute slot," this plan does not include lisa, dorothy, or ryan as attendees — so it does not satisfy that particular specification requirement even though it matches the provided PDDL plan exactly.
