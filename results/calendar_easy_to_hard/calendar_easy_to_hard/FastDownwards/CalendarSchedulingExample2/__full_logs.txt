PROBLEM
------------------------------
You are an expert at scheduling meetings. You are given a few constraints on the existing schedule of each participant, the meeting duration, and possibly some preferences on the meeting time. Note there exists a solution that works with existing schedule of every participant. Here are a few example tasks and solutions:

TASK: You need to schedule a meeting for Michelle, Steven and Jerry for one hour between the work hours of 9:00 to 17:00 on Monday. 

Here are the existing schedules for everyone during the day: 
Michelle has meetings on Monday during 11:00 to 12:00; 
Steven has blocked their calendar on Monday during 9:00 to 9:30, 11:30 to 12:00, 13:30 to 14:00, 15:30 to 16:00; 
Jerry has blocked their calendar on Monday during 9:00 to 9:30, 10:00 to 11:00, 11:30 to 12:30, 13:00 to 14:30, 15:30 to 16:00, 16:30 to 17:00; 

Find a time that works for everyone's schedule and constraints.

2) Michelle attends the meeting starting at 14:30 for one hour (covers 14:30–15:30; the two 30‑minute slots 14:30–15:00 and 15:00–15:30).

3) Jerry attends the meeting starting at 14:30 for one hour (covers 14:30–15:30; the two 30‑minute slots 14:30–15:00 and 15:00–15:30).

4) Orchestrator finalizes the meeting: meeting scheduled to start at 14:30 (14:30–15:30).

PROBLEM
------------------------------
You are an expert at scheduling meetings. You are given a few constraints on the existing schedule of each participant, the meeting duration, and possibly some preferences on the meeting time. Note there exists a solution that works with existing schedule of every participant. Here are a few example tasks and solutions:

TASK: You need to schedule a meeting for Raymond, Billy and Donald for half an hour between the work hours of 9:00 to 17:00 on Monday. 

Here are the existing schedules for everyone during the day: 
Raymond has blocked their calendar on Monday during 9:00 to 9:30, 11:30 to 12:00, 13:00 to 13:30, 15:00 to 15:30; 
Billy has meetings on Monday during 10:00 to 10:30, 12:00 to 13:00, 16:30 to 17:00; 
Donald has meetings on Monday during 9:00 to 9:30, 10:00 to 11:00, 12:00 to 13:00, 14:00 to 14:30, 16:00 to 17:00; 

Billy would like to avoid more meetings on Monday after 15:00. Find a time that works for everyone's schedule and constraints.

NATURAL-PLAN sas_plan_1
------------------------------
Step 1 — schedule-by-billy (t0930):
- Actor: Billy
- Action: Schedule the 30-minute meeting
- Day & time: Monday, 09:30 — 10:00 (t0930)
- Participants: Raymond, Billy, Donald
- Result: Meeting is scheduled at 09:30 (meeting-at t0930). This respects all participants' availabilities and Billy's preference (meeting before 15:00).
================================================================================


PROBLEM
------------------------------
You are an expert at scheduling meetings. You are given a few constraints on the existing schedule of each participant, the meeting duration, and possibly some preferences on the meeting time. Note there exists a solution that works with existing schedule of every participant. Here are a few example tasks and solutions:

TASK: You need to schedule a meeting for Roy, Kathryn and Amy for half an hour between the work hours of 9:00 to 17:00 on Monday. 

Here are the existing schedules for everyone during the day: 
Roy has blocked their calendar on Monday during 9:00 to 9:30, 10:00 to 10:30, 11:00 to 11:30, 12:30 to 13:00; 
Kathryn has meetings on Monday during 9:30 to 10:00, 16:30 to 17:00; 
Amy has blocked their calendar on Monday during 9:00 to 14:30, 15:00 to 16:00, 16:30 to 17:00; 

Amy would rather not meet on Monday after 15:30. Find a time that works for everyone's schedule and constraints.

------------------------------
1) Roy proposes the 30‑minute slot 14:30–15:00 (propose-roy s1430_1500).

2) Kathryn proposes the 30‑minute slot 14:30–15:00 (propose-kathryn s1430_1500).

3) Amy proposes the 30‑minute slot 14:30–15:00 (propose-amy s1430_1500). This slot is before 15:30 and therefore satisfies Amy’s preference.

4) Orchestrator finalizes and schedules the meeting at 14:30–15:00 (orchestrator-finalize s1430_1500). The meeting is now scheduled.
