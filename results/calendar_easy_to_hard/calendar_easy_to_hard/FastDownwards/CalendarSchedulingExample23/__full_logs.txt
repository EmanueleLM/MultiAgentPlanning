PROBLEM
------------------------------
You are an expert at scheduling meetings. You are given a few constraints on the existing schedule of each participant, the meeting duration, and possibly some preferences on the meeting time. Note there exists a solution that works with existing schedule of every participant. Here are a few example tasks and solutions:

TASK: You need to schedule a meeting for Elijah, Janet, Brian, Carl and Timothy for half an hour between the work hours of 9:00 to 17:00 on Monday. 

Here are the existing schedules for everyone during the day: 
Elijah is busy on Monday during 10:00 to 11:00, 12:00 to 12:30, 15:00 to 15:30; 
Janet has meetings on Monday during 9:30 to 10:30, 13:30 to 15:30; 
Brianhas no meetings the whole day.
Carl has meetings on Monday during 9:30 to 16:30; 
Timothy is busy on Monday during 10:30 to 12:00, 13:30 to 14:00, 14:30 to 16:00, 16:30 to 17:00; 

Find a time that works for everyone's schedule and constraints.

Your job is to integrate participants' availability reports and produce a PDDL domain and a PDDL problem that schedules a single 30-minute meeting on Monday between 09:00 and 17:00 for all participants. You must enclose the PDDL domain between <domain></domain> tags and the PDDL problem between <problem></problem> tags. Use discrete 30-minute time slots matching the environment's resolution. Ensure the PDDL is compatible with FastDownward (STRIPS/adl as appropriate) and clearly models participants, time slots, availability constraints, and a single meeting assignment.",
