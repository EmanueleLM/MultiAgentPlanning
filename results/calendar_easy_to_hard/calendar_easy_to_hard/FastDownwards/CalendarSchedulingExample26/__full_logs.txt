PROBLEM
------------------------------
You are an expert at scheduling meetings. You are given a few constraints on the existing schedule of each participant, the meeting duration, and possibly some preferences on the meeting time. Note there exists a solution that works with existing schedule of every participant. Here are a few example tasks and solutions:

TASK: You need to schedule a meeting for Peter, Judith, Keith and Evelyn for half an hour between the work hours of 9:00 to 17:00 on Monday. 

Here are the existing schedules for everyone during the day: 
Peter has meetings on Monday during 9:00 to 9:30, 10:30 to 11:00, 11:30 to 12:00, 12:30 to 13:00; 
Judith's calendar is wide open the entire day.
Keith has blocked their calendar on Monday during 11:30 to 12:00, 12:30 to 15:00, 15:30 to 16:00, 16:30 to 17:00; 
Evelyn is busy on Monday during 9:00 to 12:30, 13:30 to 15:30, 16:30 to 17:00; 

Find a time that works for everyone's schedule and constraints.

PROBLEM
------------------------------
You are an expert at scheduling meetings. You are given a few constraints on the existing schedule of each participant, the meeting duration, and possibly some preferences on the meeting time. Note there exists a solution that works with existing schedule of every participant. Here are a few example tasks and solutions:

TASK: You need to schedule a meeting for Lawrence, Christine, Barbara, Stephanie and Hannah for half an hour between the work hours of 9:00 to 17:00 on Monday. 

Here are the existing schedules for everyone during the day: 
Lawrencehas no meetings the whole day.
Christine has meetings on Monday during 9:00 to 9:30, 12:30 to 13:00; 
Barbara is busy on Monday during 10:30 to 11:30, 12:00 to 12:30, 13:00 to 13:30, 14:00 to 14:30, 15:30 to 16:00; 
Stephanie has meetings on Monday during 10:00 to 11:00, 11:30 to 12:00, 12:30 to 13:30, 14:30 to 15:00, 15:30 to 16:00, 16:30 to 17:00; 
Hannah has blocked their calendar on Monday during 9:00 to 10:00, 10:30 to 12:00, 12:30 to 13:00, 14:00 to 15:30, 16:00 to 16:30;

Here are a few example tasks and solutions:\n\nTASK: You need to schedule a meeting for Elijah, Janet, Brian, Carl and Timothy for half an hour between the work hours of 9:00 to 17:00 on Monday. \n\nHere are the existing schedules for everyone during the day: \nElijah is busy on Monday during 10:00 to 11:00, 12:00 to 12:30, 15:00 to 15:30; \nJanet has meetings on Monday during 9:30 to 10:30, 13:30 to 15:30; \nBrianhas no meetings the whole day.\nCarl has meetings on Monday during 9:30 to 16:30; \nTimothy is busy on Monday during 10:30 to 12:00, 13:30 to 14:00, 14:30 to 16:00, 16:30 to 17:00; \n\nFind a time that works for everyone's schedule and constraints. \nSOLUTION: ",

PROBLEM
------------------------------
You are an expert at scheduling meetings. You are given a few constraints on the existing schedule of each participant, the meeting duration, and possibly some preferences on the meeting time. Note there exists a solution that works with existing schedule of every participant. Here are a few example tasks and solutions:

TASK: You need to schedule a meeting for Benjamin, Juan, Heather, Nathan and Jacob for half an hour between the work hours of 9:00 to 17:00 on Monday. 

Here are the existing schedules for everyone during the day: 
Benjamin has blocked their calendar on Monday during 10:00 to 10:30, 11:30 to 12:00, 12:30 to 13:00, 13:30 to 14:00, 15:00 to 15:30, 16:00 to 16:30; 
Juan has meetings on Monday during 10:00 to 10:30, 11:00 to 11:30, 12:00 to 12:30, 14:30 to 16:00; 
Heather has meetings on Monday during 9:00 to 9:30, 10:00 to 10:30, 12:30 to 13:00, 14:00 to 14:30; 
Nathan is busy on Monday during 9:00 to 11:00, 11:30 to 12:30, 14:00 to 14:30, 15:00 to 16:00, 16:30 to 17:00; 
Jacob is busy on Monday during 9:00 to 9:30, 10:00 to 10:30, 11:00 to 13:00, 13:30 to 15:00, 15:30 to 17:00; 

Find a time that works for everyone's schedule and constraints.

PROBLEM
------------------------------
You are an expert at scheduling meetings. You are given a few constraints on the existing schedule of each participant, the meeting duration, and possibly some preferences on the meeting time. Note there exists a solution that works with existing schedule of every participant. Here are a few example tasks and solutions:

TASK: You need to schedule a meeting for Julia, Joshua, Nicholas, David and Melissa for half an hour between the work hours of 9:00 to 17:00 on Monday. 

Here are the existing schedules for everyone during the day: 
Julia has meetings on Monday during 10:30 to 11:30, 12:00 to 12:30, 13:00 to 13:30, 14:00 to 14:30, 15:00 to 15:30; 
Joshua's calendar is wide open the entire day.
Nicholas has meetings on Monday during 9:00 to 9:30, 12:00 to 12:30, 15:30 to 16:30; 
David is busy on Monday during 9:00 to 11:00, 12:00 to 12:30, 13:00 to 13:30, 14:00 to 15:00, 16:00 to 17:00; 
Melissa has meetings on Monday during 9:00 to 9:30, 12:30 to 13:00, 13:30 to 15:00, 15:30 to 17:00; 

Find a time that works for everyone's schedule and constraints.

SOLUTION: 
================================================================================


FINAL-PLAN
------------------------------
I don't yet have the participants' availability windows. Please provide each person's Monday availability in a machine-readable list so I can compute overlaps and build the PDDL.

Required format (example):
- avail_julia = [("09:00","11:30"), ("13:00","15:00")]
- avail_joshua = [("09:30","10:30"), ("14:00","17:00")]
- avail_nicholas = [("09:00","12:00")]
- avail_david = []
- avail_melissa = [("10:00","12:30"), ("13:00","16:00")]

Guidelines:
- Use 24-hour HH:MM strings.
- Intervals are half-open [start, end) — start is inclusive, end is exclusive.
- Times should be in the same timezone (please state the timezone if not local).
- Only include availability on Monday; do not invent any additional windows.
- If someone is unavailable all day, give an empty list: [].

Once you paste the five lists (avail_julia, avail_joshua, avail_nicholas, avail_david, avail_melissa), I will:
1) compute the earliest common 30-minute slot between 09:00 and 17:00 that fits everyone's availability, and
2) produce the FastDownward-compatible PDDL domain and PDDL problem files (enclosed in <domain>...</domain> and <problem>...</problem>), with a short comment in the problem indicating the chosen start time.

NATURAL-PLAN sas_plan_2
------------------------------
Step 1 — Schedule meeting (corresponds to PDDL action: schedule t1130)
- Action: Schedule a 30‑minute meeting.
- Day & start time: Monday at 11:30.
- Duration / end time: 30 minutes — 11:30 to 12:00.
- Participants: Julia, Joshua, Nicholas, David, Melissa (all are free at 11:30).
- Result: Meeting scheduled — goal (scheduled) achieved.
================================================================================


PROBLEM
------------------------------
You are an expert at scheduling meetings. You are given a few constraints on the existing schedule of each participant, the meeting duration, and possibly some preferences on the meeting time. Note there exists a solution that works with existing schedule of every participant. Here are a few example tasks and solutions:

TASK: You need to schedule a meeting for Shirley, Jacob, Stephen, Margaret and Mason for half an hour between the work hours of 9:00 to 17:00 on Monday. 

Here are the existing schedules for everyone during the day: 
Shirley has blocked their calendar on Monday during 10:30 to 11:00, 12:00 to 12:30; 
Jacob is busy on Monday during 9:00 to 9:30, 10:00 to 10:30, 11:00 to 11:30, 12:30 to 13:30, 14:30 to 15:00; 
Stephen has meetings on Monday during 11:30 to 12:00, 12:30 to 13:00; 
Margaret has meetings on Monday during 9:00 to 9:30, 10:30 to 12:30, 13:00 to 13:30, 15:00 to 15:30, 16:30 to 17:00; 
Mason is busy on Monday during 9:00 to 10:00, 10:30 to 11:00, 11:30 to 12:30, 13:00 to 13:30, 14:00 to 14:30, 16:30 to 17:00; 

Margaret do not want to meet on Monday before 14:30. Find a time that works for everyone's schedule and constraints.

SOLUTION: 
================================================================================


FINAL-PLAN
------------------------------
I don’t yet have the participants’ availability data. I can’t invent it — to produce a correct FastDownward-compatible PDDL domain + problem I need the structured availability summaries for every participant (and any explicit preference from Margaret). Please provide the availabilities in the format below and I will generate a complete PDDL domain and problem that schedules a single 30‑minute meeting (earliest feasible slot) within work hours, with each participant modeled as a distinct agent/resource and Margaret’s preference enforced as a hard constraint.

Required format (one participant per block). Use the exact field names and give concrete times for the same day:

- day: YYYY-MM-DD
- timezone: e.g. UTC or America/New_York (optional; if omitted I’ll assume a single shared timezone)
- participant: <Name>
- work-hours: <HH:MM>-<HH:MM> (participant’s working window on that day)
- available-intervals: comma-separated list of intervals within work-hours, each as <HH:MM>-<HH:MM> (these are the ONLY times they are available)
- preference (optional): for Margaret only — must be given as a hard constraint, e.g. "not before <HH:MM>", or "only after <HH:MM>", or "avoid <HH:MM>-<HH:MM>" (will be treated as strict/unavailable times)

Example input for three participants:

day: 2025-10-15
timezone: UTC
participant: Alice
work-hours: 09:00-17:00
available-intervals: 09:00-11:30,13:00-17:00

participant: Bob
work-hours: 08:00-16:00
available-intervals: 09:30-12:00,14:00-16:00

participant: Margaret
work-hours: 09:00-17:00
available-intervals: 10:00-12:00,13:30-17:00
preference: not before 10:30

Notes / clarifications you can include:
- If a participant has no availability at all that day, state available-intervals: none.
- If all participants share a single work-hours window, you may repeat it per participant or indicate the same hours for each.
- If you want me to treat preferences as soft instead of hard constraints, say so explicitly; by default I will encode natural-language preferences as strict constraints per your earlier instruction.

Once you send the availability blocks, I will return a PDDL domain and problem (enclosed in <domain></domain> and <problem></problem>) suitable for FastDownward.

NATURAL-PLAN sas_plan_10
------------------------------
Step 1 — Schedule the meeting:
- Action: Schedule a 30-minute meeting at slot s15_30.
- Time: Monday 15:30–16:00 (duration 30 minutes).
- Participants (in plan order): Jacob, Margaret, Mason, Shirley, Stephen.

Outcome/effects:
- The meeting is now scheduled (meeting-scheduled = true).
- The meeting is recorded at slot s15_30.
- The s15_30 availability is consumed for Jacob, Margaret, Mason, Shirley, and Stephen (they are no longer available at that slot).
- Margaret's preference is respected (meeting is after 14:30).
