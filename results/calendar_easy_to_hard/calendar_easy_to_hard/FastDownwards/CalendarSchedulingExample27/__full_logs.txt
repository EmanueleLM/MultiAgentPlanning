PROBLEM
------------------------------
You are an expert at scheduling meetings. You are given a few constraints on the existing schedule of each participant, the meeting duration, and possibly some preferences on the meeting time. Note there exists a solution that works with existing schedule of every participant. Here are a few example tasks and solutions:

TASK: You need to schedule a meeting for Walter, Danielle, Julia, Samuel and Lori for half an hour between the work hours of 9:00 to 17:00 on Monday. 

Here are the existing schedules for everyone during the day: 
Walter's calendar is wide open the entire day.
Danielle is free the entire day.
Julia has blocked their calendar on Monday during 9:30 to 10:00, 10:30 to 11:00, 13:30 to 14:00, 16:00 to 16:30; 
Samuel has meetings on Monday during 9:00 to 11:00, 11:30 to 12:30, 13:00 to 14:30, 15:00 to 15:30, 16:00 to 17:00; 
Lori is busy on Monday during 10:00 to 10:30, 11:00 to 11:30, 12:00 to 12:30, 13:00 to 14:30, 15:00 to 17:00; 

You would like to schedule the meeting at their earlist availability.
Find a time that works for everyone's schedule and constraints.

FINAL-PLAN
------------------------------
I don’t yet have the five availability arrays. Please provide avail_walter, avail_danielle, avail_julia, avail_samuel, and avail_lori as lists of available 30‑minute slots on Monday between 09:00 and 17:00 (slots are 09:00, 09:30, 10:00, …, 16:30). Example format:

avail_walter = ["09:00", "09:30", "10:00", ...]  
avail_danielle = ["09:30", "10:00", ...]  
...

Once you supply those arrays I will produce the FastDownward-compatible PDDL domain and problem (two tagged blocks only) that choose the earliest slot free for all five.
