     - All three participants are free at 9:30 and at 10:00.

     - The three participants are distinct people.

   - Effects (what this action enacts):
     - The time slots 9:30 and 10:00 are marked as scheduled.
     - The slots 9:30 and 10:00 are no longer available.
     - Arthur, Michael, and Samantha are no longer free at 9:30 and 10:00.

Result: The meeting is scheduled at 9:30–10:30 on Monday, satisfying the goal that those time slots become scheduled for everyone.
