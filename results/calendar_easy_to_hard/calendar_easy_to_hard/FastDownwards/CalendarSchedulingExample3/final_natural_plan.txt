Step 1 — schedule(arthur, arthur, arthur, s0930, s1000)
- Action performed: Schedule a 1-hour meeting using the consecutive slots s0930 and s1000.
- Timestamp / duration: Starts at 09:30 and covers two half-hour slots (09:30–10:00 and 10:00–10:30), so the meeting runs 09:30–10:30 on Monday.
- Parameters (as in the plan): p1 = Arthur, p2 = Arthur, p3 = Arthur (these are the three person parameters supplied in the plan).
- Effects / outcome: The meeting is marked as scheduled (meeting-scheduled) and slot s0930 is recorded as the start slot (scheduled s0930).
- Confirmation vs. specification: This sets the meeting at 09:30 on Monday (satisfies the goal scheduled s0930). All three participants (Arthur, Michael, Samantha) are available at s0930 and s1000 in the problem’s initial facts, so the chosen time fits everyone.
