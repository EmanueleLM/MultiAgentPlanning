PROBLEM
------------------------------
You are an expert at scheduling meetings. You are given a few constraints on the existing schedule of each participant, the meeting duration, and possibly some preferences on the meeting time. Note there exists a solution that works with existing schedule of every participant. Here are a few example tasks and solutions:

TASK: You need to schedule a meeting for Peter, Judith, Keith and Evelyn for half an hour between the work hours of 9:00 to 17:00 on Monday. 

Here are the existing schedules for everyone during the day: 
Peter has meetings on Monday during 9:00 to 9:30, 10:30 to 11:00, 11:30 to 12:00, 12:30 to 13:00; 
Judith's calendar is wide open the entire day.
Keith has blocked their calendar on Monday during 11:30 to 12:00, 12:30 to 15:00, 15:30 to 16:00, 16:30 to 17:00; 
Evelyn is busy on Monday during 9:00 to 12:30, 13:30 to 15:30, 16:30 to 17:00; 

Find a time that works for everyone's schedule and constraints.

NATURAL-PLAN sas_plan_6
------------------------------
1) Propose timeslot ts15 — Orchestrator proposes a 30-minute meeting on Monday at 16:00–16:30 (ts15).

2) Confirm (evelyn, ts15) — Evelyn confirms she is available for 16:00–16:30 on Monday.

3) Finalize ts15 (using evelyn’s confirmation) — Orchestrator finalizes and schedules the meeting for Monday 16:00–16:30 (30 minutes, ts15) for all participants (peter, judith, keith, evelyn). The meeting is now scheduled and satisfies the goal of placing a single 30-minute meeting on Monday between 09:00 and 17:00.

PROBLEM
------------------------------
You are an expert at scheduling meetings. You are given a few constraints on the existing schedule of each participant, the meeting duration, and possibly some preferences on the meeting time. Note there exists a solution that works with existing schedule of every participant. Here are a few example tasks and solutions:

TASK: You need to schedule a meeting for Lawrence, Christine, Barbara, Stephanie and Hannah for half an hour between the work hours of 9:00 to 17:00 on Monday. 

Here are the existing schedules for everyone during the day: 
Lawrencehas no meetings the whole day.
Christine has meetings on Monday during 9:00 to 9:30, 12:30 to 13:00; 
Barbara is busy on Monday during 10:30 to 11:30, 12:00 to 12:30, 13:00 to 13:30, 14:00 to 14:30, 15:30 to 16:00; 
Stephanie has meetings on Monday during 10:00 to 11:00, 11:30 to 12:00, 12:30 to 13:30, 14:30 to 15:00, 15:30 to 16:00, 16:30 to 17:00; 
Hannah has blocked their calendar on Monday during 9:00 to 10:00, 10:30 to 12:00, 12:30 to 13:00, 14:00 to 15:30, 16:00 to 16:30; 

Find a time that works for everyone's schedule and constraints.

PROBLEM
------------------------------
You are an expert at scheduling meetings. You are given a few constraints on the existing schedule of each participant, the meeting duration, and possibly some preferences on the meeting time. Note there exists a solution that works with existing schedule of every participant. Here are a few example tasks and solutions:

TASK: You need to schedule a meeting for Walter, Danielle, Julia, Samuel and Lori for half an hour between the work hours of 9:00 to 17:00 on Monday. 

Here are the existing schedules for everyone during the day: 
Walter's calendar is wide open the entire day.
Danielle is free the entire day.
Julia has blocked their calendar on Monday during 9:30 to 10:00, 10:30 to 11:00, 13:30 to 14:00, 16:00 to 16:30; 
Samuel has meetings on Monday during 9:00 to 11:00, 11:30 to 12:30, 13:00 to 14:30, 15:00 to 15:30, 16:00 to 17:00; 
Lori is busy on Monday during 10:00 to 10:30, 11:00 to 11:30, 12:00 to 12:30, 13:00 to 14:30, 15:00 to 17:00; 

You would like to schedule the meeting at their earlist availability.
Find a time that works for everyone's schedule and constraints.

TASK: You need to schedule a meeting for Walter, Danielle, Julia, Samuel and Lori for half an hour between the work hours of 9:00 to 17:00 on Monday. 

Here are the existing schedules for everyone during the day: 
Walter's calendar is wide open the entire day.
Danielle is free the entire day.
Julia has blocked their calendar on Monday during 9:30 to 10:00, 10:30 to 11:00, 13:30 to 14:00, 16:00 to 16:30; 
Samuel has meetings on Monday during 9:00 to 11:00, 11:30 to 12:30, 13:00 to 14:30, 15:00 to 15:30, 16:00 to 17:00; 
Lori is busy on Monday during 10:00 to 10:30, 11:00 to 11:30, 12:00 to 12:30, 13:00 to 14:30, 15:00 to 17:00; 

You would like to schedule the meeting at their earlist availability.
Find a time that works for everyone's schedule and constraints.

PROBLEM
------------------------------
You are an expert at scheduling meetings. You are given a few constraints on the existing schedule of each participant, the meeting duration, and possibly some preferences on the meeting time. Note there exists a solution that works with existing schedule of every participant. Here are a few example tasks and solutions:

TASK: You need to schedule a meeting for Jesse, Nancy, Isabella, Harold and Linda for half an hour between the work hours of 9:00 to 17:00 on Monday. 

Here are the existing schedules for everyone during the day: 
Jesse is busy on Monday during 10:00 to 10:30, 15:00 to 15:30; 
Nancy has blocked their calendar on Monday during 9:00 to 9:30, 10:30 to 11:00, 13:30 to 14:00, 14:30 to 15:00; 
Isabella has meetings on Monday during 9:00 to 10:00, 11:30 to 12:00, 15:30 to 16:00; 
Harold has blocked their calendar on Monday during 9:00 to 10:00, 10:30 to 16:30; 
Linda has meetings on Monday during 9:00 to 10:00, 12:00 to 12:30, 13:30 to 16:00; 

Find a time that works for everyone's schedule and constraints.

NATURAL-PLAN sas_plan_1
------------------------------
Step 1 — Schedule meeting (slot s1630)
- Action: Schedule a 30-minute meeting on Monday at 16:30–17:00 (slot s1630).
- Attendees: Jesse, Nancy, Isabella, Harold, Linda.
- Duration: 30 minutes (16:30 to 17:00).
- Result: The meeting is scheduled for that slot and that slot is now reserved for all five required attendees (their s1630 availability is consumed).
================================================================================


PROBLEM
------------------------------
You are an expert at scheduling meetings. You are given a few constraints on the existing schedule of each participant, the meeting duration, and possibly some preferences on the meeting time. Note there exists a solution that works with existing schedule of every participant. Here are a few example tasks and solutions:

TASK: You need to schedule a meeting for Michael, Samuel, Aaron, Judith and Kevin for half an hour between the work hours of 9:00 to 17:00 on Monday. 

Here are the existing schedules for everyone during the day: 
Michael is busy on Monday during 10:30 to 11:00, 14:30 to 15:00; 
Samuel is busy on Monday during 10:30 to 11:00, 12:30 to 13:00, 13:30 to 14:30, 15:30 to 16:00, 16:30 to 17:00; 
Aaron has blocked their calendar on Monday during 11:00 to 11:30, 12:30 to 13:00, 13:30 to 14:00, 15:00 to 15:30, 16:00 to 17:00; 
Judith is busy on Monday during 9:00 to 9:30, 10:30 to 11:30, 12:00 to 12:30, 14:00 to 15:00, 15:30 to 16:00, 16:30 to 17:00; 
Kevin is busy on Monday during 9:00 to 11:00, 11:30 to 13:00, 13:30 to 14:00, 14:30 to 15:00, 15:30 to 16:00; 

Find a time that works for everyone's schedule and constraints.

NATURAL-PLAN sas_plan_0
------------------------------
Step 1 — Schedule meeting at 13:00 (1:00 PM) on Monday for 30 minutes (ends 13:30).
- Action performed: schedule t1300
- Meeting start time: 13:00 (Monday)
- Meeting end time: 13:30 (Monday)
- Participants included: michael, samuel, aaron, judith, kevin
- Result: meeting is scheduled (meeting-start t1300) and the 30-minute meeting fits every participant's reported availability.
================================================================================


PROBLEM
------------------------------
You are an expert at scheduling meetings. You are given a few constraints on the existing schedule of each participant, the meeting duration, and possibly some preferences on the meeting time. Note there exists a solution that works with existing schedule of every participant. Here are a few example tasks and solutions:

TASK: You need to schedule a meeting for Eric, Jeremy, Joe, Brian, Brittany and Julia for half an hour between the work hours of 9:00 to 17:00 on Monday. 

Here are the existing schedules for everyone during the day: 
Eric is busy on Monday during 10:00 to 10:30, 12:30 to 13:00; 
Jeremy is busy on Monday during 11:00 to 12:00, 12:30 to 13:00, 15:00 to 15:30; 
Joe is free the entire day.
Brian has meetings on Monday during 9:00 to 10:30, 11:00 to 13:00, 13:30 to 14:00, 14:30 to 16:00, 16:30 to 17:00; 
Brittany is busy on Monday during 9:00 to 9:30, 10:30 to 12:00, 13:30 to 14:30, 15:00 to 15:30, 16:30 to 17:00; 
Julia has meetings on Monday during 9:00 to 11:00, 12:30 to 13:00, 13:30 to 15:00, 16:00 to 17:00; 

Find a time that works for everyone's schedule and constraints.

================================================================================


FINAL-PLAN
------------------------------
I don't yet have participant availability reports — I cannot invent busy intervals. Please provide the structured availability reports for each participant (see the required format below). Once you supply them I will produce a fully grounded PDDL problem (with busy intervals encoded and earliest feasible 30‑minute slot prioritized) together with the domain.

Below are:
- A reusable PDDL domain (FastDownward-compatible) wrapped in <domain>...</domain>.
- A PDDL problem template (placeholders and instructions) wrapped in <problem>...</problem> that I will fill once you supply the participant reports.

Provide availability in the exact structured format shown after the templates.

<domain>
(define (domain schedule-meeting)
  (:requirements :typing :negative-preconditions :fluents :numeric-fluents)
  (:types slot person)

  (:predicates
    (slot ?s - slot)
    (person ?p - person)
    ; busy ?p ?s means participant p is unavailable at slot s
    (busy ?p - person ?s - slot)
    ; available ?s means slot s is available for all participants (must be set in the problem)
    (available ?s - slot)
    (scheduled ?s - slot)
    (meeting-scheduled)
  )

  (:functions
    ; slot-cost is used to prefer earlier slots (lower = earlier)
    (slot-cost ?s - slot)
    (total-cost)
  )

  (:action schedule
    :parameters (?s - slot)
    :precondition (and
                    (slot ?s)

                    (not (meeting-scheduled))
                  )
    :effect (and
              (scheduled ?s)
              (meeting-scheduled)
              (increase (total-cost) (slot-cost ?s))
            )
  )
)

    (= (total-cost) 0)

    ; --- Participant declarations and busy facts go here ---
    ; Add a (person <name>) fact for each participant, e.g.
    ; (person alice)
    ; (person bob)
    ;
    ; For each participant and each slot during which they are unavailable, add:
    ; (busy <name> sHHMM)
    ;
    ; IMPORTANT: Do NOT invent busy facts. Use exactly the busy intervals you provide.
    ;
    ; After you provide busy facts, add (available sXXXX) for each slot that is free for ALL participants.
    ; That is: a slot s is available iff for every declared participant p there is NO (busy p s).
    ;
    ; Example (do NOT include unless you mean them):
    ; (person alice)
    ; (person bob)
    ; (busy alice s0900)
    ; (busy bob s0930)
    ; ; If s1000 is free for everyone, include:
    ; (available s1000)
    ;
    ; If you prefer, you can provide only person + busy facts and I will generate the final PDDL
    ; with computed (available ...) entries for you (tell me to "compute available slots").
  )

  ; Goal: schedule exactly one 30-minute meeting during Monday 09:00-17:00 (modeled by one schedule action)
  (:goal (meeting-scheduled))

  ; Minimize total-cost so the planner prefers the earliest feasible slot.
  (:metric minimize (total-cost))
)
</problem>

Required input format (please supply one line per participant):
- Use participant identifier (single token) and a list of busy half-hour slots (slot names must be within 09:00–16:30 starts).
- Example participants/busy intervals (you may use real times and I will map them to slot names):
  - alice: 09:00-10:30, 14:00-15:30
  - bob: 11:00-11:30
  - carol: (no busy intervals)

Exact structured example you can paste in your reply (preferred):
- alice | 09:00-10:30, 14:00-15:30
- bob   | 11:00-11:30
- carol | 

Notes on interpretation:
- Busy intervals align to 30-minute halves. For example 09:00-10:30 means busy at slots s0900, s0930, s1000.
- The meeting is exactly 30 minutes. A slot sHHMM represents a meeting starting at that time and occupying only that half-hour.
- I will convert your input into (person ...) and (busy ...) facts, compute which slots have no busy facts for any participant, add (available ...) for those slots, and return the fully grounded PDDL problem (with earliest preference encoded as shown).
- If you want me to compute available slots automatically, include the participant reports and say "compute available slots" — I'll return a ready-to-run problem for FastDownward.

Please paste the participant availability reports now (use the exact format shown) and indicate whether you want me to compute available slots.

NATURAL-PLAN sas_plan_1
------------------------------
Step 1 — Schedule meeting (maps to PDDL action: schedule t8)
- When: Monday, 13:00–13:30 (30 minutes)
- Who: eric, jeremy, joe, brian, brittany, julia
- Reason: all participants are free for the entire 13:00–13:30 slot, within the 09:00–17:00 work window
- Result: a single 30-minute meeting is scheduled at 13:00–13:30 on Monday (goal achieved).
================================================================================


PROBLEM
------------------------------
You are an expert at scheduling meetings. You are given a few constraints on the existing schedule of each participant, the meeting duration, and possibly some preferences on the meeting time. Note there exists a solution that works with existing schedule of every participant. Here are a few example tasks and solutions:

TASK: You need to schedule a meeting for Amy, Jonathan, Brittany, Matthew, Catherine and Carl for half an hour between the work hours of 9:00 to 17:00 on Monday. 

Here are the existing schedules for everyone during the day: 
Amy has blocked their calendar on Monday during 13:00 to 13:30, 15:30 to 16:00; 
Jonathan is busy on Monday during 9:00 to 9:30, 10:00 to 10:30, 11:30 to 12:00, 12:30 to 13:00; 
Brittany is busy on Monday during 9:30 to 10:00, 16:30 to 17:00; 
Matthew has meetings on Monday during 9:00 to 10:00, 12:30 to 14:30, 15:00 to 15:30, 16:00 to 16:30; 
Catherine has blocked their calendar on Monday during 9:00 to 10:30, 12:00 to 14:00, 16:30 to 17:00; 
Carl has blocked their calendar on Monday during 10:00 to 11:00, 11:30 to 12:30, 13:00 to 14:00, 14:30 to 16:30; 

Find a time that works for everyone's schedule and constraints.

SOLUTION: 
================================================================================


FINAL-PLAN
------------------------------
I can't produce a complete, correct problem file yet because you didn't supply the participants' machine-readable availability outputs. I must not invent availability data. Please provide each participant's availability for Monday in 30-minute granularity between 09:00 and 17:00 (for example as a list of available slots per participant, e.g., JSON or a simple mapping). Once you provide those, I will (1) pick the earliest 30-minute slot that all participants are available and (2) produce a FastDownwards-compatible PDDL domain and problem (domain enclosed in <domain></domain> and problem enclosed in <problem></problem>), with distinct participant actions and exact encoded constraints.

To help you provide the availability in the form I need, here's:
- the exact format I expect (example)
- a reusable PDDL domain (generic) that I will use to create the final problem when you supply availabilities

1) Preferred machine-readable availability format (examples)
- JSON (preferred):
  {
    "participants": {
      "alice": ["09:00","09:30","10:00", ...],
      "bob":   ["09:30","10:00", ...],
      "carol": ["09:00","09:30","11:00", ...]
    }
  }
  Times must be one of the 30-minute slot start times between 09:00 and 16:30 inclusive (09:00, 09:30, 10:00, ..., 16:30).

- Or a simple mapping:
  alice: 09:00,09:30,10:00,...
  bob: 09:30,10:00,...
  carol: 09:00,09:30,11:00,...

Make sure to list only slots the participant is available for. Natural-language statements like "prefer earlier" will be treated as a hard constraint only if you mark them explicitly; otherwise I will not invent them.

2) Generic PDDL domain template
Below is a generic PDDL domain I will use for the task. It models participants, 30-minute timeslots, free/available relations, a single meeting to schedule, and attendance. When you provide availability data I will create concrete participant-specific actions (kept distinct) and a problem file that encodes the exact available slots and the planner goal (schedule the meeting at the earliest slot available to all participants).

<domain>
(define (domain meeting-scheduling)
  (:requirements :strips :typing)
  (:types participant timeslot)

  (:predicates
    (participant ?p - participant)
    (timeslot ?t - timeslot)
    (available ?p - participant ?t - timeslot) ; participant p is available at timeslot t
    (meeting-scheduled ?t - timeslot)           ; meeting is scheduled at timeslot t
    (attends ?p - participant ?t - timeslot)    ; participant p attends meeting at timeslot t
    (meeting-confirmed)                         ; meeting has been scheduled and everyone attends
  )

  ; Generic action for a single participant to attend a meeting at time t.
  ; When creating the concrete problem I will generate distinct action schemas/
  ; instances per participant to satisfy the requirement "keep actions for participants distinct".
  (:action attend
    :parameters (?p - participant ?t - timeslot)
    :precondition (and
      (participant ?p)
      (timeslot ?t)
      (available ?p ?t)
      (not (meeting-confirmed)) ; prevent re-attending after meeting is confirmed
    )
    :effect (and
      (attends ?p ?t)
    )
  )

  ; Action to finalize the meeting at time t: requires all participants to have attends ?t
  ; (The concrete problem will include a conjunction of attends predicates in the initial state
  ; or the planner goal will require all attends; alternatively we will create a finalize action
  ; that requires attends for every participant — the concrete problem generator will create
  ; a finalize action instance per timeslot that lists the required attends predicates.)
  (:action finalize-meeting
    :parameters (?t - timeslot)
    :precondition (and
      (timeslot ?t)
      ; specific attends(...) preconditions will be added per-problem to require all participants
      (not (meeting-confirmed))
    )
    :effect (and
      (meeting-scheduled ?t)
      (meeting-confirmed)
    )
  )
)
</domain>

Notes about the domain above:
- It is intentionally generic. For FastDownwards to find a single concrete meeting slot that all participants attend, the problem file must list participants, timeslots, available predicates, and must either:
  - include problem-level goal requiring attends for all participants at the same timeslot (one goal per participant for the chosen timeslot), or
  - include per-timeslot finalize-meeting actions with preconditions requiring attends for all participants at that timeslot. When I generate the concrete problem I will use the latter approach: I will create distinct "attend-<participant>-<t>" action instances (or keep the generic action but the planner will instantiate it), but to satisfy your "distinct actions for participants" requirement I will produce named action instances per participant in the problem's action set (as domain-grounded operators), or explicitly encode per-participant actions in the domain if you prefer.

What I need from you to finish:
- The list of participants and for each, the exact available slot start times between 09:00 and 16:30 (30-minute granularity) for Monday.
- If you want me to treat any natural-language preference (like "avoid 12:00") as a strict constraint, mark it explicitly.

Once you provide that availability mapping, I will:
- pick the earliest timeslot (09:00, 09:30, ...) that every participant has marked available,
- generate a concrete PDDL problem encoding the participants, timeslot objects, available predicates (only available ones), and create distinct per-participant actions and a finalize action so FastDownwards can find the meeting,
- return both the domain and the problem enclosed exactly in <domain></domain> and <problem></problem> tags.

If you prefer, paste the availability now and I will produce the full domain+problem immediately.

Here are a few example tasks and solutions:\n\nTASK: You need to schedule a meeting for Amy, Jonathan, Brittany, Matthew, Catherine and Carl for half an hour between the work hours of 9:00 to 17:00 on Monday. \n\nHere are the existing schedules for everyone during the day: \nAmy has blocked their calendar on Monday during 13:00 to 13:30, 15:30 to 16:00; \nJonathan is busy on Monday during 9:00 to 9:30, 10:00 to 10:30, 11:30 to 12:00, 12:30 to 13:00; \nBrittany is busy on Monday during 9:30 to 10:00, 16:30 to 17:00; \nMatthew has meetings on Monday during 9:00 to 10:00, 12:30 to 14:30, 15:00 to 15:30, 16:00 to 16:30; \nCatherine has blocked their calendar on Monday during 9:00 to 10:30, 12:00 to 14:00, 16:30 to 17:00; \nCarl has blocked their calendar on Monday during 10:00 to 11:00, 11:30 to 12:30, 13:00 to 14:00, 14:30 to 16:30; \n\nFind a time that works for everyone's schedule and constraints. \nSOLUTION: ",

PROBLEM
------------------------------
You are an expert at scheduling meetings. You are given a few constraints on the existing schedule of each participant, the meeting duration, and possibly some preferences on the meeting time. Note there exists a solution that works with existing schedule of every participant. Here are a few example tasks and solutions:

TASK: You need to schedule a meeting for Nicole, Christine, Anna, Terry, Julie and Abigail for half an hour between the work hours of 9:00 to 17:00 on Monday. 

Here are the existing schedules for everyone during the day: 
Nicole has meetings on Monday during 10:00 to 10:30, 14:30 to 15:00; 
Christine has blocked their calendar on Monday during 11:00 to 11:30, 12:30 to 13:00; 
Anna has meetings on Monday during 9:30 to 10:30, 11:00 to 11:30, 12:30 to 13:00, 15:30 to 16:00, 16:30 to 17:00; 
Terry has meetings on Monday during 9:30 to 11:30, 13:00 to 13:30, 14:00 to 15:30; 
Julie is busy on Monday during 10:00 to 12:00, 12:30 to 13:30, 14:00 to 15:00; 
Abigail has meetings on Monday during 9:00 to 10:00, 11:30 to 12:00, 12:30 to 14:00, 14:30 to 15:00, 16:30 to 17:00; 

Anna would rather not meet on Monday before 14:00. Find a time that works for everyone's schedule and constraints.

You are an expert at scheduling meetings. You are given a few constraints on the existing schedule of each participant, the meeting duration, and possibly some preferences on the meeting time. Note there exists a solution that works with existing schedule of every participant. Here are a few example tasks and solutions:

TASK: You need to schedule a meeting for Theresa, Alexander, Virginia, Lisa, Natalie and Victoria for half an hour between the work hours of 9:00 to 17:00 on Monday. 

Here are the existing schedules for everyone during the day: 
Theresa is busy on Monday during 9:30 to 10:30, 15:00 to 16:00; 
Alexander has meetings on Monday during 12:00 to 12:30, 13:30 to 14:00; 
Virginia is free the entire day.
Lisa has meetings on Monday during 10:30 to 12:30, 13:30 to 14:30, 16:00 to 17:00; 
Natalie has blocked their calendar on Monday during 9:00 to 9:30, 11:00 to 12:30, 13:30 to 15:30, 16:00 to 17:00; 
Victoria is busy on Monday during 9:30 to 10:30, 11:00 to 12:30, 13:30 to 14:30, 15:00 to 16:30; 

Find a time that works for everyone's schedule and constraints.

FINAL-PLAN
------------------------------
I can do that, but I don’t have the participants’ availability details in your message. I must not invent or assume availability beyond what you provide. Please supply each participant’s structured availability for Monday between 09:00 and 17:00 (in 30‑minute granularity or as intervals that can be split into 30‑minute slots). Once you provide those, I will:

- compute the intersection of 30‑minute free slots,
- pick the earliest valid 30‑minute slot,
- produce a PDDL domain and PDDL problem (FastDownwards compatible) that encodes participants, timeslots, availability constraints, and the chosen meeting time as the goal,
- return the domain between <domain></domain> and the problem between <problem></problem> tags.

Please provide availabilities in one of these example formats (pick one consistent style):

1) Per-participant explicit 30-minute slots:
theresa: 09:00-09:30, 10:00-10:30, 13:30-14:00, 15:00-15:30
alexander: 09:00-09:30, 09:30-10:00, 11:00-11:30, 13:30-14:00
...

2) Per-participant intervals (I will split into 30‑minute slots):
theresa: free 09:00-11:00, 13:30-16:00
alexander: free 09:00-10:30, 11:00-12:00, 13:00-15:00
...

Include all six participants: theresa, alexander, virginia, lisa, natalie, victoria. If there are any hard constraints (e.g., someone must not be scheduled at a particular time) state them explicitly.

Send the availabilities and I’ll produce the computed slot and the PDDL domain/problem.

NATURAL-PLAN sas_plan_1
------------------------------
Step 1 — Schedule meeting at s1230 (Monday 12:30–13:00, duration 30 minutes)
- Action: Book the 30-minute meeting starting at 12:30 on Monday (slot s1230 → 12:30–13:00).
- Participants: theresa, alexander, virginia, lisa, natalie, victoria.
- Rationale: All participants are available for the entire 12:30–13:00 slot; the meeting is within work hours (09:00–17:00) and meets the required 30-minute duration.
- Effect: The slot 12:30–13:00 is marked as meeting time and is no longer available for other bookings.
================================================================================


PROBLEM
------------------------------
You are an expert at scheduling meetings. You are given a few constraints on the existing schedule of each participant, the meeting duration, and possibly some preferences on the meeting time. Note there exists a solution that works with existing schedule of every participant. Here are a few example tasks and solutions:

TASK: You need to schedule a meeting for Christine, Janice, Bobby, Elizabeth, Tyler and Edward for half an hour between the work hours of 9:00 to 17:00 on Monday. 

Here are the existing schedules for everyone during the day: 
Christine is busy on Monday during 9:30 to 10:30, 12:00 to 12:30, 13:00 to 13:30, 14:30 to 15:00, 16:00 to 16:30; 
Janice's calendar is wide open the entire day.
Bobby is busy on Monday during 12:00 to 12:30, 14:30 to 15:00; 
Elizabeth is busy on Monday during 9:00 to 9:30, 11:30 to 13:00, 13:30 to 14:00, 15:00 to 15:30, 16:00 to 17:00; 
Tyler is busy on Monday during 9:00 to 11:00, 12:00 to 12:30, 13:00 to 13:30, 15:30 to 16:00, 16:30 to 17:00; 
Edward is busy on Monday during 9:00 to 9:30, 10:00 to 11:00, 11:30 to 14:00, 14:30 to 15:30, 16:00 to 17:00; 

Janice would rather not meet on Monday after 13:00. Find a time that works for everyone's schedule and constraints.

PROBLEM
------------------------------
You are an expert at scheduling meetings. You are given a few constraints on the existing schedule of each participant, the meeting duration, and possibly some preferences on the meeting time. Note there exists a solution that works with existing schedule of every participant. Here are a few example tasks and solutions:

TASK: You need to schedule a meeting for Diane, Helen, Arthur, Ethan, Beverly and Deborah for half an hour between the work hours of 9:00 to 17:00 on Monday. 

Here are the existing schedules for everyone during the day: 
Diane's calendar is wide open the entire day.
Helenhas no meetings the whole day.
Arthurhas no meetings the whole day.
Ethan has meetings on Monday during 9:00 to 9:30, 10:00 to 10:30, 11:00 to 12:30, 13:30 to 15:00; 
Beverly is busy on Monday during 9:00 to 10:00, 10:30 to 11:00, 11:30 to 12:30, 13:30 to 15:30, 16:30 to 17:00; 
Deborah is busy on Monday during 9:00 to 11:00, 12:30 to 13:00, 13:30 to 14:30, 15:00 to 15:30, 16:00 to 17:00; 

Diane would like to avoid more meetings on Monday after 15:30. Find a time that works for everyone's schedule and constraints.

NATURAL-PLAN sas_plan_2
------------------------------
1) Schedule meeting at 13:00 on Monday — duration 30 minutes (13:00–13:30).
   - Participants: Diane, Helen, Arthur, Ethan, Beverly, Deborah.
   - Rationale: All participants are available at 13:00 and the meeting is within work hours (09:00–17:00). Diane’s preference to avoid meetings after 15:30 is respected.
   - Outcome: Meeting scheduled for Monday 13:00–13:30 (goal achieved).
================================================================================


PROBLEM
------------------------------
You are an expert at scheduling meetings. You are given a few constraints on the existing schedule of each participant, the meeting duration, and possibly some preferences on the meeting time. Note there exists a solution that works with existing schedule of every participant. Here are a few example tasks and solutions:

TASK: You need to schedule a meeting for Donald, Zachary, Kathryn, Deborah, Teresa and James for half an hour between the work hours of 9:00 to 17:00 on Monday. 

Here are the existing schedules for everyone during the day: 
Donald has meetings on Monday during 9:30 to 10:00, 11:00 to 12:30, 14:30 to 15:00, 16:30 to 17:00; 
Zachary has blocked their calendar on Monday during 9:00 to 9:30, 10:30 to 11:30, 12:00 to 12:30, 13:00 to 14:00; 
Kathryn's calendar is wide open the entire day.
Deborah is busy on Monday during 9:00 to 9:30, 10:00 to 10:30, 11:30 to 12:00, 13:00 to 13:30, 14:00 to 17:00; 
Teresa has meetings on Monday during 9:00 to 9:30, 10:00 to 11:00, 11:30 to 12:30, 14:00 to 14:30, 15:00 to 16:00; 
James is busy on Monday during 9:30 to 10:30, 11:00 to 12:30, 13:00 to 14:00, 14:30 to 17:00; 

Find a time that works for everyone's schedule and constraints.

FINAL-PLAN
------------------------------
I don't have the actual start-time lists for each participant in the form "HH:MM" (the inputs you provided named the lists but did not include their contents). I therefore produce a FastDownward-compatible PDDL domain and a corresponding problem file as a template that:

- Encodes times at 30-minute granularity from Monday 09:00 to 16:30 (these are the valid work-hour start times).
- Models each participant separately (donald, zachary, kathryn, deborah, teresa, james).
- Requires that a chosen start time be a work-slot and that every participant be available at that time (these availability facts must be filled in from your availability lists).
- Uses a numeric function time-index and minimizes total-cost so the planner will select the earliest feasible time (earliest = lowest time-index).

Please paste the actual availability facts (per participant, expressed as (available <participant> <time-object>)) into the indicated placeholders in the problem file. Once you supply those facts, FastDownward can find the earliest common 30-minute start time.

</problem>

Notes and next steps
- Please provide the exact availability entries for each of the six lists in HH:MM 30-minute start format. I will replace the placeholder section with the exact facts and return the filled problem PDDL that FastDownward can run immediately.
- The template prefers the earliest meeting start by minimizing the numeric time-index (1 = 09:00, 2 = 09:30, ..., 16 = 16:30). If two times have equal index (they won't under this encoding) the solver ties break arbitrarily.
- If you want the solver to return all feasible times instead of just the earliest, or to impose additional constraints (e.g., avoid lunch 12:00-13:00), tell me and I will modify the domain/problem accordingly.

PROBLEM
------------------------------
You are an expert at scheduling meetings. You are given a few constraints on the existing schedule of each participant, the meeting duration, and possibly some preferences on the meeting time. Note there exists a solution that works with existing schedule of every participant. Here are a few example tasks and solutions:

TASK: You need to schedule a meeting for Ronald, Stephen, Brittany, Dorothy, Rebecca and Jordan for half an hour between the work hours of 9:00 to 17:00 on Monday. 

Here are the existing schedules for everyone during the day: 
Ronald's calendar is wide open the entire day.
Stephen has blocked their calendar on Monday during 10:00 to 10:30, 12:00 to 12:30; 
Brittany has blocked their calendar on Monday during 11:00 to 11:30, 13:30 to 14:00, 15:30 to 16:00, 16:30 to 17:00; 
Dorothy has blocked their calendar on Monday during 9:00 to 9:30, 10:00 to 10:30, 11:00 to 12:30, 13:00 to 15:00, 15:30 to 17:00; 
Rebecca has meetings on Monday during 9:30 to 10:30, 11:00 to 11:30, 12:00 to 12:30, 13:00 to 17:00; 
Jordan is busy on Monday during 9:00 to 9:30, 10:00 to 11:00, 11:30 to 12:00, 13:00 to 15:00, 15:30 to 16:30; 

Find a time that works for everyone's schedule and constraints.

Find a time that works for everyone's schedule and constraints. 
SOLUTION: 
================================================================================


FINAL-PLAN
------------------------------
I don't have any participant availabilities yet. I can't invent them, and I must encode every availability as hard constraints. Please provide each participant's Monday availability (between 09:00 and 17:00) so I can generate the PDDL.

Preferred input format (examples you can paste or edit):
- Alice: 09:00-11:30, 13:00-17:00
- Bob: 10:30-12:00, 14:00-16:30
- Carol: 09:30-10:00, 15:00-17:00

Notes:
- I will discretize time into 30-minute start slots: 09:00, 09:30, 10:00, ..., 16:30 (meeting is 30 minutes).
- Natural-language preferences like "avoid X" or "would rather Y" will be treated as hard constraints (i.e., unavailable).
- By default I will assume the meeting must include all listed participants. If some participants are optional, say which are optional.
- If you need a required room or other resources, list them and their availabilities the same way.
- If you want a specific timezone or different day, state it now.

Provide the participant availabilities (and any required room/resource constraints), and I'll produce the Fast Downward–compatible PDDL domain and problem enclosed in <domain>...</domain> and <problem>...</problem> tags, with a metric to pick the earliest feasible start.

Here are a few example tasks and solutions:\n\nTASK: You need to schedule a meeting for Ronald, Stephen, Brittany, Dorothy, Rebecca and Jordan for half an hour between the work hours of 9:00 to 17:00 on Monday. \n\nHere are the existing schedules for everyone during the day: \nRonald's calendar is wide open the entire day.\nStephen has blocked their calendar on Monday during 10:00 to 10:30, 12:00 to 12:30; \nBrittany has blocked their calendar on Monday during 11:00 to 11:30, 13:30 to 14:00, 15:30 to 16:00, 16:30 to 17:00; \nDorothy has blocked their calendar on Monday during 9:00 to 9:30, 10:00 to 10:30, 11:00 to 12:30, 13:00 to 15:00, 15:30 to 17:00; \nRebecca has meetings on Monday during 9:30 to 10:30, 11:00 to 11:30, 12:00 to 12:30, 13:00 to 17:00; \nJordan is busy on Monday during 9:00 to 9:30, 10:00 to 11:00, 11:30 to 12:00, 13:00 to 15:00, 15:30 to 16:30; \n\nFind a time that works for everyone's schedule and constraints. \nSOLUTION: ",
