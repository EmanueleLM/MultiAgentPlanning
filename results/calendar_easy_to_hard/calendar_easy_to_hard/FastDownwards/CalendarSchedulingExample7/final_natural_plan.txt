1) fail-heather t0900 -> t0930  
   - Check slot 09:00–09:30. Heather is busy in this slot, so this slot is rejected and we advance to the next slot (09:30–10:00).

2) fail-zachary t0930 -> t1000  
   - Check slot 09:30–10:00. Zachary is busy in this slot, so this slot is rejected and we advance to the next slot (10:00–10:30).

3) fail-zachary t1000 -> t1030  
   - Check slot 10:00–10:30. Zachary is busy in this slot, so this slot is rejected and we advance to the next slot (10:30–11:00).

4) fail-heather t1030 -> t1100  
   - Check slot 10:30–11:00. Heather is busy in this slot, so this slot is rejected and we advance to the next slot (11:00–11:30).

5) fail-zachary t1100 -> t1130  
   - Check slot 11:00–11:30. Zachary is busy in this slot, so this slot is rejected and we advance to the next slot (11:30–12:00).

6) fail-zachary t1130 -> t1200  
   - Check slot 11:30–12:00. Zachary is busy in this slot, so this slot is rejected and we advance to the next slot (12:00–12:30).

7) schedule-preferred t1200  
   - Check and schedule slot 12:00–12:30. No participant (Heather, Nicholas, or Zachary) is busy in this slot and it is not marked undesirable, so the 30‑minute meeting is scheduled at 12:00–12:30 on Monday.

Result: A 30-minute meeting is scheduled on Monday from 12:00 to 12:30, which fits all participants' hard constraints and respects Zachary's preference to avoid meetings after 14:00. (Plan cost = 7)
