Step 1 — Billy schedules the meeting (action: billy-schedule-meeting t3 t4)
- Who: Billy executes the scheduling action.
- Slots used: t3 and t4 (consecutive 30‑minute slots).
- Time span: start = 10:30, end = 11:30 on Monday (t3 = 10:30–11:00, t4 = 11:00–11:30). Duration = 60 minutes.
- Preconditions satisfied (checked): both slots are within work hours; t3 and t4 are not marked busy for Billy; Maria is free at t3 and t4; William is available at t3 and t4; no meeting was previously scheduled.
- Effects (resulting state):
  - Meeting is scheduled (global flag set).
  - Meeting start recorded at t3 (scheduled-at t3).
  - Billy’s calendar: t3 and t4 are now occupied for Billy.
  - Maria’s calendar: t3 and t4 are no longer free for Maria.
  - William’s calendar: t3 and t4 are no longer available for William.

Outcome: A one‑hour meeting is scheduled on Monday from 10:30 to 11:30 that fits Billy’s, Maria’s and William’s calendars (global goal achieved).
