Plan (steps correspond exactly to the PDDL plan):

1) (schedule_michael m1 s9_30 s10_00)
   - Action: Michael schedules meeting "m1" to start at 09:30.
   - Time covered: 09:30 — 10:30 (two consecutive 30-min slots: s9_30 and s10_00 → 1 hour).
   - Effect: meeting m1 is marked as scheduled for Michael at start 09:30; both 09:30 and 10:00 slots for the meeting are considered for the meeting duration.

2) (schedule_generic s9_30 s10_00)
   - Action: Global/scheduling agent marks the slots as taken and declares the meeting globally scheduled.
   - Time covered: 09:30 — 10:30 (s9_30 and s10_00).
   - Effect: the two slots are removed from the pool of free slots, a global "scheduled" marker is set, and the meeting start is recorded at 09:30.

3) (schedule_arthur arthur s9_30 s10_00)
   - Action: Arthur's calendar is updated to reserve the same two slots for the meeting.
   - Time covered: 09:30 — 10:30 (s9_30 and s10_00).
   - Effect: Arthur's availability for 09:30 and 10:00 is cleared and the meeting is recorded as scheduled for Arthur starting at 09:30.

Result: The meeting is scheduled on Monday from 09:30 to 10:30 (1 hour), satisfying Arthur’s, Michael’s, and Samantha’s constraints and the orchestrator’s goal.
