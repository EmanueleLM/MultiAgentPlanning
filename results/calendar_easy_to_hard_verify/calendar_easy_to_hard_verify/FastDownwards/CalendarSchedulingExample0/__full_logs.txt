PROBLEM
------------------------------
You are an expert at scheduling meetings. You are given a few constraints on the existing schedule of each participant, the meeting duration, and possibly some preferences on the meeting time. Note there exists a solution that works with existing schedule of every participant. Here are a few example tasks and solutions:

TASK: You need to schedule a meeting for Michelle, Steven and Jerry for one hour between the work hours of 9:00 to 17:00 on Monday. 

Here are the existing schedules for everyone during the day: 
Michelle has meetings on Monday during 11:00 to 12:00; 
Steven has blocked their calendar on Monday during 9:00 to 9:30, 11:30 to 12:00, 13:30 to 14:00, 15:30 to 16:00; 
Jerry has blocked their calendar on Monday during 9:00 to 9:30, 10:00 to 11:00, 11:30 to 12:30, 13:00 to 14:30, 15:30 to 16:00, 16:30 to 17:00; 

 Here is the proposed time: Monday, 14:30 - 15:30 Here is the proposed time: Monday, 14:30 - 15:30. Verify that the proposed time satisfies all the constraints or provide an alternative plan.

NATURAL-PLAN sas_plan_8
------------------------------
Step 1 — Schedule meeting starting at 09:00 (covers two 30‑minute slots: 09:00–09:30 and 09:30–10:00)
- Action taken (PDDL): (schedule s09_00 s09_30 michelle michelle michelle)
- Human-readable: Schedule a one‑hour meeting on Monday starting at 09:00. The meeting occupies 09:00–09:30 and 09:30–10:00.
- Attendee fields in the plan: michelle (assigned to all three person parameters in the action)
- Resulting state: the meeting is marked scheduled and the chosen meeting start time is 09:00.
- Plan cost: 1

No further steps. The plan completes the goal (scheduled) by selecting 09:00 as the meeting start.
