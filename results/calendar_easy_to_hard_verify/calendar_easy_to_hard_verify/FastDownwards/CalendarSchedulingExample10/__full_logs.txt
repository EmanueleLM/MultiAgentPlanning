PROBLEM
------------------------------
You are an expert at scheduling meetings. You are given a few constraints on the existing schedule of each participant, the meeting duration, and possibly some preferences on the meeting time. Note there exists a solution that works with existing schedule of every participant. Here are a few example tasks and solutions:

TASK: You need to schedule a meeting for Michelle, Steven and Jerry for one hour between the work hours of 9:00 to 17:00 on Monday. 

Here are the existing schedules for everyone during the day: 
Michelle has meetings on Monday during 11:00 to 12:00; 
Steven has blocked their calendar on Monday during 9:00 to 9:30, 11:30 to 12:00, 13:30 to 14:00, 15:30 to 16:00; 
Jerry has blocked their calendar on Monday during 9:00 to 9:30, 10:00 to 11:00, 11:30 to 12:30, 13:00 to 14:30, 15:30 to 16:00, 16:30 to 17:00; 

 Here is the proposed time: Monday, 14:30 - 15:30 Here is the proposed time: Monday, 14:30 - 15:30. Verify that the proposed time satisfies all the constraints or provide an alternative plan.

NATURAL-PLAN sas_plan_8
------------------------------
Step 1 — Schedule meeting starting at 09:00 (covers two 30‑minute slots: 09:00–09:30 and 09:30–10:00)
- Action taken (PDDL): (schedule s09_00 s09_30 michelle michelle michelle)
- Human-readable: Schedule a one‑hour meeting on Monday starting at 09:00. The meeting occupies 09:00–09:30 and 09:30–10:00.
- Attendee fields in the plan: michelle (assigned to all three person parameters in the action)
- Resulting state: the meeting is marked scheduled and the chosen meeting start time is 09:00.
- Plan cost: 1

No further steps. The plan completes the goal (scheduled) by selecting 09:00 as the meeting start.
================================================================================


PROBLEM
------------------------------
You are an expert at scheduling meetings. You are given a few constraints on the existing schedule of each participant, the meeting duration, and possibly some preferences on the meeting time. Note there exists a solution that works with existing schedule of every participant. Here are a few example tasks and solutions:

TASK: You need to schedule a meeting for Raymond, Billy and Donald for half an hour between the work hours of 9:00 to 17:00 on Monday. 

Here are the existing schedules for everyone during the day: 
Raymond has blocked their calendar on Monday during 9:00 to 9:30, 11:30 to 12:00, 13:00 to 13:30, 15:00 to 15:30; 
Billy has meetings on Monday during 10:00 to 10:30, 12:00 to 13:00, 16:30 to 17:00; 
Donald has meetings on Monday during 9:00 to 9:30, 10:00 to 11:00, 12:00 to 13:00, 14:00 to 14:30, 16:00 to 17:00; 

Billy would like to avoid more meetings on Monday after 15:00. Here is the proposed time: Monday, 14:30 - 15:00. Verify that the proposed time satisfies all the constraints or provide an alternative plan.

NATURAL-PLAN sas_plan_2
------------------------------
1) attend-billy s2 — Billy accepts/marks attendance for slot s2 (Monday 09:30–10:00, 30 minutes).

2) attend-donald s2 — Donald accepts/marks attendance for slot s2 (Monday 09:30–10:00, 30 minutes).

3) attend-raymond s2 — Raymond accepts/marks attendance for slot s2 (Monday 09:30–10:00, 30 minutes).

4) confirm s2 — Orchestrator/system confirms and schedules the meeting in slot s2 (Monday 09:30–10:00, 30 minutes).

Final outcome: A 30-minute meeting is scheduled on Monday from 09:30 to 10:00 for Raymond, Billy, and Donald.

PROBLEM
------------------------------
You are an expert at scheduling meetings. You are given a few constraints on the existing schedule of each participant, the meeting duration, and possibly some preferences on the meeting time. Note there exists a solution that works with existing schedule of every participant. Here are a few example tasks and solutions:

TASK: You need to schedule a meeting for Roy, Kathryn and Amy for half an hour between the work hours of 9:00 to 17:00 on Monday. 

Here are the existing schedules for everyone during the day: 
Roy has blocked their calendar on Monday during 9:00 to 9:30, 10:00 to 10:30, 11:00 to 11:30, 12:30 to 13:00; 
Kathryn has meetings on Monday during 9:30 to 10:00, 16:30 to 17:00; 
Amy has blocked their calendar on Monday during 9:00 to 14:30, 15:00 to 16:00, 16:30 to 17:00; 

Amy would rather not meet on Monday after 15:30. Here is the proposed time: Monday, 14:30 - 15:00. Verify that the proposed time satisfies all the constraints or provide an alternative plan.

NATURAL-PLAN sas_plan_2
------------------------------
Step 1 — schedule s1430:
- Action: Schedule a 30-minute meeting in slot s1430.
- Time: Monday 14:30–15:00 (duration 30 minutes).
- Participants: Roy, Kathryn, Amy.
- Outcome: The meeting is scheduled at 14:30–15:00 and that slot is selected for the meeting.
- Notes: This slot is available for all three participants and respects Amy’s preference (before 15:30).
- Plan cost: 1.

PROBLEM
------------------------------
You are an expert at scheduling meetings. You are given a few constraints on the existing schedule of each participant, the meeting duration, and possibly some preferences on the meeting time. Note there exists a solution that works with existing schedule of every participant. Here are a few example tasks and solutions:

TASK: You need to schedule a meeting for Arthur, Michael and Samantha for one hour between the work hours of 9:00 to 17:00 on Monday. 

Here are the existing schedules for everyone during the day: 
Arthur is busy on Monday during 9:00 to 9:30, 10:30 to 12:00, 16:00 to 17:00; 
Michael has meetings on Monday during 13:00 to 13:30, 14:00 to 14:30; 
Samantha has blocked their calendar on Monday during 10:30 to 11:00, 12:00 to 15:00, 15:30 to 17:00; 

 Here is the proposed time: Monday, 9:30 - 10:30. Verify that the proposed time satisfies all the constraints or provide an alternative plan.

FINAL-PLAN
------------------------------
availability_arthur:
- Busy intervals (Monday):
  - 09:00-09:30
  - 10:30-12:00
  - 16:00-17:00
- Hard constraints: meeting must not occupy any time overlapping these intervals.

availability_michael:
- Busy intervals (Monday):
  - 13:00-13:30
  - 14:00-14:30
- Hard constraints: meeting must not occupy any time overlapping these intervals.

availability_samantha:
- Busy intervals (Monday):
  - 10:30-11:00
  - 12:00-15:00
  - 15:30-17:00
- Hard constraints: meeting must not occupy any time overlapping these intervals.

Reasoning (brief):
- Time granularity: 30-minute slots from 09:00 to 16:30 (starts). A 60-minute meeting occupies two consecutive 30-minute slots. Valid start times are 09:00..16:00 (represented as slot start + next slot).
- Build candidate start times in chronological order and check both consecutive slots are free for all participants.
- Earliest feasible start that satisfies all hard constraints is 09:30 (occupying 09:30-10:00 and 10:00-10:30). All three participants are free at both 09:30 and 10:00 given their busy intervals.
- Therefore we encode the planning problem with the goal of scheduling the meeting at start t0930 (09:30-10:30) — this enforces the "prefer earliest feasible slot" requirement by making that the goal.

NATURAL-PLAN sas_plan_0
------------------------------
Plan (1 step)

1) Schedule the meeting (action: schedule t0930 t1000)
   - What to do: Schedule a 1-hour meeting on Monday for Arthur, Michael, and Samantha.
   - Time: start 09:30, end 10:30 (meeting duration = 60 minutes).
   - Calendar updates (effects): record the meeting and mark Arthur, Michael, and Samantha as unavailable during 09:30–10:30.
   - Outcome: The meeting is scheduled at the earliest feasible slot that satisfies all participants' constraints; the goal is achieved.
================================================================================


PROBLEM
------------------------------
You are an expert at scheduling meetings. You are given a few constraints on the existing schedule of each participant, the meeting duration, and possibly some preferences on the meeting time. Note there exists a solution that works with existing schedule of every participant. Here are a few example tasks and solutions:

TASK: You need to schedule a meeting for Donna, John and Billy for half an hour between the work hours of 9:00 to 17:00 on Monday. 

Here are the existing schedules for everyone during the day: 
Donna is busy on Monday during 14:00 to 14:30, 15:30 to 16:00; 
John is busy on Monday during 11:00 to 11:30, 16:30 to 17:00; 
Billy is busy on Monday during 9:00 to 10:00, 10:30 to 14:00, 14:30 to 17:00; 

 Here is the proposed time: Monday, 10:00 - 10:30. Verify that the proposed time satisfies all the constraints or provide an alternative plan.

NATURAL-PLAN sas_plan_4
------------------------------
Step 1 — Schedule slot s1000:
- Action: Schedule a 30-minute meeting.
- Time: Monday, 10:00–10:30 (slot s1000).
- Participants: donna, john, billy.
- Duration: 30 minutes.
- Result: Meeting is scheduled for that slot; s1000 is reserved and the three participants are no longer free at 10:00–10:30.
================================================================================


PROBLEM
------------------------------
You are an expert at scheduling meetings. You are given a few constraints on the existing schedule of each participant, the meeting duration, and possibly some preferences on the meeting time. Note there exists a solution that works with existing schedule of every participant. Here are a few example tasks and solutions:

TASK: You need to schedule a meeting for Kathryn, Charlotte and Lauren for half an hour between the work hours of 9:00 to 17:00 on Monday. 

Here are the existing schedules for everyone during the day: 
Kathryn has blocked their calendar on Monday during 9:00 to 9:30, 10:30 to 11:00, 11:30 to 12:00, 13:30 to 14:30, 16:30 to 17:00; 
Charlotte has blocked their calendar on Monday during 12:00 to 12:30, 16:00 to 16:30; 
Lauren has blocked their calendar on Monday during 9:00 to 10:00, 12:00 to 12:30, 13:30 to 14:30, 15:00 to 16:00, 16:30 to 17:00; 

Charlotte do not want to meet on Monday after 13:30. Here is the proposed time: Monday, 12:30 - 13:00. Verify that the proposed time satisfies all the constraints or provide an alternative plan.

Ensure the encoding represents time or slot granularity sufficient to model 30-minute durations and that constraints preventing meetings after Charlotte's cutoff are enforced."

Here are a few example tasks and solutions:\n\nTASK: You need to schedule a meeting for Kathryn, Charlotte and Lauren for half an hour between the work hours of 9:00 to 17:00 on Monday. \n\nHere are the existing schedules for everyone during the day: \nKathryn has blocked their calendar on Monday during 9:00 to 9:30, 10:30 to 11:00, 11:30 to 12:00, 13:30 to 14:30, 16:30 to 17:00; \nCharlotte has blocked their calendar on Monday during 12:00 to 12:30, 16:00 to 16:30; \nLauren has blocked their calendar on Monday during 9:00 to 10:00, 12:00 to 12:30, 13:30 to 14:30, 15:00 to 16:00, 16:30 to 17:00; \n\nCharlotte do not want to meet on Monday after 13:30. Here is the proposed time: Monday, 12:30 - 13:00. Verify that the proposed time satisfies all the constraints or provide an alternative plan.",

Here are a few example tasks and solutions:\n\nTASK: You need to schedule a meeting for Kathryn, Charlotte and Lauren for half an hour between the work hours of 9:00 to 17:00 on Monday. \n\nHere are the existing schedules for everyone during the day: \nKathryn has blocked their calendar on Monday during 9:00 to 9:30, 10:30 to 11:00, 11:30 to 12:00, 13:30 to 14:30, 16:30 to 17:00; \nCharlotte has blocked their calendar on Monday during 12:00 to 12:30, 16:00 to 16:30; \nLauren has blocked their calendar on Monday during 9:00 to 10:00, 12:00 to 12:30, 13:30 to 14:30, 15:00 to 16:00, 16:30 to 17:00; \n\nCharlotte do not want to meet on Monday after 13:30. Here is the proposed time: Monday, 12:30 - 13:00. Verify that the proposed time satisfies all the constraints or provide an alternative plan.",

NATURAL-PLAN sas_plan_4
------------------------------
Step 1 — action: schedule-s1000
- Schedule a 30-minute meeting on Monday starting at 10:00 and ending at 10:30.
- Participants: Kathryn, Charlotte, Lauren.
- Rationale: this start time fits all participants' availabilities and respects Charlotte’s preference (no meetings starting after 13:30).
- (Matches plan action "schedule-s1000"; plan cost = 2.)
================================================================================


PROBLEM
------------------------------
You are an expert at scheduling meetings. You are given a few constraints on the existing schedule of each participant, the meeting duration, and possibly some preferences on the meeting time. Note there exists a solution that works with existing schedule of every participant. Here are a few example tasks and solutions:

TASK: You need to schedule a meeting for Thomas, Dylan and Jerry for one hour between the work hours of 9:00 to 17:00 on Monday. 

Here are the existing schedules for everyone during the day: 
Thomas's calendar is wide open the entire day.
Dylan has blocked their calendar on Monday during 10:30 to 11:00, 13:30 to 14:00; 
Jerry is busy on Monday during 9:00 to 11:00, 11:30 to 14:30, 16:00 to 17:00; 

 Here is the proposed time: Monday, 14:30 - 15:30. Verify that the proposed time satisfies all the constraints or provide an alternative plan.

NATURAL-PLAN sas_plan_4
------------------------------
Step 1 — Action (as in the plan):
  schedule-meeting s11 s12 dylan dylan dylan

Human-readable interpretation:
  Schedule a 60-minute meeting on Monday from 14:30 to 15:30 (this uses slots s11 = 14:30–15:00 and s12 = 15:00–15:30).

Participants:
  Thomas, Dylan, Jerry (the chosen slot is compatible with each participant's calendar).

Why this satisfies the goal:
  - Meeting duration: 60 minutes (two consecutive 30-minute slots s11 and s12).
  - Thomas is free the whole work day (09:00–17:00).
  - Dylan is busy only 10:30–11:00 and 13:30–14:00, so 14:30–15:30 is free for Dylan.
  - Jerry is free at 14:30–15:30 (other busy intervals do not cover s11–s12).
  - Therefore the scheduled meeting (14:30–15:30) fits all participants and achieves the goal (meeting scheduled at slot s11).
================================================================================


PROBLEM
------------------------------
You are an expert at scheduling meetings. You are given a few constraints on the existing schedule of each participant, the meeting duration, and possibly some preferences on the meeting time. Note there exists a solution that works with existing schedule of every participant. Here are a few example tasks and solutions:

TASK: You need to schedule a meeting for Heather, Nicholas and Zachary for half an hour between the work hours of 9:00 to 17:00 on Monday. 

Here are the existing schedules for everyone during the day: 
Heather has blocked their calendar on Monday during 9:00 to 9:30, 10:30 to 11:00, 13:00 to 14:00, 14:30 to 15:00, 16:00 to 16:30; 
Nicholashas no meetings the whole day.
Zachary has blocked their calendar on Monday during 9:00 to 10:30, 11:00 to 12:00, 12:30 to 13:00, 13:30 to 16:30; 

Zachary would rather not meet on Monday after 14:00. Here is the proposed time: Monday, 12:00 - 12:30. Verify that the proposed time satisfies all the constraints or provide an alternative plan.

Here are a few example tasks and solutions:\n\nTASK: You need to schedule a meeting for Heather, Nicholas and Zachary for half an hour between the work hours of 9:00 to 17:00 on Monday. \n\nHere are the existing schedules for everyone during the day: \nHeather has blocked their calendar on Monday during 9:00 to 9:30, 10:30 to 11:00, 13:00 to 14:00, 14:30 to 15:00, 16:00 to 16:30; \nNicholashas no meetings the whole day.\nZachary has blocked their calendar on Monday during 9:00 to 10:30, 11:00 to 12:00, 12:30 to 13:00, 13:30 to 16:30; \n\nZachary would rather not meet on Monday after 14:00. Here is the proposed time: Monday, 12:00 - 12:30. Verify that the proposed time satisfies all the constraints or provide an alternative plan.",

NATURAL-PLAN sas_plan_8
------------------------------
Step 1 — Schedule meeting at 12:00 (30 minutes)
- Action: schedule-12-00
- When: Monday, 12:00 — 12:30 (30-minute meeting)
- Participants: heather, nicholas, zachary
- Rationale: all three are available for the 12:00–12:30 slot (fits work hours 09:00–17:00; respects Heather's and Nicholas's busy intervals and Zachary's preference to avoid times after 14:00).
- Planner cost: 7 (as returned by the solver)
================================================================================


PROBLEM
------------------------------
You are an expert at scheduling meetings. You are given a few constraints on the existing schedule of each participant, the meeting duration, and possibly some preferences on the meeting time. Note there exists a solution that works with existing schedule of every participant. Here are a few example tasks and solutions:

TASK: You need to schedule a meeting for Adam, Jerry and Matthew for half an hour between the work hours of 9:00 to 17:00 on Monday. 

Here are the existing schedules for everyone during the day: 
Adam has meetings on Monday during 10:00 to 10:30, 12:30 to 13:00, 13:30 to 14:30; 
Jerry has blocked their calendar on Monday during 9:00 to 9:30, 12:00 to 12:30, 15:00 to 16:00; 
Matthew has meetings on Monday during 9:30 to 11:00, 11:30 to 12:30, 13:00 to 14:00, 14:30 to 17:00; 

 Here is the proposed time: Monday, 11:00 - 11:30. Verify that the proposed time satisfies all the constraints or provide an alternative plan.

Here are a few example tasks and solutions:\n\nTASK: You need to schedule a meeting for Adam, Jerry and Matthew for half an hour between the work hours of 9:00 to 17:00 on Monday. \n\nHere are the existing schedules for everyone during the day: \nAdam has meetings on Monday during 10:00 to 10:30, 12:30 to 13:00, 13:30 to 14:30; \nJerry has blocked their calendar on Monday during 9:00 to 9:30, 12:00 to 12:30, 15:00 to 16:00; \nMatthew has meetings on Monday during 9:30 to 11:00, 11:30 to 12:30, 13:00 to 14:00, 14:30 to 17:00; \n\n Here is the proposed time: Monday, 11:00 - 11:30. Verify that the proposed time satisfies all the constraints or provide an alternative plan.",

NATURAL-PLAN sas_plan_3
------------------------------
Step 1 — schedule s1100
- Action: schedule
- Time slot: Monday 11:00–11:30 (30 minutes)
- Participants: adam, jerry, matthew
- Rationale: all three participants are free at the 11:00 slot, so the preconditions are satisfied.
- Result: the timeslot 11:00–11:30 is scheduled; meeting-scheduled goal achieved.
================================================================================


PROBLEM
------------------------------
You are an expert at scheduling meetings. You are given a few constraints on the existing schedule of each participant, the meeting duration, and possibly some preferences on the meeting time. Note there exists a solution that works with existing schedule of every participant. Here are a few example tasks and solutions:

TASK: You need to schedule a meeting for Diane, Kelly and Deborah for half an hour between the work hours of 9:00 to 17:00 on Monday. 

Here are the existing schedules for everyone during the day: 
Diane has meetings on Monday during 9:00 to 9:30, 12:00 to 12:30, 14:30 to 15:30; 
Kelly has meetings on Monday during 9:30 to 10:00, 10:30 to 11:00; 
Deborah is busy on Monday during 9:00 to 9:30, 10:00 to 14:00, 14:30 to 17:00; 

 Here is the proposed time: Monday, 14:00 - 14:30. Verify that the proposed time satisfies all the constraints or provide an alternative plan.

NATURAL-PLAN sas_plan_7
------------------------------
1) Execute action "schedule s1400":
   - Book a 30-minute meeting on Monday from 14:00 to 14:30.
   - Participants: Diane, Kelly, Deborah.
   - All three participants are available at 14:00, so the meeting is confirmed.
   - Outcome: meeting scheduled (meeting_at 14:00).
================================================================================


PROBLEM
------------------------------
You are an expert at scheduling meetings. You are given a few constraints on the existing schedule of each participant, the meeting duration, and possibly some preferences on the meeting time. Note there exists a solution that works with existing schedule of every participant. Here are a few example tasks and solutions:

TASK: You need to schedule a meeting for Denise, Joseph, Henry and Christian for one hour between the work hours of 9:00 to 17:00 on Monday. 

Here are the existing schedules for everyone during the day: 
Denise's calendar is wide open the entire day.
Josephhas no meetings the whole day.
Henry has meetings on Monday during 9:00 to 9:30, 10:00 to 10:30, 12:00 to 14:30, 15:00 to 16:00, 16:30 to 17:00; 
Christian is busy on Monday during 9:00 to 11:00, 14:30 to 15:30, 16:00 to 17:00; 

 Here is the proposed time: Monday, 11:00 - 12:00. Verify that the proposed time satisfies all the constraints or provide an alternative plan.
