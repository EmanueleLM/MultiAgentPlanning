Step 1 — Schedule the one-hour meeting:
- Action: select time slot starting at 10:00 (discrete points t1000 and t1030)
- Meeting time: Monday, 10:00–11:00 (covers 10:00–10:30 and 10:30–11:00)
- Participants: Olivia, Anna, Virginia, Paul
- Rationale: All four participants are free for both half-hour subslots, so the one-hour meeting can be held.
- Result: Meeting slot selected; goal achieved. (Plan cost = 1)
