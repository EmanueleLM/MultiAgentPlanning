Step 1 — Schedule the meeting:
- Action: Schedule a 30‑minute meeting.
- When: Monday, 10:30–11:00 (start 10:30, end 11:00).
- Participants: Alan, Michael, Michelle, Roy, Judy, Natalie, Brian.
- Note: All participants are available at the 10:30–11:00 slot (aligned to 30‑minute boundaries), so the meeting is successfully scheduled and the goal (a 30‑minute Monday meeting with all participants) is achieved.
