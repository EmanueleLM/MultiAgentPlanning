PROBLEM
------------------------------
You are an expert at scheduling meetings. You are given a few constraints on the existing schedule of each participant, the meeting duration, and possibly some preferences on the meeting time. Note there exists a solution that works with existing schedule of every participant.TASK: You need to schedule a meeting for Michelle, Steven and Jerry for one hour between the work hours of 9:00 to 17:00 on Monday. 

Here are the existing schedules for everyone during the day: 
Michelle has meetings on Monday during 11:00 to 12:00; 
Steven has blocked their calendar on Monday during 9:00 to 9:30, 11:30 to 12:00, 13:30 to 14:00, 15:30 to 16:00; 
Jerry has blocked their calendar on Monday during 9:00 to 9:30, 10:00 to 11:00, 11:30 to 12:30, 13:00 to 14:30, 15:30 to 16:00, 16:30 to 17:00; 

 Here is the proposed time: Monday, 14:30 - 15:30 Here is the proposed time: Monday, 14:30 - 15:30. Verify that the proposed time satisfies all the constraints or provide an alternative plan.

NATURAL-PLAN sas_plan_4
------------------------------
Step 1 — Schedule meeting (matches plan: (schedule t1430 t1500))
- Action: Schedule a one-hour meeting on Monday.
- Start time: 14:30 (t1430).
- End time: 15:30 (uses consecutive slots t1430 and t1500 → covers 14:30–15:30).
- Duration: 60 minutes.
- Participants: Michelle, Steven, Jerry.
- Note: This start time is within the 09:00–17:00 work window and was chosen because all three participants are free for the required consecutive half-hour slots that make up the one-hour meeting.
================================================================================


PROBLEM
------------------------------
You are an expert at scheduling meetings. You are given a few constraints on the existing schedule of each participant, the meeting duration, and possibly some preferences on the meeting time. Note there exists a solution that works with existing schedule of every participant.TASK: You need to schedule a meeting for Raymond, Billy and Donald for half an hour between the work hours of 9:00 to 17:00 on Monday. 

Here are the existing schedules for everyone during the day: 
Raymond has blocked their calendar on Monday during 9:00 to 9:30, 11:30 to 12:00, 13:00 to 13:30, 15:00 to 15:30; 
Billy has meetings on Monday during 10:00 to 10:30, 12:00 to 13:00, 16:30 to 17:00; 
Donald has meetings on Monday during 9:00 to 9:30, 10:00 to 11:00, 12:00 to 13:00, 14:00 to 14:30, 16:00 to 17:00; 

Billy would like to avoid more meetings on Monday after 15:00. Here is the proposed time: Monday, 14:30 - 15:00. Verify that the proposed time satisfies all the constraints or provide an alternative plan.

PROBLEM
------------------------------
You are an expert at scheduling meetings. You are given a few constraints on the existing schedule of each participant, the meeting duration, and possibly some preferences on the meeting time. Note there exists a solution that works with existing schedule of every participant.TASK: You need to schedule a meeting for Roy, Kathryn and Amy for half an hour between the work hours of 9:00 to 17:00 on Monday. 

Here are the existing schedules for everyone during the day: 
Roy has blocked their calendar on Monday during 9:00 to 9:30, 10:00 to 10:30, 11:00 to 11:30, 12:30 to 13:00; 
Kathryn has meetings on Monday during 9:30 to 10:00, 16:30 to 17:00; 
Amy has blocked their calendar on Monday during 9:00 to 14:30, 15:00 to 16:00, 16:30 to 17:00; 

Amy would rather not meet on Monday after 15:30. Here is the proposed time: Monday, 14:30 - 15:00. Verify that the proposed time satisfies all the constraints or provide an alternative plan.

NATURAL-PLAN sas_plan_2
------------------------------
Step 1 — Schedule the meeting (14:30–15:00, Monday)
- Action taken: schedule s1430_1500
- Result: A 30-minute meeting is selected and marked scheduled for Monday 14:30–15:00.
- Participants: Roy, Kathryn, Amy
- Why this slot: all three participants are available at 14:30–15:00, and the slot ends before 15:30, so Amy’s preference to avoid meeting after 15:30 is satisfied.
================================================================================


PROBLEM
------------------------------
You are an expert at scheduling meetings. You are given a few constraints on the existing schedule of each participant, the meeting duration, and possibly some preferences on the meeting time. Note there exists a solution that works with existing schedule of every participant.TASK: You need to schedule a meeting for Arthur, Michael and Samantha for one hour between the work hours of 9:00 to 17:00 on Monday. 

Here are the existing schedules for everyone during the day: 
Arthur is busy on Monday during 9:00 to 9:30, 10:30 to 12:00, 16:00 to 17:00; 
Michael has meetings on Monday during 13:00 to 13:30, 14:00 to 14:30; 
Samantha has blocked their calendar on Monday during 10:30 to 11:00, 12:00 to 15:00, 15:30 to 17:00; 

 Here is the proposed time: Monday, 9:30 - 10:30. Verify that the proposed time satisfies all the constraints or provide an alternative plan.

FINAL-PLAN
------------------------------
availability_arthur:
- Busy intervals (Monday):
  - 09:00-09:30
  - 10:30-12:00
  - 16:00-17:00
- Hard constraints: cannot attend any meeting overlapping the above intervals.
- Meeting requirement: attend a 60-minute meeting between 09:00 and 17:00 (interpreted as two consecutive 30-minute slots).

availability_michael:
- Busy intervals (Monday):
  - 13:00-13:30
  - 14:00-14:30
- Hard constraints: cannot attend any meeting overlapping the above intervals.
- Meeting requirement: attend a 60-minute meeting between 09:00 and 17:00.

availability_samantha:
- Busy intervals (Monday):
  - 10:30-11:00
  - 12:00-15:00
  - 15:30-17:00
- Hard constraints: cannot attend any meeting overlapping the above intervals.
- Meeting requirement: attend a 60-minute meeting between 09:00 and 17:00.

Reasoning (summary and earliest feasible slot):
- I discretize the day 09:00–17:00 into 30-minute slots:
  - slot1 = 09:00-09:30
  - slot2 = 09:30-10:00
  - slot3 = 10:00-10:30
  - slot4 = 10:30-11:00
  - slot5 = 11:00-11:30
  - slot6 = 11:30-12:00
  - slot7 = 12:00-12:30
  - slot8 = 12:30-13:00
  - slot9 = 13:00-13:30
  - slot10 = 13:30-14:00
  - slot11 = 14:00-14:30
  - slot12 = 14:30-15:00
  - slot13 = 15:00-15:30
  - slot14 = 15:30-16:00
  - slot15 = 16:00-16:30
  - slot16 = 16:30-17:00
- A 60-minute meeting occupies two consecutive slots (slot N and slot N+1). All busy intervals are mapped to corresponding slots and treated as unavailable (no "free" facts in the initial state).
- Computed free slots (not listed in initial state) per participant:
  - Arthur free: slot2, slot3, slot7, slot8, slot9, slot10, slot11, slot12, slot13, slot14
  - Michael free: slot1, slot2, slot3, slot4, slot5, slot6, slot7, slot8, slot10, slot12, slot13, slot14, slot15, slot16
  - Samantha free: slot1, slot2, slot3, slot5, slot6, slot13
- The earliest pair of consecutive slots that are free for all three is slot2 + slot3 (09:30-10:30). No earlier 2-slot window is available for all participants.
- Because the specification requires preferring the earliest feasible slot and to encode all busy intervals as hard constraints, the PDDL model allows scheduling only where all participants are free; the planner will therefore pick the only applicable scheduling action (slot2->slot3).

Below I emit a classical STRIPS-style PDDL domain and problem compatible with Fast Downward. The domain uses distinct predicates for each participant (free-arthur, free-michael, free-samantha), encodes adjacency of slots via next, and provides a single parameterized schedule action that requires two consecutive free slots for all participants. The problem encodes the initial free facts according to the provided busy intervals so only the feasible scheduling choice (09:30-10:30) is applicable.

Step 1 — schedule-meeting slot2 slot3
- Action: Orchestrator schedules the 60‑minute meeting occupying slot2 and slot3.
- Time slots:
  - slot2 = Monday 09:30–10:00
  - slot3 = Monday 10:00–10:30
- Meeting duration: 60 minutes (09:30–10:30 on Monday).
- Participants confirmed free for both slots: Arthur, Michael, Samantha.
- Effect: Meeting is scheduled (goal satisfied).
================================================================================


PROBLEM
------------------------------
You are an expert at scheduling meetings. You are given a few constraints on the existing schedule of each participant, the meeting duration, and possibly some preferences on the meeting time. Note there exists a solution that works with existing schedule of every participant.TASK: You need to schedule a meeting for Donna, John and Billy for half an hour between the work hours of 9:00 to 17:00 on Monday. 

Here are the existing schedules for everyone during the day: 
Donna is busy on Monday during 14:00 to 14:30, 15:30 to 16:00; 
John is busy on Monday during 11:00 to 11:30, 16:30 to 17:00; 
Billy is busy on Monday during 9:00 to 10:00, 10:30 to 14:00, 14:30 to 17:00; 

 Here is the proposed time: Monday, 10:00 - 10:30. Verify that the proposed time satisfies all the constraints or provide an alternative plan.

1) Action: choose slot1000
   - Effect: Schedule the meeting for 30 minutes.
   - Time (timestamp): Monday, 10:00–10:30.

PROBLEM
------------------------------
You are an expert at scheduling meetings. You are given a few constraints on the existing schedule of each participant, the meeting duration, and possibly some preferences on the meeting time. Note there exists a solution that works with existing schedule of every participant.TASK: You need to schedule a meeting for Kathryn, Charlotte and Lauren for half an hour between the work hours of 9:00 to 17:00 on Monday. 

Here are the existing schedules for everyone during the day: 
Kathryn has blocked their calendar on Monday during 9:00 to 9:30, 10:30 to 11:00, 11:30 to 12:00, 13:30 to 14:30, 16:30 to 17:00; 
Charlotte has blocked their calendar on Monday during 12:00 to 12:30, 16:00 to 16:30; 
Lauren has blocked their calendar on Monday during 9:00 to 10:00, 12:00 to 12:30, 13:30 to 14:30, 15:00 to 16:00, 16:30 to 17:00; 

Charlotte do not want to meet on Monday after 13:30. Here is the proposed time: Monday, 12:30 - 13:00. Verify that the proposed time satisfies all the constraints or provide an alternative plan.

NATURAL-PLAN sas_plan_4
------------------------------
Step 1 — schedule(s1000)
- Action: Schedule a 30-minute meeting.
- Day & time: Monday, 10:00 — 10:30.
- Participants: Kathryn, Charlotte, Lauren.
- Why valid: s1000 is an allowed start; Kathryn, Charlotte, and Lauren are all free at 10:00; Charlotte’s preference (no meetings starting after 13:30) is satisfied.
- Outcome: Meeting is scheduled (goal achieved).
