Step 1 — action: schedule-s1000
- Schedule a 30-minute meeting on Monday starting at 10:00 and ending at 10:30.
- Participants: Kathryn, Charlotte, Lauren.
- Rationale: this start time fits all participants' availabilities and respects Charlotte’s preference (no meetings starting after 13:30).
- (Matches plan action "schedule-s1000"; plan cost = 2.)
