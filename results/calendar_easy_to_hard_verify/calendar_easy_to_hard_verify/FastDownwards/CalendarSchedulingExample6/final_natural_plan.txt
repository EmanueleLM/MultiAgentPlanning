Step 1 — Action (as in the plan):
  schedule-meeting s11 s12 dylan dylan dylan

Human-readable interpretation:
  Schedule a 60-minute meeting on Monday from 14:30 to 15:30 (this uses slots s11 = 14:30–15:00 and s12 = 15:00–15:30).

Participants:
  Thomas, Dylan, Jerry (the chosen slot is compatible with each participant's calendar).

Why this satisfies the goal:
  - Meeting duration: 60 minutes (two consecutive 30-minute slots s11 and s12).
  - Thomas is free the whole work day (09:00–17:00).
  - Dylan is busy only 10:30–11:00 and 13:30–14:00, so 14:30–15:30 is free for Dylan.
  - Jerry is free at 14:30–15:30 (other busy intervals do not cover s11–s12).
  - Therefore the scheduled meeting (14:30–15:30) fits all participants and achieves the goal (meeting scheduled at slot s11).
