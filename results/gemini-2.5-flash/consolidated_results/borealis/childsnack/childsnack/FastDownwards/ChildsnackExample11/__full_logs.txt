- The natural language description of the domain:
<domain_nl>
The child-snack domain is designed to plan the preparation and serving of sandwiches to children, some of whom have gluten allergies. The domain includes actions for making sandwiches with and without gluten, placing sandwiches on trays, moving trays between places, and serving the sandwiches to the children.

The actions defined in this domain include:

1. make_sandwich_no_gluten: This action is for making a gluten-free sandwich. The preconditions for this action are that there must be gluten-free bread and gluten-free content available in the kitchen, and the sandwich must not already exist. The effect of this action is that the gluten-free bread and content are no longer available in the kitchen, and a gluten-free sandwich is now available in the kitchen.

2. make_sandwich: This action is for making a regular sandwich that may contain gluten. The preconditions are that there must be bread and content available in the kitchen, and the sandwich must not already exist. The effect of this action is that the bread and content are no longer available in the kitchen, and a sandwich is now available in the kitchen.

3. put_on_tray: This action is for placing a sandwich on a tray. The preconditions are that the sandwich must be in the kitchen and the tray must be at the kitchen. The effect is that the sandwich is no longer in the kitchen and is now on the tray.

4. serve_sandwich_no_gluten: This action is for serving a gluten-free sandwich to a child who is allergic to gluten. The preconditions are that the child is allergic to gluten, waiting at a place, and there is a gluten-free sandwich on a tray at the same place. The effect is that the sandwich is no longer on the tray and the child is served.

5. serve_sandwich: This action is for serving a sandwich to a child who is not allergic to gluten. The preconditions are that the child is not allergic to gluten, waiting at a place, and there is a sandwich on a tray at the same place. The effect is that the sandwich is no longer on the tray and the child is served.

6. move_tray: This action allows a tray to be moved from one place to another. The precondition is that the tray is at the starting place. The effect is that the tray is no longer at the starting place and is now at the destination place.

- The natural language description of the problem:
<problem_nl>
You are tasked with preparing and serving sandwiches to seven children, some of whom have gluten allergies, using a set of actions that involve making sandwiches, placing them on trays, moving trays, and serving the sandwiches.

Initially:
- There are two trays, tray1 and tray2, both located in the kitchen.
- There are seven portions of bread, bread1 through bread7, all in the kitchen.
- There are seven portions of content, content1 through content7, all in the kitchen.
- Bread portions bread2 and bread6 are gluten-free.
- Content portions content3 and content7 are gluten-free.
- Child1 and child5 are allergic to gluten.
- Child2, child3, child4, child6, and child7 are not allergic to gluten.
- Child1 is waiting at table2.
- Child2 and child5 are waiting at table1.
- Child3 is waiting at table3.
- Child4 and child7 are waiting at table2.
- Child6 is waiting at table1.
- There are ten sandwiches, sandw1 through sandw10, which do not exist yet.

Your goal is to ensure that:
- All seven children, child1 through child7, are served with a sandwich that they are not allergic to.

PROBLEM
------------------------------
You are an expert planner. I will provide you with:
- A natural language description of the domain.
- A natural language description of the problem. 
- A PDDL domain template.
- A PDDL problem template.

Here are:
- The natural language description of the domain:
<domain_nl>
The child-snack domain is designed to plan the preparation and serving of sandwiches to children, some of whom have gluten allergies. The domain includes actions for making sandwiches with and without gluten, placing sandwiches on trays, moving trays between places, and serving the sandwiches to the children.

The actions defined in this domain include:

1. make_sandwich_no_gluten: This action is for making a gluten-free sandwich. The preconditions for this action are that there must be gluten-free bread and gluten-free content available in the kitchen, and the sandwich must not already exist. The effect of this action is that the gluten-free bread and content are no longer available in the kitchen, and a gluten-free sandwich is now available in the kitchen.

2. make_sandwich: This action is for making a regular sandwich that may contain gluten. The preconditions are that there must be bread and content available in the kitchen, and the sandwich must not already exist. The effect of this action is that the bread and content are no longer available in the kitchen, and a sandwich is now available in the kitchen.

3. put_on_tray: This action is for placing a sandwich on a tray. The preconditions are that the sandwich must be in the kitchen and the tray must be at the kitchen. The effect is that the sandwich is no longer in the kitchen and is now on the tray.

4. serve_sandwich_no_gluten: This action is for serving a gluten-free sandwich to a child who is allergic to gluten. The preconditions are that the child is allergic to gluten, waiting at a place, and there is a gluten-free sandwich on a tray at the same place. The effect is that the sandwich is no longer on the tray and the child is served.

5. serve_sandwich: This action is for serving a sandwich to a child who is not allergic to gluten. The preconditions are that the child is not allergic to gluten, waiting at a place, and there is a sandwich on a tray at the same place. The effect is that the sandwich is no longer on the tray and the child is served.

6. move_tray: This action allows a tray to be moved from one place to another. The precondition is that the tray is at the starting place. The effect is that the tray is no longer at the starting place and is now at the destination place.

- The natural language description of the problem:
<problem_nl>
You are tasked with preparing and serving sandwiches to eight children, some of whom have gluten allergies, using a set of actions that involve making sandwiches, placing them on trays, moving trays, and serving the sandwiches.

Initially:
- There are two trays, tray1 and tray2, both located in the kitchen.
- There are eight portions of bread, bread1 through bread8, all in the kitchen.
- There are eight portions of content, content1 through content8, all in the kitchen.
- Bread portions bread2, bread3, and bread7 are gluten-free.
- Content portions content1, content4, and content5 are gluten-free.
- Child1, child4, and child6 are allergic to gluten.
- Child2, child3, child5, child7, and child8 are not allergic to gluten.
- Child1 and child4 are waiting at table2.
- Child2, child3, child5, and child6 are waiting at table1.
- Child7 is waiting at table2.
- Child8 is waiting at table3.
- There are eleven sandwiches, sandw1 through sandw11, which do not exist yet.

Your goal is to ensure that:
- All eight children, child1 through child8, are served with a sandwich that they are not allergic to.

The domain includes actions for making sandwiches with and without gluten, placing sandwiches on trays, moving trays between places, and serving the sandwiches to the children.\n\nThe actions defined in this domain include:\n\n1. make_sandwich_no_gluten: This action is for making a gluten-free sandwich. The preconditions for this action are that there must be gluten-free bread and gluten-free content available in the kitchen, and the sandwich must not already exist. The effect of this action is that the gluten-free bread and content are no longer available in the kitchen, and a gluten-free sandwich is now available in the kitchen.\n\n2. make_sandwich: This action is for making a regular sandwich that may contain gluten. The preconditions are that there must be bread and content available in the kitchen, and the sandwich must not already exist. The effect of this action is that the bread and content are no longer available in the kitchen, and a sandwich is now available in the kitchen.\n\n3. put_on_tray: This action is for placing a sandwich on a tray. The preconditions are that the sandwich must be in the kitchen and the tray must be at the kitchen. The effect is that the sandwich is no longer in the kitchen and is now on the tray.\n\n4. serve_sandwich_no_gluten: This action is for serving a gluten-free sandwich to a child who is allergic to gluten. The preconditions are that the child is allergic to gluten, waiting at a place, and there is a gluten-free sandwich on a tray at the same place. The effect is that the sandwich is no longer on the tray and the child is served.\n\n5. serve_sandwich: This action is for serving a sandwich to a child who is not allergic to gluten. The preconditions are that the child is not allergic to gluten, waiting at a place, and there is a sandwich on a tray at the same place. The effect is that the sandwich is no longer on the tray and the child is served.\n\n6. move_tray: This action allows a tray to be moved from one place to another.

Here are:
- The natural language description of the domain:
<domain_nl>
The child-snack domain is designed to plan the preparation and serving of sandwiches to children, some of whom have gluten allergies. The domain includes actions for making sandwiches with and without gluten, placing sandwiches on trays, moving trays between places, and serving the sandwiches to the children.

The actions defined in this domain include:

1. make_sandwich_no_gluten: This action is for making a gluten-free sandwich. The preconditions for this action are that there must be gluten-free bread and gluten-free content available in the kitchen, and the sandwich must not already exist. The effect of this action is that the gluten-free bread and content are no longer available in the kitchen, and a gluten-free sandwich is now available in the kitchen.

2. make_sandwich: This action is for making a regular sandwich that may contain gluten. The preconditions are that there must be bread and content available in the kitchen, and the sandwich must not already exist. The effect of this action is that the bread and content are no longer available in the kitchen, and a sandwich is now available in the kitchen.

3. put_on_tray: This action is for placing a sandwich on a tray. The preconditions are that the sandwich must be in the kitchen and the tray must be at the kitchen. The effect is that the sandwich is no longer in the kitchen and is now on the tray.

4. serve_sandwich_no_gluten: This action is for serving a gluten-free sandwich to a child who is allergic to gluten. The preconditions are that the child is allergic to gluten, waiting at a place, and there is a gluten-free sandwich on a tray at the same place. The effect is that the sandwich is no longer on the tray and the child is served.

5. serve_sandwich: This action is for serving a sandwich to a child who is not allergic to gluten. The preconditions are that the child is not allergic to gluten, waiting at a place, and there is a sandwich on a tray at the same place. The effect is that the sandwich is no longer on the tray and the child is served.

6. move_tray: This action allows a tray to be moved from one place to another. The precondition is that the tray is at the starting place. The effect is that the tray is no longer at the starting place and is now at the destination place.

- The natural language description of the problem:
<problem_nl>
You are tasked with preparing and serving sandwiches to eight children, some of whom have gluten allergies, using a set of actions that involve making sandwiches, placing them on trays, moving trays, and serving the sandwiches.

Initially:
- There are two trays, tray1 and tray2, both located in the kitchen.
- There are eight portions of bread, bread1 through bread8, all in the kitchen.
- There are eight portions of content, content1 through content8, all in the kitchen.
- Bread portions bread2, bread5, and bread6 are gluten-free.
- Content portions content4, content7, and content8 are gluten-free.
- Child2, child7, and child8 are allergic to gluten.
- Child1, child3, child4, child5, and child6 are not allergic to gluten.
- Child1 and child3 are waiting at table3.
- Child2, child4, child5, and child6 are waiting at table1.
- Child7 is waiting at table3.
- Child8 is waiting at table2.
- There are eleven sandwiches, sandw1 through sandw11, which do not exist yet.

Your goal is to ensure that:
- All eight children, child1 through child8, are served with a sandwich that they are not allergic to.

- The natural language description of the domain:
<domain_nl>
The child-snack domain is designed to plan the preparation and serving of sandwiches to children, some of whom have gluten allergies. The domain includes actions for making sandwiches with and without gluten, placing sandwiches on trays, moving trays between places, and serving the sandwiches to the children.

The actions defined in this domain include:

1. make_sandwich_no_gluten: This action is for making a gluten-free sandwich. The preconditions for this action are that there must be gluten-free bread and gluten-free content available in the kitchen, and the sandwich must not already exist. The effect of this action is that the gluten-free bread and content are no longer available in the kitchen, and a gluten-free sandwich is now available in the kitchen.

2. make_sandwich: This action is for making a regular sandwich that may contain gluten. The preconditions are that there must be bread and content available in the kitchen, and the sandwich must not already exist. The effect of this action is that the bread and content are no longer available in the kitchen, and a sandwich is now available in the kitchen.

3. put_on_tray: This action is for placing a sandwich on a tray. The preconditions are that the sandwich must be in the kitchen and the tray must be at the kitchen. The effect is that the sandwich is no longer in the kitchen and is now on the tray.

4. serve_sandwich_no_gluten: This action is for serving a gluten-free sandwich to a child who is allergic to gluten. The preconditions are that the child is allergic to gluten, waiting at a place, and there is a gluten-free sandwich on a tray at the same place. The effect is that the sandwich is no longer on the tray and the child is served.

5. serve_sandwich: This action is for serving a sandwich to a child who is not allergic to gluten. The preconditions are that the child is not allergic to gluten, waiting at a place, and there is a sandwich on a tray at the same place. The effect is that the sandwich is no longer on the tray and the child is served.

6. move_tray: This action allows a tray to be moved from one place to another. The precondition is that the tray is at the starting place. The effect is that the tray is no longer at the starting place and is now at the destination place.

- The natural language description of the problem:
<problem_nl>
You are tasked with preparing and serving sandwiches to eight children, some of whom have gluten allergies, using a set of actions that involve making sandwiches, placing them on trays, moving trays, and serving the sandwiches.

Initially:
- There are two trays, tray1 and tray2, both located in the kitchen.
- There are eight portions of bread, bread1 through bread8, all in the kitchen.
- There are eight portions of content, content1 through content8, all in the kitchen.
- Bread portions bread2, bread5, and bread6 are gluten-free.
- Content portions content4, content7, and content8 are gluten-free.
- Child2, child7, and child8 are allergic to gluten.
- Child1, child3, child4, child5, and child6 are not allergic to gluten.
- Child1 and child3 are waiting at table3.
- Child2, child4, child5, and child6 are waiting at table1.
- Child7 is waiting at table3.
- Child8 is waiting at table2.
- There are eleven sandwiches, sandw1 through sandw11, which do not exist yet.

Your goal is to ensure that:
- All eight children, child1 through child8, are served with a sandwich that they are not allergic to.

<domain_nl>
The child-snack domain is designed to plan the preparation and serving of sandwiches to children, some of whom have gluten allergies. The domain includes actions for making sandwiches with and without gluten, placing sandwiches on trays, moving trays between places, and serving the sandwiches to the children.

The actions defined in this domain include:

1. make_sandwich_no_gluten: This action is for making a gluten-free sandwich. The preconditions for this action are that there must be gluten-free bread and gluten-free content available in the kitchen, and the sandwich must not already exist. The effect of this action is that the gluten-free bread and content are no longer available in the kitchen, and a gluten-free sandwich is now available in the kitchen.

2. make_sandwich: This action is for making a regular sandwich that may contain gluten. The preconditions are that there must be bread and content available in the kitchen, and the sandwich must not already exist. The effect of this action is that the bread and content are no longer available in the kitchen, and a sandwich is now available in the kitchen.

3. put_on_tray: This action is for placing a sandwich on a tray. The preconditions are that the sandwich must be in the kitchen and the tray must be at the kitchen. The effect is that the sandwich is no longer in the kitchen and is now on the tray.

4. serve_sandwich_no_gluten: This action is for serving a gluten-free sandwich to a child who is allergic to gluten. The preconditions are that the child is allergic to gluten, waiting at a place, and there is a gluten-free sandwich on a tray at the same place. The effect is that the sandwich is no longer on the tray and the child is served.

5. serve_sandwich: This action is for serving a sandwich to a child who is not allergic to gluten. The preconditions are that the child is not allergic to gluten, waiting at a place, and there is a sandwich on a tray at the same place. The effect is that the sandwich is no longer on the tray and the child is served.

6. move_tray: This action allows a tray to be moved from one place to another. The precondition is that the tray is at the starting place. The effect is that the tray is no longer at the starting place and is now at the destination place.

PROBLEM
------------------------------
You are an expert planner. I will provide you with:

- A natural language description of the problem. 
- A PDDL domain template.
- A PDDL problem template.

Here are:
- The natural language description of the domain:
<domain_nl>
The child-snack domain is designed to plan the preparation and serving of sandwiches to children, some of whom have gluten allergies. The domain includes actions for making sandwiches with and without gluten, placing sandwiches on trays, moving trays between places, and serving the sandwiches to the children.

The actions defined in this domain include:

1. make_sandwich_no_gluten: This action is for making a gluten-free sandwich. The preconditions for this action are that there must be gluten-free bread and gluten-free content available in the kitchen, and the sandwich must not already exist. The effect of this action is that the gluten-free bread and content are no longer available in the kitchen, and a gluten-free sandwich is now available in the kitchen.

2. make_sandwich: This action is for making a regular sandwich that may contain gluten. The preconditions are that there must be bread and content available in the kitchen, and the sandwich must not already exist. The effect of this action is that the bread and content are no longer available in the kitchen, and a sandwich is now available in the kitchen.

3. put_on_tray: This action is for placing a sandwich on a tray. The preconditions are that the sandwich must be in the kitchen and the tray must be at the kitchen. The effect is that the sandwich is no longer in the kitchen and is now on the tray.

4. serve_sandwich_no_gluten: This action is for serving a gluten-free sandwich to a child who is allergic to gluten. The preconditions are that the child is allergic to gluten, waiting at a place, and there is a gluten-free sandwich on a tray at the same place. The effect is that the sandwich is no longer on the tray and the child is served.

5. serve_sandwich: This action is for serving a sandwich to a child who is not allergic to gluten. The preconditions are that the child is not allergic to gluten, waiting at a place, and there is a sandwich on a tray at the same place. The effect is that the sandwich is no longer on the tray and the child is served.

6. move_tray: This action allows a tray to be moved from one place to another. The precondition is that the tray is at the starting place. The effect is that the tray is no longer at the starting place and is now at the destination place.

- The natural language description of the problem:
<problem_nl>
You are tasked with preparing and serving sandwiches to nine children, some of whom have gluten allergies, using a set of actions that involve making sandwiches, placing them on trays, moving trays, and serving the sandwiches.

Initially:
- There are three trays, tray1, tray2, and tray3, all located in the kitchen.
- There are nine portions of bread, bread1 through bread9, all in the kitchen.
- There are nine portions of content, content1 through content9, all in the kitchen.
- Bread portions bread6, bread2, and bread7 are gluten-free.
- Content portions content9, content4, and content5 are gluten-free.
- Child9, child2, and child3 are allergic to gluten.
- Child1, child4, child5, child6, child7, and child8 are not allergic to gluten.
- Child1 is waiting at table3.
- Child2, child4, child5, and child6 are waiting at table1.
- Child3 and child7 are waiting at table3.
- Child8 and child9 are waiting at table2.
- There are twelve sandwiches, sandw1 through sandw12, which do not exist yet.

Your goal is to ensure that:
- All nine children, child1 through child9, are served with a sandwich that they are not allergic to.

The effect is that the sandwich is no longer in the kitchen and is now on the tray.\n\n4. serve_sandwich_no_gluten: This action is for serving a gluten-free sandwich to a child who is allergic to gluten. The preconditions are that the child is allergic to gluten, waiting at a place, and there is a gluten-free sandwich on a tray at the same place. The effect is that the sandwich is no longer on the tray and the child is served.\n\n5. serve_sandwich: This action is for serving a sandwich to a child who is not allergic to gluten. The preconditions are that the child is not allergic to gluten, waiting at a place, and there is a sandwich on a tray at the same place. The effect is that the sandwich is no longer on the tray and the child is served.\n\n6. move_tray: This action allows a tray to be moved from one place to another.

The domain includes actions for making sandwiches with and without gluten, placing sandwiches on trays, moving trays between places, and serving the sandwiches to the children.\n\nThe actions defined in this domain include:\n\n1. make_sandwich_no_gluten: This action is for making a gluten-free sandwich. The preconditions for this action are that there must be gluten-free bread and gluten-free content available in the kitchen, and the sandwich must not already exist. The effect of this action is that the gluten-free bread and content are no longer available in the kitchen, and a gluten-free sandwich is now available in the kitchen.\n\n2. make_sandwich: This action is for making a regular sandwich that may contain gluten. The preconditions are that there must be bread and content available in the kitchen, and the sandwich must not already exist. The effect of this action is that the bread and content are no longer available in the kitchen, and a sandwich is now available in the kitchen.\n\n3. put_on_tray: This action is for placing a sandwich on a tray. The preconditions are that the sandwich must be in the kitchen and the tray must be at the kitchen. The effect is that the sandwich is no longer in the kitchen and is now on the tray.\n\n4. serve_sandwich_no_gluten: This action is for serving a gluten-free sandwich to a child who is allergic to gluten. The preconditions are that the child is allergic to gluten, waiting at a place, and there is a gluten-free sandwich on a tray at the same place. The effect is that the sandwich is no longer on the tray and the child is served.\n\n5. serve_sandwich: This action is for serving a sandwich to a child who is not allergic to gluten. The preconditions are that the child is not allergic to gluten, waiting at a place, and there is a sandwich on a tray at the same place. The effect is that the sandwich is no longer on the tray and the child is served.\n\n6. move_tray: This action allows a tray to be moved from one place to another. The precondition is that the tray is at the starting place. The effect is that the tray is no longer at the starting place and is now at the destination place.\n</domain_nl>\n\nPDDL DOMAIN TEMPLATE:\n<domain_template>\n(define (domain child-snack)\n  (:requirements :typing :equality)\n  (:types child bread-portion content-portion sandwich tray place)\n  (:constants kitchen - place)\n\n  (:predicates)\n\n  (:action make_sandwich_no_gluten\n    :parameters (?s - sandwich ?b - bread-portion ?c - content-portion)\n    :precondition ()\n    :effect ()\n  )\n\n  (:action make_sandwich\n    :parameters (?s - sandwich ?b - bread-portion ?c - content-portion)\n    :precondition ()\n    :effect ()\n  )\n\n  (:action put_on_tray\n    :parameters (?s - sandwich ?t - tray)\n    :precondition ()\n    :effect ()\n  )\n\n  (:action serve_sandwich_no_gluten\n    :parameters (?s - sandwich ?c - child ?t - tray ?p - place)\n    :precondition ()\n    :effect ()\n  )\n\n  (:action serve_sandwich\n    :parameters (?s - sandwich ?c - child ?t - tray ?p - place)\n    :precondition ()\n    :effect ()\n  )\n\n  (:action move_tray\n    :parameters (?t - tray ?p1 ?p2 - place)\n    :precondition ()\n    :effect ()\n  )\n)\n</domain_template>\n\nBased on the NL description, define the necessary predicates and fill in the preconditions and effects for all actions.

PROBLEM
------------------------------
You are an expert planner. I will provide you with:
- A natural language description of the domain.
- A natural language description of the problem. 
- A PDDL domain template.
- A PDDL problem template.

Here are:
- The natural language description of the domain:
<domain_nl>
The child-snack domain is designed to plan the preparation and serving of sandwiches to children, some of whom have gluten allergies. The domain includes actions for making sandwiches with and without gluten, placing sandwiches on trays, moving trays between places, and serving the sandwiches to the children.

The actions defined in this domain include:

1. make_sandwich_no_gluten: This action is for making a gluten-free sandwich. The preconditions for this action are that there must be gluten-free bread and gluten-free content available in the kitchen, and the sandwich must not already exist. The effect of this action is that the gluten-free bread and content are no longer available in the kitchen, and a gluten-free sandwich is now available in the kitchen.

2. make_sandwich: This action is for making a regular sandwich that may contain gluten. The preconditions are that there must be bread and content available in the kitchen, and the sandwich must not already exist. The effect of this action is that the bread and content are no longer available in the kitchen, and a sandwich is now available in the kitchen.

3. put_on_tray: This action is for placing a sandwich on a tray. The preconditions are that the sandwich must be in the kitchen and the tray must be at the kitchen. The effect is that the sandwich is no longer in the kitchen and is now on the tray.

4. serve_sandwich_no_gluten: This action is for serving a gluten-free sandwich to a child who is allergic to gluten. The preconditions are that the child is allergic to gluten, waiting at a place, and there is a gluten-free sandwich on a tray at the same place. The effect is that the sandwich is no longer on the tray and the child is served.

5. serve_sandwich: This action is for serving a sandwich to a child who is not allergic to gluten. The preconditions are that the child is not allergic to gluten, waiting at a place, and there is a sandwich on a tray at the same place. The effect is that the sandwich is no longer on the tray and the child is served.

6. move_tray: This action allows a tray to be moved from one place to another. The precondition is that the tray is at the starting place. The effect is that the tray is no longer at the starting place and is now at the destination place.

- The natural language description of the problem:
<problem_nl>
You are tasked with preparing and serving sandwiches to ten children, some of whom have gluten allergies, using a set of actions that involve making sandwiches, placing them on trays, moving trays, and serving the sandwiches.

Initially:
- There are three trays, tray1, tray2, and tray3, all located in the kitchen.
- There are ten portions of bread, bread1 through bread10, all in the kitchen.
- There are ten portions of content, content1 through content10, all in the kitchen.
- Bread portions bread2, bread9, bread4, and bread8 are gluten-free.
- Content portions content2, content8, content4, and content1 are gluten-free.
- Child1, child10, child3, and child4 are allergic to gluten.
- Child2, child5, child6, child7, child8, and child9 are not allergic to gluten.
- Child1 and child4 are waiting at table2.
- Child2, child3, and child9 are waiting at table1.
- Child5, child6, child7, and child10 are waiting at table3.
- Child8 is waiting at table2.
- There are thirteen sandwiches, sandw1 through sandw13, which do not exist yet.

Your goal is to ensure that:
- All ten children, child1 through child10, are served with a sandwich that they are not allergic to.

Here are:
- The natural language description of the domain:
<domain_nl>
The child-snack domain is designed to plan the preparation and serving of sandwiches to children, some of whom have gluten allergies. The domain includes actions for making sandwiches with and without gluten, placing sandwiches on trays, moving trays between places, and serving the sandwiches to the children.

The actions defined in this domain include:

1. make_sandwich_no_gluten: This action is for making a gluten-free sandwich. The preconditions for this action are that there must be gluten-free bread and gluten-free content available in the kitchen, and the sandwich must not already exist. The effect of this action is that the gluten-free bread and content are no longer available in the kitchen, and a gluten-free sandwich is now available in the kitchen.

2. make_sandwich: This action is for making a regular sandwich that may contain gluten. The preconditions are that there must be bread and content available in the kitchen, and the sandwich must not already exist. The effect of this action is that the bread and content are no longer available in the kitchen, and a sandwich is now available in the kitchen.

3. put_on_tray: This action is for placing a sandwich on a tray. The preconditions are that the sandwich must be in the kitchen and the tray must be at the kitchen. The effect is that the sandwich is no longer in the kitchen and is now on the tray.

4. serve_sandwich_no_gluten: This action is for serving a gluten-free sandwich to a child who is allergic to gluten. The preconditions are that the child is allergic to gluten, waiting at a place, and there is a gluten-free sandwich on a tray at the same place. The effect is that the sandwich is no longer on the tray and the child is served.

5. serve_sandwich: This action is for serving a sandwich to a child who is not allergic to gluten. The preconditions are that the child is not allergic to gluten, waiting at a place, and there is a sandwich on a tray at the same place. The effect is that the sandwich is no longer on the tray and the child is served.

6. move_tray: This action allows a tray to be moved from one place to another. The precondition is that the tray is at the starting place. The effect is that the tray is no longer at the starting place and is now at the destination place.

The domain includes actions for making sandwiches with and without gluten, placing sandwiches on trays, moving trays between places, and serving the sandwiches to the children.

The actions defined in this domain include:

1. make_sandwich_no_gluten: This action is for making a gluten-free sandwich. The preconditions for this action are that there must be gluten-free bread and gluten-free content available in the kitchen, and the sandwich must not already exist. The effect of this action is that the gluten-free bread and content are no longer available in the kitchen, and a gluten-free sandwich is now available in the kitchen.

2. make_sandwich: This action is for making a regular sandwich that may contain gluten. The preconditions are that there must be bread and content available in the kitchen, and the sandwich must not already exist. The effect of this action is that the bread and content are no longer available in the kitchen, and a sandwich is now available in the kitchen.

3. put_on_tray: This action is for placing a sandwich on a tray. The preconditions are that the sandwich must be in the kitchen and the tray must be at the kitchen. The effect is that the sandwich is no longer in the kitchen and is now on the tray.

4. serve_sandwich_no_gluten: This action is for serving a gluten-free sandwich to a child who is allergic to gluten. The preconditions are that the child is allergic to gluten, waiting at a place, and there is a gluten-free sandwich on a tray at the same place. The effect is that the sandwich is no longer on the tray and the child is served.

5. serve_sandwich: This action is for serving a sandwich to a child who is not allergic to gluten. The preconditions are that the child is not allergic to gluten, waiting at a place, and there is a sandwich on a tray at the same place. The effect is that the sandwich is no longer on the tray and the child is served.

6. move_tray: This action allows a tray to be moved from one place to another. The precondition is that the tray is at the starting place. The effect is that the tray is no longer at the starting place and is now at the destination place.

Here are:
- The natural language description of the domain:
<domain_nl>
The child-snack domain is designed to plan the preparation and serving of sandwiches to children, some of whom have gluten allergies. The domain includes actions for making sandwiches with and without gluten, placing sandwiches on trays, moving trays between places, and serving the sandwiches to the children.

The actions defined in this domain include:

1. make_sandwich_no_gluten: This action is for making a gluten-free sandwich. The preconditions for this action are that there must be gluten-free bread and gluten-free content available in the kitchen, and the sandwich must not already exist. The effect of this action is that the gluten-free bread and content are no longer available in the kitchen, and a gluten-free sandwich is now available in the kitchen.

2. make_sandwich: This action is for making a regular sandwich that may contain gluten. The preconditions are that there must be bread and content available in the kitchen, and the sandwich must not already exist. The effect of this action is that the bread and content are no longer available in the kitchen, and a sandwich is now available in the kitchen.

3. put_on_tray: This action is for placing a sandwich on a tray. The preconditions are that the sandwich must be in the kitchen and the tray must be at the kitchen. The effect is that the sandwich is no longer in the kitchen and is now on the tray.

4. serve_sandwich_no_gluten: This action is for serving a gluten-free sandwich to a child who is allergic to gluten. The preconditions are that the child is allergic to gluten, waiting at a place, and there is a gluten-free sandwich on a tray at the same place. The effect is that the sandwich is no longer on the tray and the child is served.

5. serve_sandwich: This action is for serving a sandwich to a child who is not allergic to gluten. The preconditions are that the child is not allergic to gluten, waiting at a place, and there is a sandwich on a tray at the same place. The effect is that the sandwich is no longer on the tray and the child is served.

6. move_tray: This action allows a tray to be moved from one place to another. The precondition is that the tray is at the starting place. The effect is that the tray is no longer at the starting place and is now at the destination place.

- The natural language description of the problem:
<problem_nl>
You are tasked with preparing and serving sandwiches to eleven children, some of whom have gluten allergies, using a set of actions that involve making sandwiches, placing them on trays, moving trays, and serving the sandwiches.

Initially:
- There are three trays, tray1, tray2, and tray3, all located in the kitchen.
- There are eleven portions of bread, bread1 through bread11, all in the kitchen.
- There are eleven portions of content, content1 through content11, all in the kitchen.
- Bread portions bread2, bread7, bread8, and bread9 are gluten-free.
- Content portions content2, content6, content7, and content9 are gluten-free.
- Child2, child4, child7, and child8 are allergic to gluten.
- Child1, child3, child5, child6, child9, child10, and child11 are not allergic to gluten.
- Child1, child2, child3, and child10 are waiting at table1.
- Child5, child6, child8, child9, and child11 are waiting at table2.
- Child4 is waiting at table3.
- There are fifteen sandwiches, sandw1 through sandw15, which do not exist yet.

Your goal is to ensure that:
- All eleven children, child1 through child11, are served with a sandwich that they are not allergic to.

I will provide you with:\n- A natural language description of the domain.\n- A natural language description of the problem. \n- A PDDL domain template.\n- A PDDL problem template.\n\nHere are:\n- The natural language description of the domain:\n<domain_nl>\nThe child-snack domain is designed to plan the preparation and serving of sandwiches to children, some of whom have gluten allergies. The domain includes actions for making sandwiches with and without gluten, placing sandwiches on trays, moving trays between places, and serving the sandwiches to the children.\n\nThe actions defined in this domain include:\n\n1. make_sandwich_no_gluten: This action is for making a gluten-free sandwich. The preconditions for this action are that there must be gluten-free bread and gluten-free content available in the kitchen, and the sandwich must not already exist. The effect of this action is that the gluten-free bread and content are no longer available in the kitchen, and a gluten-free sandwich is now available in the kitchen.\n\n2. make_sandwich: This action is for making a regular sandwich that may contain gluten. The preconditions are that there must be bread and content available in the kitchen, and the sandwich must not already exist. The effect of this action is that the bread and content are no longer available in the kitchen, and a sandwich is now available in the kitchen.\n\n3. put_on_tray: This action is for placing a sandwich on a tray. The preconditions are that the sandwich must be in the kitchen and the tray must be at the kitchen. The effect is that the sandwich is no longer in the kitchen and is now on the tray.\n\n4. serve_sandwich_no_gluten: This action is for serving a gluten-free sandwich to a child who is allergic to gluten. The preconditions are that the child is allergic to gluten, waiting at a place, and there is a gluten-free sandwich on a tray at the same place. The effect is that the sandwich is no longer on the tray and the child is served.\n\n5. serve_sandwich: This action is for serving a sandwich to a child who is not allergic to gluten. The preconditions are that the child is not allergic to gluten, waiting at a place, and there is a sandwich on a tray at the same place. The effect is that the sandwich is no longer on the tray and the child is served.\n\n6. move_tray: This action allows a tray to be moved from one place to another. The precondition is that the tray is at the starting place. The effect is that the tray is no longer at the starting place and is now at the destination place.\n\n</domain_nl>\n\n- The natural language description of the problem:\n<problem_nl>\nYou are tasked with preparing and serving sandwiches to eleven children, some of whom have gluten allergies, using a set of actions that involve making sandwiches, placing them on trays, moving trays, and serving the sandwiches.\n\nInitially:\n- There are three trays, tray1, tray2, and tray3, all located in the kitchen.\n- There are eleven portions of bread, bread1 through bread11, all in the kitchen.\n- There are eleven portions of content, content1 through content11, all in the kitchen.\n- Bread portions bread2, bread7, bread8, and bread9 are gluten-free.\n- Content portions content2, content6, content7, and content9 are gluten-free.\n- Child2, child4, child7, and child8 are allergic to gluten.\n- Child1, child3, child5, child6, child9, child10, and child11 are not allergic to gluten.\n- Child1, child2, child3, and child10 are waiting at table1.\n- Child5, child6, child8, child9, and child11 are waiting at table2.\n- Child4 is waiting at table3.\n- There are fifteen sandwiches, sandw1 through sandw15, which do not exist yet.\n\nYour goal is to ensure that:\n- All eleven children, child1 through child11, are served with a sandwich that they are not allergic to.\n</problem_nl>\n\n- The PDDL problem template:\n<problem_pddl>\n;

The domain includes actions for making sandwiches with and without gluten, placing sandwiches on trays, moving trays between places, and serving the sandwiches to the children.\n\nThe actions defined in this domain include:\n\n1. make_sandwich_no_gluten: This action is for making a gluten-free sandwich. The preconditions for this action are that there must be gluten-free bread and gluten-free content available in the kitchen, and the sandwich must not already exist. The effect of this action is that the gluten-free bread and content are no longer available in the kitchen, and a gluten-free sandwich is now available in the kitchen.\n\n2. make_sandwich: This action is for making a regular sandwich that may contain gluten. The preconditions are that there must be bread and content available in the kitchen, and the sandwich must not already exist. The effect of this action is that the bread and content are no longer available in the kitchen, and a sandwich is now available in the kitchen.\n\n3. put_on_tray: This action is for placing a sandwich on a tray. The preconditions are that the sandwich must be in the kitchen and the tray must be at the kitchen. The effect is that the sandwich is no longer in the kitchen and is now on the tray.\n\n4. serve_sandwich_no_gluten: This action is for serving a gluten-free sandwich to a child who is allergic to gluten. The preconditions are that the child is allergic to gluten, waiting at a place, and there is a gluten-free sandwich on a tray at the same place. The effect is that the sandwich is no longer on the tray and the child is served.\n\n5. serve_sandwich: This action is for serving a sandwich to a child who is not allergic to gluten. The preconditions are that the child is not allergic to gluten, waiting at a place, and there is a sandwich on a tray at the same place. The effect is that the sandwich is no longer on the tray and the child is served.\n\n6. move_tray: This action allows a tray to be moved from one place to another. The precondition is that the tray is at the starting place. The effect is that the tray is no longer at the starting place and is now at the destination place.\n\n</domain_nl>",

Here are:
- The natural language description of the domain:
<domain_nl>
The child-snack domain is designed to plan the preparation and serving of sandwiches to children, some of whom have gluten allergies. The domain includes actions for making sandwiches with and without gluten, placing sandwiches on trays, moving trays between places, and serving the sandwiches to the children.

The actions defined in this domain include:

1. make_sandwich_no_gluten: This action is for making a gluten-free sandwich. The preconditions for this action are that there must be gluten-free bread and gluten-free content available in the kitchen, and the sandwich must not already exist. The effect of this action is that the gluten-free bread and content are no longer available in the kitchen, and a gluten-free sandwich is now available in the kitchen.

2. make_sandwich: This action is for making a regular sandwich that may contain gluten. The preconditions are that there must be bread and content available in the kitchen, and the sandwich must not already exist. The effect of this action is that the bread and content are no longer available in the kitchen, and a sandwich is now available in the kitchen.

3. put_on_tray: This action is for placing a sandwich on a tray. The preconditions are that the sandwich must be in the kitchen and the tray must be at the kitchen. The effect is that the sandwich is no longer in the kitchen and is now on the tray.

4. serve_sandwich_no_gluten: This action is for serving a gluten-free sandwich to a child who is allergic to gluten. The preconditions are that the child is allergic to gluten, waiting at a place, and there is a gluten-free sandwich on a tray at the same place. The effect is that the sandwich is no longer on the tray and the child is served.

5. serve_sandwich: This action is for serving a sandwich to a child who is not allergic to gluten.

- The natural language description of the problem:
<problem_nl>
You are tasked with preparing and serving sandwiches to twelve children, some of whom have gluten allergies, using a set of actions that involve making sandwiches, placing them on trays, moving trays, and serving the sandwiches.

Initially:
- There are three trays, tray1, tray2, and tray3, all located in the kitchen.
- There are twelve portions of bread, bread1 through bread12, all in the kitchen.
- There are twelve portions of content, content1 through content12, all in the kitchen.
- Bread portions bread3, bread4, bread5, and bread11 are gluten-free.
- Content portions content2, content5, content9, and content12 are gluten-free.
- Child1, child3, child5, and child12 are allergic to gluten.
- Child2, child4, child6, child7, child8, child9, child10, and child11 are not allergic to gluten.
- Child1 and child4 are waiting at table2.
- Child2, child3, child9, child11, and child12 are waiting at table1.
- Child5, child6, child7, and child10 are waiting at table3.
- Child8 is waiting at table2.
- There are sixteen sandwiches, sandw1 through sandw16, which do not exist yet.

Your goal is to ensure that:
- All twelve children, child1 through child12, are served with a sandwich that they are not allergic to.

Here are:
- The natural language description of the domain:
<domain_nl>
The child-snack domain is designed to plan the preparation and serving of sandwiches to children, some of whom have gluten allergies. The domain includes actions for making sandwiches with and without gluten, placing sandwiches on trays, moving trays between places, and serving the sandwiches to the children.

The actions defined in this domain include:

1. make_sandwich_no_gluten: This action is for making a gluten-free sandwich. The preconditions for this action are that there must be gluten-free bread and gluten-free content available in the kitchen, and the sandwich must not already exist. The effect of this action is that the gluten-free bread and content are no longer available in the kitchen, and a gluten-free sandwich is now available in the kitchen.

2. make_sandwich: This action is for making a regular sandwich that may contain gluten. The preconditions are that there must be bread and content available in the kitchen, and the sandwich must not already exist. The effect of this action is that the bread and content are no longer available in the kitchen, and a sandwich is now available in the kitchen.

3. put_on_tray: This action is for placing a sandwich on a tray. The preconditions are that the sandwich must be in the kitchen and the tray must be at the kitchen. The effect is that the sandwich is no longer in the kitchen and is now on the tray.

4. serve_sandwich_no_gluten: This action is for serving a gluten-free sandwich to a child who is allergic to gluten. The preconditions are that the child is allergic to gluten, waiting at a place, and there is a gluten-free sandwich on a tray at the same place. The effect is that the sandwich is no longer on the tray and the child is served.

5. serve_sandwich: This action is for serving a sandwich to a child who is not allergic to gluten. The preconditions are that the child is not allergic to gluten, waiting at a place, and there is a sandwich on a tray at the same place. The effect is that the sandwich is no longer on the tray and the child is served.

6. move_tray: This action allows a tray to be moved from one place to another. The precondition is that the tray is at the starting place. The effect is that the tray is no longer at the starting place and is now at the destination place.
