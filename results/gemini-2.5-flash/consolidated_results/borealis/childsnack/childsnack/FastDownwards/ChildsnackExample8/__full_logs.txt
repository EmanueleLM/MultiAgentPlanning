- The natural language description of the domain:
<domain_nl>
The child-snack domain is designed to plan the preparation and serving of sandwiches to children, some of whom have gluten allergies. The domain includes actions for making sandwiches with and without gluten, placing sandwiches on trays, moving trays between places, and serving the sandwiches to the children.

The actions defined in this domain include:

1. make_sandwich_no_gluten: This action is for making a gluten-free sandwich. The preconditions for this action are that there must be gluten-free bread and gluten-free content available in the kitchen, and the sandwich must not already exist. The effect of this action is that the gluten-free bread and content are no longer available in the kitchen, and a gluten-free sandwich is now available in the kitchen.

2. make_sandwich: This action is for making a regular sandwich that may contain gluten. The preconditions are that there must be bread and content available in the kitchen, and the sandwich must not already exist. The effect of this action is that the bread and content are no longer available in the kitchen, and a sandwich is now available in the kitchen.

3. put_on_tray: This action is for placing a sandwich on a tray. The preconditions are that the sandwich must be in the kitchen and the tray must be at the kitchen. The effect is that the sandwich is no longer in the kitchen and is now on the tray.

4. serve_sandwich_no_gluten: This action is for serving a gluten-free sandwich to a child who is allergic to gluten. The preconditions are that the child is allergic to gluten, waiting at a place, and there is a gluten-free sandwich on a tray at the same place. The effect is that the sandwich is no longer on the tray and the child is served.

5. serve_sandwich: This action is for serving a sandwich to a child who is not allergic to gluten. The preconditions are that the child is not allergic to gluten, waiting at a place, and there is a sandwich on a tray at the same place. The effect is that the sandwich is no longer on the tray and the child is served.

6. move_tray: This action allows a tray to be moved from one place to another. The precondition is that the tray is at the starting place. The effect is that the tray is no longer at the starting place and is now at the destination place.

- The natural language description of the problem:
<problem_nl>
You are tasked with preparing and serving sandwiches to ten children, some of whom have gluten allergies, using a set of actions that involve making sandwiches, placing them on trays, moving trays, and serving the sandwiches.

Initially:
- There are three trays, tray1, tray2, and tray3, all located in the kitchen.
- There are ten portions of bread, bread1 through bread10, all in the kitchen.
- There are ten portions of content, content1 through content10, all in the kitchen.
- Bread portions bread6, bread2, bread8, and bread7 are gluten-free.
- Content portions content5, content6, content2, and content8 are gluten-free.
- Child9, child2, child3, and child7 are allergic to gluten.
- Child1, child10, child4, child5, child6, and child8 are not allergic to gluten.
- Child1, child2, child3, child7, and child10 are waiting at table1.
- Child4 is waiting at table3.
- Child5, child6, and child8 are waiting at table2.
- Child9 is waiting at table2.
- There are thirteen sandwiches, sandw1 through sandw13, which do not exist yet.

Your goal is to ensure that:
- All ten children, child1 through child10, are served with a sandwich that they are not allergic to.
