This plan details the sequence of actions for Robot 1 and Robot 2 to paint the floor tiles according to the specified pattern, minimizing the total cost.

The grid coordinates are read as (Row, Column), where Row 5 is the bottom and Row 0 is the top. Initial state: Robot 1 (White) at (4, 2); Robot 2 (Black) at (5, 3).
