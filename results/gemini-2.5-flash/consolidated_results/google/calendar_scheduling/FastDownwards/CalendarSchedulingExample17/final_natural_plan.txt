This sequence of instructions outlines the process of finding the earliest common 30-minute time slot for Margaret, Donna, and Helen on Monday, respecting all individual and overall scheduling constraints (9:00 to 17:00, and Helen's strict preference to meet before 13:30).

The process advances sequentially until the first valid time slot is identified.

**Action Plan:**

1.  **Check Time Slot 1 (9:00–9:30):** The system checks availability at 9:00. Margaret and Helen are unavailable. Advance the current time pointer to 9:30.
2.  **Check Time Slot 2 (9:30–10:00):** The system checks availability at 9:30. Margaret is unavailable. Advance the current time pointer to 10:00.
3.  **Check Time Slot 3 (10:00–10:30):** The system checks availability at 10:00. Helen is unavailable. Advance the current time pointer to 10:30.
4.  **Check Time Slot 4 (10:30–11:00):** The system checks availability at 10:30. Margaret and Helen are unavailable. Advance the current time pointer to 11:00.
5.  **Check Time Slot 5 (11:00–11:30):** The system checks availability at 11:00. Helen is unavailable. Advance the current time pointer to 11:30.
6.  **Check Time Slot 6 (11:30–12:00):** The system checks availability at 11:30. Margaret is unavailable. Advance the current time pointer to 12:00.
7.  **Schedule Meeting (12:00–12:30):** The system verifies that Margaret, Donna, and Helen are all available, and Helen's preference (meeting must start before 13:30) is satisfied. Schedule the 30-minute meeting starting at 12:00.

**Final Scheduled Time:** 12:00 to 12:30.
