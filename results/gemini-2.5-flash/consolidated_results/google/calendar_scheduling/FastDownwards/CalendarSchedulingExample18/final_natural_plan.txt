Based on the analysis of the PDDL domain, problem, and plan, the following sequence of actions achieves the scheduling goal:

**Action 1: Schedule the Meeting (16:00 to 16:30)**

Schedule the 30-minute meeting in the slot **16:00 to 16:30** on Monday.

*(Note: This selected slot, T15, is mutually available for Brian, Billy, and Patricia, but it violates Billy's stated preference to avoid meetings after 15:30, resulting in a minor preference violation cost.)*
