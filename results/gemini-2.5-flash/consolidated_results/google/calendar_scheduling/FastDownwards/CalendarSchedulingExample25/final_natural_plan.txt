This plan details the steps required by the orchestrator to find a mutually available 1-hour time slot for Anthony, Pamela, and Zachary on Monday, respecting all individual constraints.

1.  **Anthony checks availability:** Anthony verifies that he is available for the 1-hour slot starting at 13:30 and ending at 14:30. (Slot S9)
2.  **Pamela checks availability and constraints:** Pamela verifies that she is available for the 1-hour slot starting at 13:30 and ending at 14:30. This slot satisfies her preference constraint that the meeting must not occur after 14:30. (Slot S9)
3.  **Zachary checks availability:** Zachary verifies that he is available for the 1-hour slot starting at 13:30 and ending at 14:30. (Slot S9)
4.  **Orchestrator schedules meeting:** Since Anthony, Pamela, and Zachary are all confirmed available, the meeting is scheduled for the 1-hour slot from **13:30 to 14:30**.
