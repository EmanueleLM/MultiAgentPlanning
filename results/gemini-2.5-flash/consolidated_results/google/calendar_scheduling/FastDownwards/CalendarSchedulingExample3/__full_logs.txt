PROBLEM
------------------------------
You are an expert at scheduling meetings. You are given a few constraints on the existing schedule of each participant, the meeting duration, and possibly some preferences on the meeting time. Note there exists a solution that works with existing schedule of every participant. Here are a few example tasks and solutions:

TASK: You need to schedule a meeting for Michelle, Steven and Jerry for one hour between the work hours of 9:00 to 17:00 on Monday. 

Here are the existing schedules for everyone during the day: 
Michelle has meetings on Monday during 11:00 to 12:00; 
Steven has blocked their calendar on Monday during 9:00 to 9:30, 11:30 to 12:00, 13:30 to 14:00, 15:30 to 16:00; 
Jerry has blocked their calendar on Monday during 9:00 to 9:30, 10:00 to 11:00, 11:30 to 12:30, 13:00 to 14:30, 15:30 to 16:00, 16:30 to 17:00; 

Find a time that works for everyone's schedule and constraints.

NATURAL-PLAN sas_plan_3
------------------------------
The following sequence of actions translates the PDDL plan into human-readable instructions, fulfilling the goal of scheduling the 1-hour meeting (60 minutes) on Monday between 09:00 and 17:00.

1.  **Schedule Meeting:** The orchestrator schedules the required 1-hour meeting for Michelle, Steven, and Jerry.
    *   **Action:** `(schedule-meeting t1430 t1500 t1530)`
    *   **Time Slot:** Monday, 14:30 to 15:30.
    *   **Duration:** 60 minutes.
================================================================================


PROBLEM
------------------------------
You are an expert at scheduling meetings. You are given a few constraints on the existing schedule of each participant, the meeting duration, and possibly some preferences on the meeting time. Note there exists a solution that works with existing schedule of every participant. Here are a few example tasks and solutions:

TASK: You need to schedule a meeting for Raymond, Billy and Donald for half an hour between the work hours of 9:00 to 17:00 on Monday. 

Here are the existing schedules for everyone during the day: 
Raymond has blocked their calendar on Monday during 9:00 to 9:30, 11:30 to 12:00, 13:00 to 13:30, 15:00 to 15:30; 
Billy has meetings on Monday during 10:00 to 10:30, 12:00 to 13:00, 16:30 to 17:00; 
Donald has meetings on Monday during 9:00 to 9:30, 10:00 to 11:00, 12:00 to 13:00, 14:00 to 14:30, 16:00 to 17:00; 

Billy would like to avoid more meetings on Monday after 15:00. Find a time that works for everyone's schedule and constraints.

1. **Schedule Meeting:** Schedule the 30-minute meeting for Raymond, Billy, and Donald on Monday, starting at 11:00 and ending at 11:30.
================================================================================


PROBLEM
------------------------------
You are an expert at scheduling meetings. You are given a few constraints on the existing schedule of each participant, the meeting duration, and possibly some preferences on the meeting time. Note there exists a solution that works with existing schedule of every participant. Here are a few example tasks and solutions:

TASK: You need to schedule a meeting for Roy, Kathryn and Amy for half an hour between the work hours of 9:00 to 17:00 on Monday. 

Here are the existing schedules for everyone during the day: 
Roy has blocked their calendar on Monday during 9:00 to 9:30, 10:00 to 10:30, 11:00 to 11:30, 12:30 to 13:00; 
Kathryn has meetings on Monday during 9:30 to 10:00, 16:30 to 17:00; 
Amy has blocked their calendar on Monday during 9:00 to 14:30, 15:00 to 16:00, 16:30 to 17:00; 

Amy would rather not meet on Monday after 15:30. Find a time that works for everyone's schedule and constraints.

Here are a few example tasks and solutions:\n\nTASK: You need to schedule a meeting for Roy, Kathryn and Amy for half an hour between the work hours of 9:00 to 17:00 on Monday. \n\nHere are the existing schedules for everyone during the day: \nRoy has blocked their calendar on Monday during 9:00 to 9:30, 10:00 to 10:30, 11:00 to 11:30, 12:30 to 13:00; \nKathryn has meetings on Monday during 9:30 to 10:00, 16:30 to 17:00; \nAmy has blocked their calendar on Monday during 9:00 to 14:30, 15:00 to 16:00, 16:30 to 17:00; \n\nAmy would rather not meet on Monday after 15:30. Find a time that works for everyone's schedule and constraints. \nSOLUTION: ",

NATURAL-PLAN sas_plan_1
------------------------------
Based on the integrated scheduling constraints and the optimal plan found by the orchestrator, here is the sequence of actions to schedule the meeting:

1.  **Schedule Meeting:** The orchestrator confirms the common available 30-minute time slot of 14:30 (2:30 PM) for Roy, Kathryn, and Amy. This slot respects all availability constraints and satisfies Amy's preference (starting at 15:30 or earlier).
    *   **Action:** Schedule the 30-minute meeting to start at **14:30** (2:30 PM) on Monday.
================================================================================


PROBLEM
------------------------------
You are an expert at scheduling meetings. You are given a few constraints on the existing schedule of each participant, the meeting duration, and possibly some preferences on the meeting time. Note there exists a solution that works with existing schedule of every participant. Here are a few example tasks and solutions:

TASK: You need to schedule a meeting for Arthur, Michael and Samantha for one hour between the work hours of 9:00 to 17:00 on Monday. 

Here are the existing schedules for everyone during the day: 
Arthur is busy on Monday during 9:00 to 9:30, 10:30 to 12:00, 16:00 to 17:00; 
Michael has meetings on Monday during 13:00 to 13:30, 14:00 to 14:30; 
Samantha has blocked their calendar on Monday during 10:30 to 11:00, 12:00 to 15:00, 15:30 to 17:00; 

Find a time that works for everyone's schedule and constraints.
