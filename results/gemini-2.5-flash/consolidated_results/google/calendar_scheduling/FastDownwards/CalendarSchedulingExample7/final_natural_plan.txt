The PDDL plan translates into the following sequence of instructions, fulfilling the goal of finding a common, preferred 30-minute meeting slot:

1.  **Schedule the Meeting:** Schedule the 30-minute meeting for Heather, Nicholas, and Zachary to start at **12:00** (running until 12:30). This slot is confirmed to be available for all participants and respects Zachary's preference not to meet after 14:00.
