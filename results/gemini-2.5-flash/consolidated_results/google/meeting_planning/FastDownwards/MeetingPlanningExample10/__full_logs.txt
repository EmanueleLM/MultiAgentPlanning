This schedule details the sequence of actions required to successfully meet Jessica for the minimum required 90 minutes.

| Step | Action | Details | Time Constraints |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 1. | **Wait for Departure** | The traveler, having arrived at Haight-Ashbury (Location A) at 9:00 AM, waits for the appropriate time to depart to meet Jessica. | Start: 9:00 AM (T0900) |
| 2. | **Travel HA to SD** | Travel from Haight-Ashbury (Location A) to the Sunset District (Location B, where Jessica is). | Start: 3:00 PM (T1500); End: 3:15 PM (T1515). (Duration: 15 minutes) |
| 3. | **Meet Jessica** | Begin the scheduled meeting with Jessica at the Sunset District (Location B). The meeting lasts exactly 90 minutes. | Start: 3:15 PM (T1515); End: 4:45 PM (T1645). (Duration: 90 minutes) |

**Final Outcome:** The meeting is successfully completed at 4:45 PM.

------------------------------
Based on the PDDL plan and the temporal constraints defined in the specification, here is the sequence of human-readable actions required to achieve the goal:

1.  **Wait until departure**
    *   **Activity:** Wait at Fisherman's Wharf (FW).
    *   **Start Time:** 9:00 AM
    *   **End Time:** 2:04 PM
    *   **Duration:** 304 minutes (5 hours and 4 minutes).

2.  **Travel from Fisherman's Wharf to Nob Hill (FW -> NH)**
    *   **Activity:** Travel to Nob Hill to meet Kenneth.
    *   **Start Time:** 2:04 PM
    *   **End Time:** 2:15 PM (Arriving exactly at Kenneth's availability start time).
    *   **Duration:** 11 minutes.

3.  **Meet Kenneth for 90 minutes**
    *   **Activity:** Meet Kenneth at Nob Hill, satisfying the minimum required duration.
    *   **Start Time:** 2:15 PM
    *   **End Time:** 3:45 PM
    *   **Duration:** 90 minutes (1 hour and 30 minutes).

NATURAL-PLAN sas_plan_6
------------------------------
This plan details the necessary sequence of actions, starting at 9:00 AM (T=0) at the Richmond District, to successfully meet John for 75 minutes, respecting all time constraints.

The total time elapsed at the conclusion of the goal is 450 minutes (4:30 PM).

| Step | Action | Description | Duration | Start Time (T) | End Time (T) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 1 | **(travel\_rd\_nb)** | Travel from Richmond District to North Beach. | 17 minutes | 9:00 AM (0) | 9:17 AM (17) |
| 2 | **(wait\_to\_start\_window)** | Wait at North Beach until the earliest available meeting time (3:15 PM). | 358 minutes | 9:17 AM (17) | 3:15 PM (375) |
| 3 | **(meet\_john\_75min)** | Commence the required 75-minute meeting with John, starting exactly at 3:15 PM. | 75 minutes | 3:15 PM (375) | 4:30 PM (450) |

NATURAL-PLAN sas_plan_9
------------------------------
Based on the provided plan, domain definition, and problem specification, here is the sequence of human-readable actions required to achieve the goal:

The planning starts at Union Square at 9:00 AM (T=540 minutes).

| Step | Action | Duration | Start Time | End Time | Details |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **1** | **Travel Union Square to Nob Hill** | 9 minutes | 9:00 AM | 9:09 AM | Travel from the current location (Union Square) to Nob Hill, the meeting location. |
| **2** | **Wait for Mary's Availability** | 171 minutes | 9:09 AM | 12:00 PM | Wait at Nob Hill until Mary's scheduled availability begins at 12:00 PM (T=720). |
| **3** | **Meet Mary (Minimum Duration)** | 75 minutes | 12:00 PM | 1:15 PM | Conduct the meeting with Mary for the required minimum duration of 75 minutes. |

**Goal achieved:** The meeting is completed, respecting the minimum duration (75 minutes) and occurring entirely within Mary's availability window (12:00 PM to 4:15 PM). The total time elapsed is 255 minutes (ending at 1:15 PM).

NATURAL-PLAN sas_plan_3
------------------------------
This schedule successfully meets the required constraints, starting at 9:00 AM at Golden Gate Park and meeting James within his 10:15 AM to 1:30 PM availability window for the minimum 15 minutes.

Here is the sequence of human-readable actions:

1.  **Travel from Golden Gate Park (GGP) to Marina District (MD):** The journey takes 16 minutes, starting at 9:00 AM and arriving at 9:16 AM.
2.  **Wait at Marina District (MD):** Wait 59 minutes (from 9:16 AM) until James' availability window opens, reaching a ready time of 10:15 AM.
3.  **Meet James:** Conduct the meeting at the Marina District for the required minimum duration of 15 minutes, starting at 10:15 AM and concluding at 10:30 AM.
