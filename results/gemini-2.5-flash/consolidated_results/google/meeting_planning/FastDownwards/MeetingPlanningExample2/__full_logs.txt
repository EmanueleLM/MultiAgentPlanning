------------------------------
This schedule details the sequence of actions required to successfully meet Jessica for the minimum required 90 minutes.

| Step | Action | Details | Time Constraints |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 1. | **Wait for Departure** | The traveler, having arrived at Haight-Ashbury (Location A) at 9:00 AM, waits for the appropriate time to depart to meet Jessica. | Start: 9:00 AM (T0900) |
| 2. | **Travel HA to SD** | Travel from Haight-Ashbury (Location A) to the Sunset District (Location B, where Jessica is). | Start: 3:00 PM (T1500); End: 3:15 PM (T1515). (Duration: 15 minutes) |
| 3. | **Meet Jessica** | Begin the scheduled meeting with Jessica at the Sunset District (Location B). The meeting lasts exactly 90 minutes. | Start: 3:15 PM (T1515); End: 4:45 PM (T1645). (Duration: 90 minutes) |

**Final Outcome:** The meeting is successfully completed at 4:45 PM.
