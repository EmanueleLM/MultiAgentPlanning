Based on the provided specification, PDDL artifacts, and the solving plan, here is the sequence of human-readable instructions for the 9-day trip:

This plan outlines the required city allocation (Oslo: 1 day, Dublin: 3 days, Valencia: 5 days) and the travel sequence (Oslo $\rightarrow$ Dublin $\rightarrow$ Valencia) to satisfy the 9-day limit and the constraint that Valencia must span Days 5 through 9.

| Step | Action Description | Duration / Temporal Span |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 1 | **Allocate durations:** Determine the required duration split for the first two cities, assigning 1 day to Oslo and 3 days to Dublin. | Total O+D allocation: 4 days. |
| 2 | **Visit Oslo:** Begin the trip by staying in Oslo. | 1 day (Day 1) |
| 3 | **Travel to Dublin:** Take the direct flight connection from Oslo to Dublin. | Travel |
| 4 | **Visit Dublin:** Stay in Dublin for the allocated duration. | 3 days (Days 2 through 4) |
| 5 | **Travel to Valencia:** Take the direct flight connection from Dublin to Valencia. | Travel |
| 6 | **Visit Valencia:** Complete the trip by staying in Valencia for the required duration. | 5 days (Days 5 through 9) |
