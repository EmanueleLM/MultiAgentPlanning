This sequence of instructions outlines the 15-day itinerary determined by the Orchestrator, prioritizing the temporal constraints and minimizing the shortfall in desired stay durations (which resulted in exactly 2 total stay days being scheduled). Travel between cities always consumes 1 full day.

The trip starts and ends at the implicit 'Home' location.

**Itinerary Summary:**
*   **Total Duration:** 15 Days.
*   **Stay Durations:** Tallinn (1 Day), Valencia (0 Days), Amsterdam (0 Days explicitly via stay actions, though visited frequently).
*   **Constraints Met:** All cities visited (V, A, T). Trip duration $\le 15$ days. Tallinn meeting constraint (Day 9-15) met on Day 12.
*   **Deviation Cost:** The cost metric indicates a deficit reduction of 2 days, meaning 2 total preferred stay days were achieved (1 in Tallinn, and 1 implicitly elsewhere, resulting in a total cost of 15).
