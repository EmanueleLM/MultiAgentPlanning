PROBLEM
------------------------------
You plan to visit 3 European cities for 11 days in total. You only take direct flights to commute between cities. You plan to stay in Venice for 6 days. You would like to visit Dubrovnik for 4 days. You would like to visit Istanbul for 3 days.

Here are the cities that have direct flights:
from Dubrovnik to Istanbul, Istanbul and Venice.

Find a trip plan of visiting the cities for 11 days by taking direct flights to commute between them.

Ensure travel actions (flights) correctly increment the total time counter (e.g., 1 day per flight).\n2. Define a 'stay' action for each city that increments the total time counter (1 day per stay action) and the city-specific stay counter.\n3.

NATURAL-PLAN sas_plan_8
------------------------------
This trip plan outlines the required movement and stays over the maximum 11-day duration, starting at Day 1 (T0) and concluding at Day 11 (T11). Travel time for each direct flight is 1 day.

| Step | Action Description | Duration | Day(s) of Trip | Current Location (End of Day) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 1 | **Stay in Dubrovnik** (Day 1 of 4 required days). | 1 Day | Day 1 | Dubrovnik |
| 2 | **Fly from Dubrovnik to Istanbul.** | 1 Day | Day 2 | Istanbul |
| 3 | **Fly from Istanbul to Dubrovnik.** | 1 Day | Day 3 | Dubrovnik |
| 4 | **Fly from Dubrovnik to Istanbul.** | 1 Day | Day 4 | Istanbul |
| 5 | **Fly from Istanbul to Dubrovnik.** | 1 Day | Day 5 | Dubrovnik |
| 6 | **Fly from Dubrovnik to Istanbul.** | 1 Day | Day 6 | Istanbul |
| 7 | **Fly from Istanbul to Dubrovnik.** | 1 Day | Day 7 | Dubrovnik |
