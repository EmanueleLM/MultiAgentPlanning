This sequence of instructions outlines the logistics plan to move the crates (`crate0`, `crate1`, `crate2`) to their required destination pallets (`pallet0`, `pallet2`, `pallet1`). Each action is assumed to take one unit of time (T).

### Logistics Plan

| :---: | :--- | :--- |
| 1 | **DRIVE** | Truck T2 drives from Depot D0 to Depot D1. |
| 2 | **DRIVE** | Truck T1 drives from Depot D0 to Depot D2. |
| 3 | **LIFT** | Hoist H3 at Distributor R0 lifts Crate C2, removing it from Crate C1. |
| 4 | **LOAD** | Hoist H3 at Distributor R0 loads Crate C2 onto Truck T0. |
| 5 | **DRIVE** | Truck T0 drives from Distributor R0 to Depot D1. |
| 6 | **UNLOAD** | Hoist H1 at Depot D1 unloads Crate C2 from Truck T0. |
| 7 | **DROP** | Hoist H1 at Depot D1 drops Crate C2 onto Pallet P1. *(Crate 2 Goal Reached)* |
| 8 | **LIFT** | Hoist H3 at Distributor R0 lifts Crate C1, removing it from Pallet P3. |
| 9 | **LIFT** | Hoist H2 at Depot D2 lifts Crate C0, removing it from Pallet P2. |
| 10 | **LOAD** | Hoist H2 at Depot D2 loads Crate C0 onto Truck T1. |
| 11 | **DRIVE** | Truck T1 drives from Depot D2 to Depot D0. |
| 12 | **UNLOAD** | Hoist H0 at Depot D0 unloads Crate C0 from Truck T1. |
| 13 | **DRIVE** | Truck T0 drives from Depot D1 to Depot D2. |
| 14 | **DROP** | Hoist H0 at Depot D0 drops Crate C0 onto Pallet P0. *(Crate 0 Goal Reached)* |
| 15 | **DRIVE** | Truck T0 drives from Depot D2 to Distributor R0. |
| 16 | **LOAD** | Hoist H3 at Distributor R0 loads Crate C1 onto Truck T0. |
| 17 | **DRIVE** | Truck T0 drives from Distributor R0 to Depot D2. |
| 18 | **UNLOAD** | Hoist H2 at Depot D2 unloads Crate C1 from Truck T0. |
