This is a step-by-step translation of the logistics plan into human-readable instructions, focusing on moving crates to achieve the required stacking arrangement.

The goal is to achieve: Crate C0 on Pallet P3 (at Distributor D0), Crate C1 on Crate C2, and Crate C2 on Pallet P2 (both at Depot D2).

### Logistics Execution Plan

| Step | Action Type | Details |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 1 | **Drive Truck** | Truck T1 drives from Depot 2 to Distributor 0. |
| 2 | **Lift Crate** | Hoist H2 (at D2) lifts Crate C2 from Crate C0. |
| 3 | **Load Crate** | Hoist H2 loads Crate C2 into Truck T0 (at D2). |
| 4 | **Lift Crate** | Hoist H2 lifts Crate C0 from Pallet P2 (at D2). |
| 5 | **Load Crate** | Hoist H2 loads Crate C0 into Truck T0 (at D2). |
| 6 | **Unload Crate** | Hoist H2 unloads Crate C2 from Truck T0 (at D2). (H2 is now holding C2) |
| 7 | **Drive Truck** | Truck T0 (carrying C0) drives from Depot 2 to Distributor 0. |
| 8 | **Unload Crate** | Hoist H3 (at D0) unloads Crate C0 from Truck T0. (H3 is now holding C0) |
| 9 | **Drop Crate** | Hoist H3 drops Crate C0 onto Pallet P3 (at D0). |
| 10 | **Drop Crate** | Hoist H2 (at D2) drops Crate C2 onto Pallet P2. (Crate C2 is now correctly positioned on P2) |
| 11 | **Lift Crate** | Hoist H1 (at D1) lifts Crate C1 from Pallet P1. |
| 12 | **Load Crate** | Hoist H1 loads Crate C1 into Truck T2 (at D1). |
| 13 | **Drive Truck** | Truck T2 (carrying C1) drives from Depot 1 to Depot 2. |
| 14 | **Unload Crate** | Hoist H2 (at D2) unloads Crate C1 from Truck T2. (H2 is now holding C1) |
| 15 | **Drop Crate** | Hoist H2 drops Crate C1 onto Crate C2 (at D2). (Final Goal State achieved) |
