This logistics plan details the movements of trucks and the handling of crates using hoists to achieve the final required stacking configuration: Crate0 on Crate1, Crate1 on Pallet0, and Crate2 on Pallet2.

The process involves Truck T2, Hoist H0 (at Depot0), and Hoist H2 (at Depot2).

### Logistics Plan

| Step | Action Type | Location | Details |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 1 | **Drive** | Depot2 $\rightarrow$ Depot0 | Truck T2 drives from Depot2 to Depot0. |
| 2 | **Lift** | Depot0 | Hoist H0 lifts Crate C2, removing it from Crate C0. |
| 3 | **Load** | Depot0 | Hoist H0 loads Crate C2 into Truck T2. |
| 4 | **Lift** | Depot0 | Hoist H0 lifts Crate C0, removing it from Pallet P0. |
| 5 | **Load** | Depot0 | Hoist H0 loads Crate C0 into Truck T2. (T2 now holds C0 and C2). |
| 6 | **Lift** | Depot2 | Hoist H2 lifts Crate C1 from Pallet P2. |
| 7 | **Drive** | Depot0 $\rightarrow$ Depot2 | Truck T2 (carrying C0, C2) drives from Depot0 to Depot2. |
| 8 | **Load** | Depot2 | Hoist H2 loads the already lifted Crate C1 into Truck T2. (T2 now holds C0, C1, and C2). |
| 9 | **Unload** | Depot2 | Hoist H2 unloads Crate C2 from Truck T2, taking possession of it. |
| 10 | **Drop** | Depot2 | Hoist H2 drops Crate C2 onto Pallet P2. (Goal: C2 on P2 achieved). |
| 11 | **Drive** | Depot2 $\rightarrow$ Depot0 | Truck T2 (carrying C0, C1) drives from Depot2 to Depot0. |
| 12 | **Unload** | Depot0 | Hoist H0 unloads Crate C1 from Truck T2, taking possession of it. |
| 13 | **Drop** | Depot0 | Hoist H0 drops Crate C1 onto Pallet P0. (Goal: C1 on P0 achieved). |
| 14 | **Unload** | Depot0 | Hoist H0 unloads Crate C0 from Truck T2, taking possession of it. |
| 15 | **Drop** | Depot0 | Hoist H0 drops Crate C0 onto Crate C1. (Goal: C0 on C1 achieved). |

**Final Configuration Check:**
*   Crate0 is on Crate1 (at Depot0).
*   Crate1 is on Pallet0 (at Depot0).
*   Crate2 is on Pallet2 (at Depot2).
