This plan outlines the sequence of actions required to move and stack the specified crates according to the final location requirements.

The initial state is:
*   Crate 1 is on Crate 0, which is on Pallet 3, all at **Distributor 0**.
*   Crate 2 is on Pallet 1 at **Depot 1**.
*   Goal: Crate 0 on Pallet 0 (Depot 0), Crate 1 on Pallet 2 (Depot 2), Crate 2 on Pallet 3 (Distributor 0).

The required steps are:

1.  **Truck 2** drives from Distributor 0 to Depot 0.
2.  **Truck 0** drives from Distributor 0 to Depot 1.
3.  **Hoist 3** at Distributor 0 lifts **Crate 1** from Crate 0.
4.  **Hoist 1** at Depot 1 lifts **Crate 2** from Pallet 1.
5.  **Hoist 1** loads **Crate 2** onto **Truck 0** at Depot 1.
6.  **Truck 0** drives from Depot 1 to Distributor 0. (Carrying Crate 2)
7.  **Hoist 3** loads **Crate 1** onto **Truck 0** at Distributor 0. (Truck 0 now carries Crate 2 and Crate 1)
8.  **Hoist 3** lifts **Crate 0** from Pallet 3 at Distributor 0.
9.  **Hoist 3** loads **Crate 0** onto **Truck 0** at Distributor 0. (Truck 0 now carries Crate 2, Crate 1, and Crate 0)
10. **Hoist 3** unloads **Crate 2** from **Truck 0** at Distributor 0. (Hoist 3 holds Crate 2)
11. **Truck 0** drives from Distributor 0 to Depot 0. (Carrying Crate 0 and Crate 1)
12. **Hoist 0** unloads **Crate 0** from **Truck 0** at Depot 0. (Hoist 0 holds Crate 0)
13. **Truck 0** drives from Depot 0 to Depot 2. (Carrying Crate 1)
14. **Hoist 2** unloads **Crate 1** from **Truck 0** at Depot 2. (Hoist 2 holds Crate 1)
15. **Hoist 3** drops **Crate 2** onto **Pallet 3** at Distributor 0. (Crate 2 Goal Achieved)
16. **Hoist 0** drops **Crate 0** onto **Pallet 0** at Depot 0. (Crate 0 Goal Achieved)
17. **Hoist 2** drops **Crate 1** onto **Pallet 2** at Depot 2. (Crate 1 Goal Achieved)
