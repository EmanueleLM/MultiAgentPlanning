The following sequence of actions, executed by the logistics team, achieves the required final configuration where Crate 0 is on Pallet 2, Crate 1 is on Pallet 0, and Crate 2 is stacked on Crate 1.

The total duration of the operation involves 17 sequential unit operations (total cost = 17).

### Logistics Execution Plan

1.  **DRIVE:** Truck 2 drives from **Depot 2** to **Depot 1**.
2.  **LIFT:** Hoist 1 (at Depot 1) lifts **Crate 1** off of Pallet 1.
3.  **LOAD:** Hoist 1 loads **Crate 1** into Truck 2 at Depot 1.
4.  **DRIVE:** Truck 2 (carrying Crate 1) drives from **Depot 1** to **Depot 0**.
5.  **UNLOAD:** Hoist 0 (at Depot 0) unloads **Crate 1** from Truck 2.
6.  **DRIVE:** Truck 2 drives from **Depot 0** to **Distributor 0**.
7.  **DROP:** Hoist 0 drops **Crate 1** onto **Pallet 0** at Depot 0. (Crate 1 is now on Pallet 0).
8.  **LIFT:** Hoist 3 (at Distributor 0) lifts **Crate 2** off of Crate 0.
9.  **LOAD:** Hoist 3 loads **Crate 2** into Truck 2 at Distributor 0.
10. **LIFT:** Hoist 3 lifts **Crate 0** off of Pallet 3 at Distributor 0.
11. **LOAD:** Hoist 3 loads **Crate 0** into Truck 2 at Distributor 0. (Truck 2 now carries Crate 0 and Crate 2).
12. **DRIVE:** Truck 2 (carrying Crate 0 and Crate 2) drives from **Distributor 0** to **Depot 0**.
13. **UNLOAD:** Hoist 0 (at Depot 0) unloads **Crate 2** from Truck 2. (Crate 2 is now lifted by Hoist 0).
14. **DRIVE:** Truck 2 (carrying only Crate 0) drives from **Depot 0** to **Depot 2**.
15. **UNLOAD:** Hoist 2 (at Depot 2) unloads **Crate 0** from Truck 2. (Crate 0 is now lifted by Hoist 2).
16. **DROP:** Hoist 2 drops **Crate 0** onto **Pallet 2** at Depot 2. (Crate 0 is now on Pallet 2).
17. **DROP:** Hoist 0 drops **Crate 2** onto **Crate 1** at Depot 0. (Crate 2 is now on Crate 1).

The goal state is successfully reached.
