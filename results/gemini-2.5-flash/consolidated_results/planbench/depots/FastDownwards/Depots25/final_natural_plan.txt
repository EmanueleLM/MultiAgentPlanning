This is the translated sequence of instructions required to achieve the logistics goal.

**Initial State Summary:**
All three crates (crate0, crate1, crate2) are stacked at Depot 2, with crate2 on crate1, crate1 on crate0, and crate0 on pallet2. Truck 2 is initially at Distributor 0. The final goal is to stack crate1 on crate2, which must rest on pallet2, all at Depot 2.
