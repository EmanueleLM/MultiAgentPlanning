This is the step-by-step logistical plan derived from the PDDL solution to move all crates to their designated final positions.

| Step | Action Type | Details | Location | Status/Goal |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 1 | **DRIVE TRUCK** | Direct `truck2` to travel from `depot0` to `depot2`. | DEPOT 0 $\rightarrow$ DEPOT 2 | Preparing for future operations. |
| 2 | **DRIVE TRUCK** | Direct `truck1` to travel from `depot1` to `distributor0`. | DEPOT 1 $\rightarrow$ DISTRIBUTOR 0 | Positioning to collect `crate2`. |
| 3 | **LIFT CRATE** | Use `hoist3` to lift `crate2` from its current surface, `pallet3`. | DISTRIBUTOR 0 | `hoist3` is now lifting `crate2`. |
| 4 | **LOAD CRATE** | Use `hoist3` to load `crate2` into `truck1`. | DISTRIBUTOR 0 | `crate2` is now in `truck1`. |
| 5 | **LIFT CRATE** | Use `hoist0` to lift `crate0` from its current surface, `pallet0`. | DEPOT 0 | `hoist0` is now lifting `crate0`. |
| 6 | **LOAD CRATE** | Use `hoist0` to load `crate0` into `truck0`. | DEPOT 0 | `crate0` is now in `truck0`. |
| 7 | **LIFT CRATE** | Use `hoist1` to lift `crate1` from its current surface, `pallet1`. | DEPOT 1 | `hoist1` is now lifting `crate1`. |
| 8 | **DRIVE TRUCK** | Direct `truck0` (carrying `crate0`) to travel from `depot0` to `depot2`. | DEPOT 0 $\rightarrow$ DEPOT 2 | Moving `crate0` toward its destination. |
| 9 | **UNLOAD CRATE** | Use `hoist2` to unload `crate0` from `truck0`. | DEPOT 2 | `hoist2` is now lifting `crate0`. |
| 10 | **DROP CRATE** | Use `hoist2` to drop `crate0` onto the destination surface, `pallet2`. | DEPOT 2 | **GOAL: crate0 on pallet2 achieved.** |
| 11 | **DRIVE TRUCK** | Direct `truck1` (carrying `crate2`) to travel from `distributor0` back to `depot1`. | DISTRIBUTOR 0 $\rightarrow$ DEPOT 1 | Positioning to load `crate1`. |
| 12 | **LOAD CRATE** | Use `hoist1` to load `crate1` (which it is currently lifting) into `truck1`. | DEPOT 1 | `crate1` and `crate2` are now in `truck1`. |
| 13 | **UNLOAD CRATE** | Use `hoist1` to unload `crate2` from `truck1`. | DEPOT 1 | `hoist1` is now lifting `crate2`. |
| 14 | **DRIVE TRUCK** | Direct `truck1` (carrying `crate1`) to travel from `depot1` to `distributor0`. | DEPOT 1 $\rightarrow$ DISTRIBUTOR 0 | Moving `crate1` toward its destination. |
| 15 | **UNLOAD CRATE** | Use `hoist3` to unload `crate1` from `truck1`. | DISTRIBUTOR 0 | `hoist3` is now lifting `crate1`. |
| 16 | **DROP CRATE** | Use `hoist3` to drop `crate1` onto the destination surface, `pallet3`. | DISTRIBUTOR 0 | **GOAL: crate1 on pallet3 achieved.** |
| 17 | **DROP CRATE** | Use `hoist1` to drop `crate2` onto the destination surface, `pallet1`. | DEPOT 1 | **GOAL: crate2 on pallet1 achieved.** |
