This sequence of actions translates the provided PDDL plan into instructions for the Hoist Operator, strictly following the actions and locations specified in the plan. Note that this plan is highly abstracted and implicitly assumes that all necessary truck movements (DRIVE, LOAD, UNLOAD) occurred to position the crates and pallets correctly at the specified locations between the lifting/dropping steps.

### PDDL Plan Translation

| Step | Agent | PDDL Action | Natural Language Instruction |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **1** | Hoist Operator | `(lift hoist0 crate1 crate0 depot0)` | **LIFT:** Use Hoist 0 at Depot 0 to lift Crate 1 from Crate 0. |
| **2** | Hoist Operator | `(lift hoist1 crate0 pallet0 depot1)` | **LIFT:** Use Hoist 1 at Depot 1 to lift Crate 0 from Pallet 0. |
| **3** | Hoist Operator | `(drop hoist0 crate1 pallet0 depot0)` | **DROP:** Use Hoist 0 at Depot 0 to drop Crate 1 onto Pallet 0. (Goal state achieved for Crate 1 location and stacking.) |
| **4** | Hoist Operator | `(drop hoist1 crate0 pallet3 depot1)` | **DROP:** Use Hoist 1 at Depot 1 to drop Crate 0 onto Pallet 3. (Goal state achieved for Crate 0 stacking.) |

**Total Estimated Cost:** 4 actions.
