This is the step-by-step plan to achieve the goal state (crate1 on crate0, crate0 on crate2, and crate2 on pallet0, all stacked at Depot 0), translated from the PDDL plan.

| Step | Action | Location | Details |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 1 | **DRIVE** | Depot 0 to Depot 1 | Truck 2 drives from Depot 0 to Depot 1. |
| 2 | **LIFT** | Distributor 0 | Hoist 3 lifts Crate 1 from Crate 0. |
| 3 | **DRIVE** | Depot 1 to Distributor 0 | Truck 2 drives from Depot 1 to Distributor 0. |
| 4 | **LOAD** | Distributor 0 | Hoist 3 loads Crate 1 onto Truck 2. |
| 5 | **LIFT** | Distributor 0 | Hoist 3 lifts Crate 0 from Pallet 3. |
| 6 | **LOAD** | Distributor 0 | Hoist 3 loads Crate 0 onto Truck 2. |
| 7 | **LIFT** | Depot 1 | Hoist 1 lifts Crate 2 from Pallet 1. |
| 8 | **LOAD** | Depot 1 | Hoist 1 loads Crate 2 onto Truck 1. |
| 9 | **DRIVE** | Distributor 0 to Depot 0 | Truck 2 (carrying Crate 0 and Crate 1) drives from Distributor 0 to Depot 0. |
| 10 | **DRIVE** | Depot 1 to Depot 0 | Truck 1 (carrying Crate 2) drives from Depot 1 to Depot 0. |
| 11 | **UNLOAD** | Depot 0 | Hoist 0 unloads Crate 2 from Truck 1. |
| 12 | **DROP** | Depot 0 | Hoist 0 drops Crate 2 onto Pallet 0. |
| 13 | **UNLOAD** | Depot 0 | Hoist 0 unloads Crate 0 from Truck 2. |
| 14 | **DROP** | Depot 0 | Hoist 0 drops Crate 0 onto Crate 2. |
| 15 | **UNLOAD** | Depot 0 | Hoist 0 unloads Crate 1 from Truck 2. |
| 16 | **DROP** | Depot 0 | Hoist 0 drops Crate 1 onto Crate 0. |

The required stacking configuration is now complete at Depot 0.
