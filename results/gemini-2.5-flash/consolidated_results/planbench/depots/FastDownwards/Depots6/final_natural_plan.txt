This is the translation of the logistics plan into a sequence of human-readable instructions. Each step represents one unit of time/cost.

**Objective:** Achieve the stacking configuration: Crate 0 on Crate 2, Crate 1 on Pallet 2, and Crate 2 on Pallet 1.

| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |

| 5 | T+5 | Depot 1 | Hoist 1 | Unload Crate 2 from Truck 2 using Hoist 1. (Hoist 1 is now lifting Crate 2) |
| 6 | T+6 | Depot 1 -> Depot 0 | Truck 2 | Drive Truck 2 from Depot 1 to Depot 0. |
| 7 | T+7 | Depot 1 | Hoist 1 | Drop Crate 2 onto Pallet 1 using Hoist 1. (**Goal Substate: Crate 2 is on Pallet 1**) |

| 13 | T+13 | Depot 2 | Hoist 2 | Load Crate 0 onto Truck 2 using Hoist 2. (Truck 2 now carries Crate 0 and Crate 1) |
| 14 | T+14 | Depot 2 | Hoist 2 | Unload Crate 1 from Truck 2 using Hoist 2. (Hoist 2 is now lifting Crate 1) |
| 15 | T+15 | Depot 2 -> Depot 1 | Truck 2 | Drive Truck 2 (carrying Crate 0) from Depot 2 to Depot 1. |
| 16 | T+16 | Depot 1 | Hoist 1 | Unload Crate 0 from Truck 2 using Hoist 1. (Hoist 1 is now lifting Crate 0) |
