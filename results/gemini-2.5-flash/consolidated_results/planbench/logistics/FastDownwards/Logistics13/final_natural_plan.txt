This plan details the steps required to move all packages (`package_0`, `package_1`, and `package_2`) to the final destination, `location_0_1`, utilizing local truck movements within cities and inter-city airplane transport between airports.

### Logistics Execution Plan

| Step | Action | Details |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 1 | **LOAD PACKAGE** | Load `package_1` into `truck_1` at `location_1_1` (in City 1). |
| 2 | **DRIVE TRUCK** | `Truck_1` drives from `location_1_1` to `location_1_0` (Airport in City 1). |
| 3 | **UNLOAD PACKAGE** | Unload `package_1` from `truck_1` at `location_1_0`. (`package_1` is now ready for air transport). |
| 4 | **LOAD PACKAGE** | Load `package_2` into `truck_0` at `location_0_0` (Airport in City 0). |
| 5 | **LOAD PACKAGE** | Load `package_0` into `airplane_0` at `location_1_0`. |
| 6 | **LOAD PACKAGE** | Load `package_1` into `airplane_0` at `location_1_0`. |
| 7 | **FLY AIRPLANE** | `Airplane_0` flies from `location_1_0` (Airport in City 1) to `location_0_0` (Airport in City 0). |
| 8 | **UNLOAD PACKAGE** | Unload `package_0` from `airplane_0` at `location_0_0`. |
| 9 | **LOAD PACKAGE** | Load `package_0` into `truck_0` at `location_0_0`. (`Truck_0` now carries `package_2` and `package_0`). |
| 10 | **UNLOAD PACKAGE** | Unload `package_1` from `airplane_0` at `location_0_0`. |
| 11 | **LOAD PACKAGE** | Load `package_1` into `truck_0` at `location_0_0`. (`Truck_0` now carries all three packages). |
| 12 | **DRIVE TRUCK** | `Truck_0` drives from `location_0_0` to `location_0_1` (the final destination in City 0). |
| 13 | **UNLOAD PACKAGE** | Unload `package_0` from `truck_0` at `location_0_1`. |
| 14 | **UNLOAD PACKAGE** | Unload `package_1` from `truck_0` at `location_0_1`. |
| 15 | **UNLOAD PACKAGE** | Unload `package_2` from `truck_0` at `location_0_1`. |

**Goal State:** All packages (`package_0`, `package_1`, and `package_2`) are successfully delivered to `location_0_1`.
