| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 1 | Truck Master | Load `package_2` onto `truck_1` at `location_1_1` (City 1). |
| 2 | Truck Master | Load `package_0` onto `truck_1` at `location_1_1` (City 1). |
| 3 | Air Traffic Control | Load `package_3` onto `airplane_0` at `location_0_0` (City 0 Airport). |
| 4 | Truck Master | Drive `truck_1` (carrying P0, P2) from `location_1_1` to the airport (`location_1_0`) within City 1. |
| 5 | Truck Master | Unload `package_2` from `truck_1` onto the ground at `location_1_0` (City 1 Airport). |
| 6 | Truck Master | Load `package_1` onto `truck_1` at `location_1_0` (City 1 Airport). |
| 7 | Truck Master | Unload `package_0` from `truck_1` onto the ground at `location_1_0` (City 1 Airport). |
| 8 | Truck Master | Drive `truck_0` from `location_0_1` to the airport (`location_0_0`) within City 0. |
| 9 | Air Traffic Control | Fly `airplane_0` (carrying P3) from `location_0_0` (City 0 Airport) to `location_1_0` (City 1 Airport). |
| 10 | Air Traffic Control | Unload `package_3` from `airplane_0` onto the ground at `location_1_0` (City 1 Airport). |
| 11 | Truck Master | Load `package_3` onto `truck_1` (carrying P1) at `location_1_0` (City 1 Airport). |
| 12 | Truck Master | Drive `truck_1` (carrying P1, P3) from `location_1_0` (Airport) to `location_1_1` within City 1. |
| 13 | Truck Master | Unload `package_3` from `truck_1` at `location_1_1`. (P3 goal achieved) |
| 14 | Truck Master | Unload `package_1` from `truck_1` at `location_1_1`. (P1 goal achieved) |
| 15 | Air Traffic Control | Load `package_2` onto `airplane_0` at `location_1_0` (City 1 Airport). |
| 16 | Air Traffic Control | Load `package_0` onto `airplane_0` at `location_1_0` (City 1 Airport). |
| 17 | Air Traffic Control | Fly `airplane_0` (carrying P0, P2) from `location_1_0` (City 1 Airport) to `location_0_0` (City 0 Airport). |
| 18 | Air Traffic Control | Unload `package_2` from `airplane_0` onto the ground at `location_0_0` (City 0 Airport). |
| 19 | Truck Master | Load `package_2` onto `truck_0` (currently at L0_0) at `location_0_0` (City 0 Airport). |
| 20 | Truck Master | Drive `truck_0` (carrying P2) from `location_0_0` (Airport) to `location_0_1` within City 0. |
| 21 | Truck Master | Unload `package_2` from `truck_0` at `location_0_1`. (P2 goal achieved) |
| 22 | Air Traffic Control | Unload `package_0` from `airplane_0` at `location_0_0` (City 0 Airport). (P0 goal achieved) |

**Result:** All packages are successfully delivered to their target locations.
