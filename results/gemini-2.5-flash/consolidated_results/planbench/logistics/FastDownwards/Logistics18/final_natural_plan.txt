This sequence of actions, orchestrated to move `package_0` from `location_0_1` (City 0) to `location_1_2` (City 1), is executed by the logistics agents following the provided plan.

### Logistics Plan Execution

**Phase 1: Local Transport to City 0 Airport (TruckAgent)**

1.  **TruckAgent:** Drive `truck_0` from its current location (`location_0_2`) to the package pickup point (`location_0_1`).
2.  **TruckAgent:** Load `package_0` onto `truck_0` at `location_0_1`.
3.  **TruckAgent:** Drive `truck_0` (carrying `package_0`) from `location_0_1` to the City 0 Airport (`location_0_0`).
4.  **TruckAgent:** Unload `package_0` from `truck_0` at the City 0 Airport (`location_0_0`).

**Phase 2: Positioning Airplane (AirAgent)**

5.  **AirAgent:** Fly `airplane_0` from the City 1 Airport (`location_1_0`) to the City 0 Airport (`location_0_0`) to retrieve the package.

**Phase 3: Inter-City Transport (AirAgent)**

6.  **AirAgent:** Load `package_0` onto `airplane_0` at the City 0 Airport (`location_0_0`).
7.  **AirAgent:** Fly `airplane_0` (carrying `package_0`) from the City 0 Airport (`location_0_0`) to the City 1 Airport (`location_1_0`).
8.  **AirAgent:** Unload `package_0` from `airplane_0` at the City 1 Airport (`location_1_0`).

**Phase 4: Local Delivery to Final Destination (TruckAgent)**

9.  **TruckAgent:** Load `package_0` onto `truck_1` at the City 1 Airport (`location_1_0`).
10. **TruckAgent:** Drive `truck_1` (carrying `package_0`) from the airport (`location_1_0`) to the final destination (`location_1_2`) within City 1.
11. **TruckAgent:** Unload `package_0` from `truck_1` at `location_1_2`.
