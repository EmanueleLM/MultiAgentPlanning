This plan outlines the steps necessary for the logistics agent to move `package_0` to the target `location_1_2` using local transportation within `city_1`.

The initial state summary: `package_0` is at `location_1_1`. `truck_1` is at `location_1_0`. Both locations are in `city_1`.

| Step | Timestamp (T) | Action | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 1 | T=1 | **DRIVE TRUCK** (truck\_1, location\_1\_0, location\_1\_1, city\_1) | Instruct `truck_1` to drive from its current position (`location_1_0`) to where the package is located (`location_1_1`) within `city_1`. |
| 2 | T=2 | **LOAD PACKAGE/TRUCK** (package\_0, truck\_1, location\_1\_1) | Load `package_0` onto `truck_1` at `location_1_1`. |
| 3 | T=3 | **DRIVE TRUCK** (truck\_1, location\_1\_1, location\_1\_2, city\_1) | Instruct `truck_1` (now carrying `package_0`) to drive from `location_1_1` to the final destination (`location_1_2`) within `city_1`. |
| 4 | T=4 | **UNLOAD PACKAGE/TRUCK** (package\_0, truck\_1, location\_1\_2) | Unload `package_0` from `truck_1` at `location_1_2`. |

**(Goal Achieved: package\_0 is now at location\_1\_2)**
