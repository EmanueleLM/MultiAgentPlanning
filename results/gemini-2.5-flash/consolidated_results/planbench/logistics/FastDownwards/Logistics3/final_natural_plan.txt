This logistics plan details the necessary steps to move Package 1 from City 1 to City 0 using air transport, while ensuring Package 0 remains in City 1.

The plan involves 4 sequential actions:

| Step | Action Type | Description of Action |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 1 | **Inter-City Movement (Fly)** | The Air Transport Agent commands **Airplane 1** to fly from **Location 0-0** (in City 0) to **Location 1-0** (in City 1). |
| 2 | **Inter-City Handling (Load)** | Load **Package 1** onto **Airplane 1** at **Location 1-0**. |
| 3 | **Inter-City Movement (Fly)** | The Air Transport Agent commands **Airplane 1** (now carrying Package 1) to fly from **Location 1-0** (in City 1) back to **Location 0-0** (in City 0). |
| 4 | **Inter-City Handling (Unload)** | Unload **Package 1** from **Airplane 1** at **Location 0-0**. |

**Result:** Package 1 is now at Location 0-0, and Package 0 remains at Location 1-0, achieving the global goal.
