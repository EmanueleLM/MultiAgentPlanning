The overall objective is to move `package_0` from its starting position at `location_1_1` to the final destination at `location_0_0`.

Here is the step-by-step execution plan:

| Step | Action Type | Details |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 1 | **Ground Loading** | Load `package_0` onto `truck_1` at `location_1_1` in City 1. |
| 2 | **Ground Movement** | Drive `truck_1` from `location_1_1` to the airport (`location_1_0`) within City 1. (`package_0` is now inside `truck_1` at `location_1_0`). |
| 3 | **Ground Unloading** | Unload `package_0` from `truck_1` at the airport (`location_1_0`) in City 1. |
| 4 | **Air Loading** | Load `package_0` onto `airplane_0` at the airport (`location_1_0`). |
| 5 | **Air Movement** | Fly `airplane_0` from `location_1_0` (City 1) to `location_0_0` (City 0). (`package_0` is now inside `airplane_0` at `location_0_0`). |
| 6 | **Air Unloading** | Unload `package_0` from `airplane_0` at `location_0_0`. |

**Result:** `package_0` is successfully delivered to `location_0_0`.
