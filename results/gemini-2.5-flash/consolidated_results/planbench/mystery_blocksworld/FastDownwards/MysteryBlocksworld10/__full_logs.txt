PROBLEM
------------------------------
I am playing with a set of objects. Here are the actions I can do

   Attack object
   Feast object from another object
   Succumb object
   Overcome object from another object

I have the following restrictions on my actions:
    To perform Attack action, the following facts need to be true: Province object, Planet object, Harmony.
    Once Attack action is performed the following facts will be true: Pain object.
    Once Attack action is performed the following facts will be false: Province object, Planet object, Harmony.
    To perform Succumb action, the following facts need to be true: Pain object.
    Once Succumb action is performed the following facts will be true: Province object, Planet object, Harmony.    
    Once Succumb action is performed the following facts will be false: Pain object.
    To perform Overcome action, the following needs to be true: Province other object, Pain object.
    Once Overcome action is performed the following will be true: Harmony, Province object, Object Craves other object.
    Once Overcome action is performed the following will be false: Province other object, Pain object.
    To perform Feast action, the following needs to be true: Object Craves other object, Province object, Harmony.
    Once Feast action is performed the following will be true: Pain object, Province other object.
    Once Feast action is performed the following will be false:, Object Craves other object, Province object, Harmony.

[STATEMENT]
As initial conditions I have that, object b craves object a, object c craves object b, harmony, planet object a, planet object d, province object c and province object d.
My goal is to have that object b craves object a and object d craves object c.

My plan is as follows:

NATURAL-PLAN sas_plan_1
------------------------------
This is the human-readable translation of the PDDL plan:

The environment starts in a state where objects 'b' craves 'a', 'c' craves 'b', and a state of general **Harmony** exists. Objects 'a' and 'd' are **Planets**, and 'c' and 'd' are designated as **Provinces**. The goal is to ensure 'b' craves 'a' and, crucially, that 'd' craves 'c'.

The following sequence of actions achieves the goal:

| Time | Action | Description of Action and Effects |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **T=1** | **Attack(d)** | **Action:** Initiate an Attack on object 'd'. *Preconditions met:* 'd' is a Province, 'd' is a Planet, and Harmony exists. **Effects:** 'd' now suffers **Pain**. 'd' loses its Province status and Planet status. **Harmony** is broken (negated). |
| **T=2** | **Overcome(d, c)** | **Action:** Object 'd' Overcomes object 'c'. *Preconditions met:* 'c' is a Province, and 'd' is suffering Pain. **Effects:** **Harmony** is restored. 'd' regains **Province** status. 'd' now **ObjectCraves(d, c)** (Goal condition met). 'c' loses its Province status. 'd' is no longer suffering Pain. |

**Final State:** The system has achieved the goal: Object 'b' Craves 'a' and Object 'd' Craves 'c'. (Total actions: 2)

PROBLEM
------------------------------
I am playing with a set of objects. Here are the actions I can do

   Attack object
   Feast object from another object
   Succumb object
   Overcome object from another object

I have the following restrictions on my actions:
    To perform Attack action, the following facts need to be true: Province object, Planet object, Harmony.
    Once Attack action is performed the following facts will be true: Pain object.
    Once Attack action is performed the following facts will be false: Province object, Planet object, Harmony.
    To perform Succumb action, the following facts need to be true: Pain object.
    Once Succumb action is performed the following facts will be true: Province object, Planet object, Harmony.    
    Once Succumb action is performed the following facts will be false: Pain object.
    To perform Overcome action, the following needs to be true: Province other object, Pain object.
    Once Overcome action is performed the following will be true: Harmony, Province object, Object Craves other object.
    Once Overcome action is performed the following will be false: Province other object, Pain object.
    To perform Feast action, the following needs to be true: Object Craves other object, Province object, Harmony.
    Once Feast action is performed the following will be true: Pain object, Province other object.
    Once Feast action is performed the following will be false:, Object Craves other object, Province object, Harmony.

[STATEMENT]
As initial conditions I have that, object a craves object c, object c craves object b, object d craves object a, harmony, planet object b and province object d.
My goal is to have that object a craves object b and object d craves object c.

This sequence of actions transitions the system from the initial configuration to the required goal state where Object A craves Object B, and Object D craves Object C.

| Step | Action | Description |
| :--- | :----- | :---------- |
| 1 | Feast (d, a) | Object D performs the **Feast** action, consuming its craving for Object A. |
| 2 | Succumb (d) | Object D performs the **Succumb** action, alleviating its pain and restoring Harmony. |
| 3 | Feast (a, c) | Object A performs the **Feast** action, consuming its craving for Object C. |
| 4 | Succumb (a) | Object A performs the **Succumb** action, alleviating its pain and restoring Harmony. |
| 5 | Feast (c, b) | Object C performs the **Feast** action, consuming its craving for Object B. |
| 6 | Succumb (c) | Object C performs the **Succumb** action, alleviating its pain and restoring Harmony. |
| 7 | Attack (a) | Object A performs the **Attack** action (preceded by A being in a province/planet state with Harmony). |
| 8 | Overcome (a, b) | Object A performs the **Overcome** action targeting Object B. This establishes the goal relationship: A now craves B, and Harmony is restored. |
| 9 | Attack (d) | Object D performs the **Attack** action (preceded by D being in a province/planet state with Harmony). |
| 10 | Overcome (d, c) | Object D performs the **Overcome** action targeting Object C. This establishes the second goal relationship: D now craves C, and Harmony is restored. |

NATURAL-PLAN sas_plan_1
------------------------------
This sequence of actions translates the PDDL plan into natural language instructions to achieve the goal: **Object 'a' craves Object 'c'.**

| Step | Time | Action | Description |

| 1 | t=1 | **Feast (a, d)** | Object 'a' feasts on Object 'd'. This breaks the 'a craves d' relationship, removes the state of Harmony, removes 'a' from its Province, and causes 'a' to enter a state of Pain. Object 'd' gains Province status. |
| 2 | t=2 | **Succumb (a)** | Object 'a' succumbs. This removes 'a's Pain, restores Harmony, and places 'a' back into both Province and Planet status. |
| 3 | t=3 | **Feast (d, b)** | Object 'd' feasts on Object 'b'. This breaks the 'd craves b' relationship (requires d to be in Province, and Harmony), causes 'd' to enter a state of Pain, and places 'b' into Province status. Harmony and 'd's Province status are lost. |
| 4 | t=4 | **Succumb (d)** | Object 'd' succumbs. This removes 'd's Pain, restores Harmony, and places 'd' back into both Province and Planet status. |
| 5 | t=5 | **Feast (b, c)** | Object 'b' feasts on Object 'c'. This breaks the 'b craves c' relationship (requires b to be in Province, and Harmony), causes 'b' to enter a state of Pain, and places 'c' into Province status. Harmony and 'b's Province status are lost. |
| 6 | t=6 | **Succumb (b)** | Object 'b' succumbs. This removes 'b's Pain, restores Harmony, and places 'b' back into both Province and Planet status. |
| 7 | t=7 | **Attack (a)** | Object 'a' attacks. (Requires 'a' to be in Province, 'a' to be a Planet, and Harmony). This removes Harmony, removes 'a' from Province/Planet status, and causes 'a' to enter a state of Pain. |
| 8 | t=8 | **Overcome (a, c)** | Object 'a' overcomes Object 'c'. (Requires 'a' to be in Pain and 'c' to be in Province). This removes 'a's Pain and 'c's Province status, restores Harmony, places 'a' into Province status, and establishes the new relationship: **'a craves c' (Goal Achieved).** |</blockquote>

PROBLEM
------------------------------
I am playing with a set of objects. Here are the actions I can do

   Attack object
   Feast object from another object
   Succumb object
   Overcome object from another object

I have the following restrictions on my actions:
    To perform Attack action, the following facts need to be true: Province object, Planet object, Harmony.
    Once Attack action is performed the following facts will be true: Pain object.
    Once Attack action is performed the following facts will be false: Province object, Planet object, Harmony.
    To perform Succumb action, the following facts need to be true: Pain object.
    Once Succumb action is performed the following facts will be true: Province object, Planet object, Harmony.    
    Once Succumb action is performed the following facts will be false: Pain object.
    To perform Overcome action, the following needs to be true: Province other object, Pain object.
    Once Overcome action is performed the following will be true: Harmony, Province object, Object Craves other object.
    Once Overcome action is performed the following will be false: Province other object, Pain object.
    To perform Feast action, the following needs to be true: Object Craves other object, Province object, Harmony.
    Once Feast action is performed the following will be true: Pain object, Province other object.
    Once Feast action is performed the following will be false:, Object Craves other object, Province object, Harmony.

PROBLEM
------------------------------
I am playing with a set of objects. Here are the actions I can do

   Attack object
   Feast object from another object
   Succumb object
   Overcome object from another object

I have the following restrictions on my actions:
    To perform Attack action, the following facts need to be true: Province object, Planet object, Harmony.
    Once Attack action is performed the following facts will be true: Pain object.
    Once Attack action is performed the following facts will be false: Province object, Planet object, Harmony.
    To perform Succumb action, the following facts need to be true: Pain object.
    Once Succumb action is performed the following facts will be true: Province object, Planet object, Harmony.    
    Once Succumb action is performed the following facts will be false: Pain object.
    To perform Overcome action, the following needs to be true: Province other object, Pain object.
    Once Overcome action is performed the following will be true: Harmony, Province object, Object Craves other object.
    Once Overcome action is performed the following will be false: Province other object, Pain object.
    To perform Feast action, the following needs to be true: Object Craves other object, Province object, Harmony.
    Once Feast action is performed the following will be true: Pain object, Province other object.
    Once Feast action is performed the following will be false:, Object Craves other object, Province object, Harmony.

[STATEMENT]
As initial conditions I have that, object c craves object d, object d craves object a, harmony, planet object a, planet object b, province object b and province object c.
My goal is to have that object a craves object c, object b craves object a and object d craves object b.

I am playing with a set of objects. Here are the actions I can do

   Attack object
   Feast object from another object
   Succumb object
   Overcome object from another object

I have the following restrictions on my actions:
    To perform Attack action, the following facts need to be true: Province object, Planet object, Harmony.
    Once Attack action is performed the following facts will be true: Pain object.
    Once Attack action is performed the following facts will be false: Province object, Planet object, Harmony.
    To perform Succumb action, the following facts need to be true: Pain object.
    Once Succumb action is performed the following facts will be true: Province object, Planet object, Harmony.    
    Once Succumb action is performed the following facts will be false: Pain object.
    To perform Overcome action, the following needs to be true: Province other object, Pain object.
    Once Overcome action is performed the following will be true: Harmony, Province object, Object Craves other object.
    Once Overcome action is performed the following will be false: Province other object, Pain object.
    To perform Feast action, the following needs to be true: Object Craves other object, Province object, Harmony.
    Once Feast action is performed the following will be true: Pain object, Province other object.
    Once Feast action is performed the following will be false:, Object Craves other object, Province object, Harmony.

[STATEMENT]
As initial conditions I have that, object c craves object b, object d craves object a, harmony, planet object a, planet object b, province object c and province object d.

NATURAL-PLAN sas_plan_1
------------------------------
Based on the PDDL domain, problem, and the resulting plan, here is the sequence of human-readable instructions required to achieve the goal state.

The goal is to establish a state where Object A craves Object D, and Object B craves Object C.

| Step | PDDL Action | Description of Action |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 1 | (feast c b) | Object C performs a Feast upon Object B. |
| 2 | (succumb c) | Object C Succumbs, restoring planetary Harmony. |
| 3 | (feast d a) | Object D performs a Feast upon Object A. |
| 4 | (succumb d) | Object D Succumbs, restoring planetary Harmony. |
| 5 | (attack a) | Object A performs an Attack. |
| 6 | (overcome a d) | Object A Overcomes Object D. (Goal 1 Achieved: A Craves D). |
| 7 | (attack b) | Object B performs an Attack. |
| 8 | (overcome b c) | Object B Overcomes Object C. (Goal 2 Achieved: B Craves C). |

PROBLEM
------------------------------
I am playing with a set of objects. Here are the actions I can do

   Attack object
   Feast object from another object
   Succumb object
   Overcome object from another object

I have the following restrictions on my actions:
    To perform Attack action, the following facts need to be true: Province object, Planet object, Harmony.
    Once Attack action is performed the following facts will be true: Pain object.
    Once Attack action is performed the following facts will be false: Province object, Planet object, Harmony.
    To perform Succumb action, the following facts need to be true: Pain object.
    Once Succumb action is performed the following facts will be true: Province object, Planet object, Harmony.    
    Once Succumb action is performed the following facts will be false: Pain object.
    To perform Overcome action, the following needs to be true: Province other object, Pain object.
    Once Overcome action is performed the following will be true: Harmony, Province object, Object Craves other object.
    Once Overcome action is performed the following will be false: Province other object, Pain object.
    To perform Feast action, the following needs to be true: Object Craves other object, Province object, Harmony.
    Once Feast action is performed the following will be true: Pain object, Province other object.
    Once Feast action is performed the following will be false:, Object Craves other object, Province object, Harmony.

[STATEMENT]
As initial conditions I have that, object a craves object d, object b craves object c, harmony, planet object c, planet object d, province object a and province object b.
My goal is to have that object b craves object d and object d craves object a.

NATURAL-PLAN sas_plan_1
------------------------------
Based on the provided specification, initial state, goal, and PDDL plan, the sequence of human-readable instructions required to achieve the goal state is as follows:

| Step | Action | Description |
| :--- | :----- | :---------- |
| 1 | **Feast (b d)** | Object 'b' initiates the Feast on object 'd'. (Preconditions: b craves d, b is a Province, Harmony exists). This results in 'b' entering a state of Pain, 'd' becoming a Province, and the loss of the relationship and Harmony. |
| 2 | **Overcome (b c)** | Object 'b' initiates the Overcome action against object 'c'. (Preconditions: b is in Pain, c is a Province). This action restores Harmony, makes 'b' a Province, and establishes the craving (ObjectCraves b c). Object 'c' ceases to be a Province, and 'b' loses its Pain. |
| 3 | **Attack (d)** | Object 'd' initiates an Attack. (Preconditions: d is a Province, d is a Planet, Harmony exists). This causes 'd' to enter a state of Pain, and removes 'd's status as a Province and Planet, while also dissolving Harmony. |
| 4 | **Overcome (d a)** | Object 'd' initiates the Overcome action against object 'a'. (Preconditions: d is in Pain, a is a Province). This restores Harmony, makes 'd' a Province, and establishes the craving (ObjectCraves d a). Object 'a' ceases to be a Province, and 'd' loses its Pain. |

This sequence of 4 actions achieves the final goal: (ObjectCraves b c) and (ObjectCraves d a).
