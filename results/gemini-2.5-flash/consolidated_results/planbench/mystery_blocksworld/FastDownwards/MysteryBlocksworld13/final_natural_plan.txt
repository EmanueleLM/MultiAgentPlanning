This plan outlines the sequence of 6 actions required to transition from the initial configuration to the goal state where object 'a' craves 'c' and object 'b' craves 'a'.

The required actions are:

1.  **Feast (Object c, Object b):** Object 'c' initiates the Feast on object 'b'. (Requires: c craves b, c is a Province, Harmony is present. Results in: c experiencing Pain, b becoming a Province, and Harmony is lost.)
2.  **Succumb (Object c):** Object 'c' must Succumb. (Requires: c experiencing Pain. Results in: c regaining Province status and Planet status, and Harmony is restored.)
3.  **Attack (Object a):** Object 'a' performs an Attack. (Requires: a is a Province, a is a Planet, Harmony is present. Results in: a experiencing Pain, and Harmony is lost.)
4.  **Overcome (Object a, Object c):** Object 'a' must Overcome object 'c'. (Requires: a experiencing Pain, c is a Province. Results in: Harmony is restored, a becomes a Province, and **a craves c**.)
5.  **Feast (Object b, Object d):** Object 'b' initiates the Feast on object 'd'. (Requires: b craves d, b is a Province, Harmony is present. Results in: b experiencing Pain, d becoming a Province, and Harmony is lost.)
6.  **Overcome (Object b, Object a):** Object 'b' must Overcome object 'a'. (Requires: b experiencing Pain, a is a Province. Results in: Harmony is restored, b becomes a Province, and **b craves a**.)
