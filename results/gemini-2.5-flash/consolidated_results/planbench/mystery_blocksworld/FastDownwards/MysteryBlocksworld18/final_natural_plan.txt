This plan details the sequence of actions necessary to transform the environment from its initial state to the desired goal state (where (Craves b a), (Craves c d), and (Craves d b) are all true).

The required sequence of human-readable actions is:

| Step | Time | Action | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 1 | T+0 | **Feast (b, d)** | Entity 'b' executes a Feast targeting 'd'. (Precondition: b Craves d, b is a Province, Harmony exists. Effects: b is now in Pain, d becomes a Province, Harmony is removed.) |
| 2 | T+1 | **Succumb (b)** | Entity 'b' Succumbs to its Pain. (Precondition: b is in Pain. Effects: b becomes a Province, b becomes a Planet, Harmony is restored.) |
| 3 | T+2 | **Feast (c, a)** | Entity 'c' executes a Feast targeting 'a'. (Precondition: c Craves a, c is a Province, Harmony exists. Effects: c is now in Pain, a becomes a Province, Harmony is removed.) |
| 4 | T+3 | **Overcome (c, d)** | Entity 'c' Overcomes its Pain using 'd'. (Precondition: d is a Province, c is in Pain. Effects: Harmony is restored, c becomes a Province, c Craves d, d ceases to be a Province.) |
| 5 | T+4 | **Attack (b)** | Entity 'b' initiates an Attack. (Precondition: b is a Province, b is a Planet, Harmony exists. Effects: b is now in Pain, Province/Planet status removed for b, Harmony is removed.) |
| 6 | T+5 | **Overcome (b, a)** | Entity 'b' Overcomes its Pain using 'a'. (Precondition: a is a Province, b is in Pain. Effects: Harmony is restored, b becomes a Province, b Craves a, a ceases to be a Province.) |
| 7 | T+6 | **Feast (c, d)** | Entity 'c' executes a Feast targeting 'd'. (Precondition: c Craves d, c is a Province, Harmony exists. Effects: c is now in Pain, d becomes a Province, Harmony is removed.) |
| 8 | T+7 | **Succumb (c)** | Entity 'c' Succumbs to its Pain. (Precondition: c is in Pain. Effects: c becomes a Province, c becomes a Planet, Harmony is restored.) |
| 9 | T+8 | **Attack (d)** | Entity 'd' initiates an Attack. (Precondition: d is a Province, d is a Planet, Harmony exists. Effects: d is now in Pain, Province/Planet status removed for d, Harmony is removed.) |
| 10 | T+9 | **Overcome (d, b)** | Entity 'd' Overcomes its Pain using 'b'. (Precondition: b is a Province, d is in Pain. Effects: Harmony is restored, d becomes a Province, d Craves b, b ceases to be a Province.) |
| 11 | T+10 | **Attack (c)** | Entity 'c' initiates an Attack. (Precondition: c is a Province, c is a Planet, Harmony exists. Effects: c is now in Pain, Province/Planet status removed for c, Harmony is removed.) |
| 12 | T+11 | **Overcome (c, d)** | Entity 'c' Overcomes its Pain using 'd'. (Precondition: d is a Province, c is in Pain. Effects: Harmony is restored, c becomes a Province, c Craves d, d ceases to be a Province.) |

The goal state (Craves b a, Craves c d, Craves d b) is achieved after step 12.
