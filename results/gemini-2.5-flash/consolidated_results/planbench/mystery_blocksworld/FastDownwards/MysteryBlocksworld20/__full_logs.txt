PROBLEM
------------------------------
I am playing with a set of objects. Here are the actions I can do

   Attack object
   Feast object from another object
   Succumb object
   Overcome object from another object

I have the following restrictions on my actions:
    To perform Attack action, the following facts need to be true: Province object, Planet object, Harmony.
    Once Attack action is performed the following facts will be true: Pain object.
    Once Attack action is performed the following facts will be false: Province object, Planet object, Harmony.
    To perform Succumb action, the following facts need to be true: Pain object.
    Once Succumb action is performed the following facts will be true: Province object, Planet object, Harmony.    
    Once Succumb action is performed the following facts will be false: Pain object.
    To perform Overcome action, the following needs to be true: Province other object, Pain object.
    Once Overcome action is performed the following will be true: Harmony, Province object, Object Craves other object.
    Once Overcome action is performed the following will be false: Province other object, Pain object.
    To perform Feast action, the following needs to be true: Object Craves other object, Province object, Harmony.
    Once Feast action is performed the following will be true: Pain object, Province other object.
    Once Feast action is performed the following will be false:, Object Craves other object, Province object, Harmony.

[STATEMENT]
As initial conditions I have that, object a craves object d, object b craves object c, harmony, planet object c, planet object d, province object a and province object b.
My goal is to have that object b craves object d and object d craves object a.

This removes (Pain d) and restores (Province d), (Planet d), and (Harmony).\n3.  **Generate Pain B:** Execute `Attack(b)`. Pre: (Province b), (Planet b), (Harmony). This yields (Pain b) and removes (Province b), (Planet b), and (Harmony).\n4.  **Overcome B on C (Goal 1 Achieved):** Execute `Overcome(b c)`. Pre: (Province c), (Pain b). This yields (ObjectCraves b c), restores (Harmony), and adds (Province b). It removes (Province c) and (Pain b).\n    *   *Note: Goal 1 (b c) is achieved, but the state must be modified for Goal 2.*\n\n**Phase 2: Enabling (ObjectCraves d a)**\n\n5.  **Generate Pain D:** Execute `Attack(d)`. Pre: (Province d), (Planet d), (Harmony). This yields (Pain d) but removes (Harmony).\n6.  **Restore Harmony 2:** Execute `Succumb(d)`. This removes (Pain d) and restores (Harmony) and (Province d).\n7.  **Sacrifice Goal 1 to gain Province C:** Execute `Feast(b c)`. Pre: (ObjectCraves b c), (Province b), (Harmony). This removes (ObjectCraves b c) (Goal 1 lost) and (Harmony), and yields (Pain b) and the needed (Province c).\n8.  **Restore Harmony 3:** Execute `Succumb(b)`. This removes (Pain b) and restores (Harmony) and (Province b).\n9.  **Feast C on A to gain Province A:** Execute `Feast(c a)`. Pre: (ObjectCraves c a), (Province c), (Harmony). This removes (ObjectCraves c a) and (Harmony), and yields (Pain c) and the crucial (Province a).\n10. **Restore Harmony 4:** Execute `Succumb(c)`. This removes (Pain c) and restores (Harmony) and (Province c).\n\n**Phase 3: Final Goal Achievement**\n\n11. **Generate Pain D:** Execute `Attack(d)`. Pre: (Province d), (Planet d), (Harmony). This yields (Pain d) but removes (Harmony).\n12. **Overcome D on A (Goal 2 Achieved):** Execute `Overcome(d a)`. Pre: (Province a), (Pain d). This yields (ObjectCraves d a), restores (Harmony), and adds (Province d). It removes (Province a) and (Pain d).\n\n**Phase 4: Re-Achieving (ObjectCraves b c)**\n\n13. **Generate Pain B:** Execute `Attack(b)`. Pre: (Province b), (Planet b), (Harmony). This yields (Pain b) but removes (Harmony).\n14. **Overcome B on C (Goal 1 Re-Achieved):** Execute `Overcome(b c)`. Pre: (Province c), (Pain b). This yields (ObjectCraves b c), restores (Harmony), and adds (Province b).

Since achieving one goal often undoes the preconditions or effects needed for the other, Harmony must be frequently restored using the `Succumb` action.\n\n**Initial State Key Facts:** (ObjectCraves c a), (ObjectCraves d c), (Harmony), (Planet a), (Planet b), (Province b), (Province d).\n\n**Goal State:** (ObjectCraves b c) and (ObjectCraves d a).\n\n### Natural Language Plan Outline:\n\n**Phase 1: Temporary Achievement of (ObjectCraves b c)**\n\n1.  **Feast D on C:** Execute `Feast(d c)`. This consumes (ObjectCraves d c), removes (Province d) and (Harmony), and yields (Pain d) and the crucial (Province c).\n2.  **Restore Harmony 1:** Execute `Succumb(d)`. This removes (Pain d) and restores (Province d), (Planet d), and (Harmony).\n3.  **Generate Pain B:** Execute `Attack(b)`. Pre: (Province b), (Planet b), (Harmony). This yields (Pain b) and removes (Province b), (Planet b), and (Harmony).\n4.  **Overcome B on C (Goal 1 Achieved):** Execute `Overcome(b c)`. Pre: (Province c), (Pain b).

This removes (Pain d) and restores (Harmony) and (Province d).\n7.  **Sacrifice Goal 1 to gain Province C:** Execute `Feast(b c)`. Pre: (ObjectCraves b c), (Province b), (Harmony). This removes (ObjectCraves b c) (Goal 1 lost) and (Harmony), and yields (Pain b) and the needed (Province c).\n8.  **Restore Harmony 3:** Execute `Succumb(b)`. This removes (Pain b) and restores (Harmony) and (Province b).\n9.  **Feast C on A to gain Province A:** Execute `Feast(c a)`. Pre: (ObjectCraves c a), (Province c), (Harmony). This removes (ObjectCraves c a) and (Harmony), and yields (Pain c) and the crucial (Province a).\n10. **Restore Harmony 4:** Execute `Succumb(c)`. This removes (Pain c) and restores (Harmony) and (Province c).\n\n**Phase 3: Final Goal Achievement**\n\n11. **Generate Pain D:** Execute `Attack(d)`. Pre: (Province d), (Planet d), (Harmony). This yields (Pain d) but removes (Harmony).\n12. **Overcome D on A (Goal 2 Achieved):** Execute `Overcome(d a)`. Pre: (Province a), (Pain d). This yields (ObjectCraves d a), restores (Harmony), and adds (Province d). It removes (Province a) and (Pain d).\n\n**Phase 4: Re-Achieving (ObjectCraves b c)**\n\n13. **Generate Pain B:** Execute `Attack(b)`. Pre: (Province b), (Planet b), (Harmony). This yields (Pain b) but removes (Harmony).\n14. **Overcome B on C (Goal 1 Re-Achieved):** Execute `Overcome(b c)`. Pre: (Province c), (Pain b).

NATURAL-PLAN sas_plan_2
------------------------------
This plan outlines the sequence of eight abstract actions required to transition the environment from the initial configuration to the desired goal state (where Object **b** Craves **c** and Object **d** Craves **a**).

| Step | Action | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 1 | `(feast d c)` | Object **d** executes the Feast action upon object **c**. (Preconditions: d Craves c, d is a Province, Harmony exists. Effects: d is put into Pain, c becomes a Province, Harmony is removed). |
| 2 | `(succumb d)` | Object **d** must Succumb (ending its state of Pain). (Preconditions: d is in Pain. Effects: d becomes a Province and a Planet, Harmony is restored). |
| 3 | `(feast c a)` | Object **c** executes the Feast action upon object **a**. (Preconditions: c Craves a, c is a Province, Harmony exists. Effects: c is put into Pain, a becomes a Province, Harmony is removed). |
| 4 | `(succumb c)` | Object **c** must Succumb (ending its state of Pain). (Preconditions: c is in Pain. Effects: c becomes a Province and a Planet, Harmony is restored). |
| 5 | `(attack b)` | Object **b** initiates an Attack. (Preconditions: b is a Province, b is a Planet, Harmony exists. Effects: b is put into Pain, b loses Province and Planet status, Harmony is removed). |
| 6 | `(overcome b c)` | Object **b** must Overcome object **c** to establish a new craving relationship. (Preconditions: b is in Pain, c is a Province. Effects: **Goal 1 (ObjectCraves b c) achieved**, b loses Pain, c loses Province status, b becomes a Province, Harmony is restored). |
| 7 | `(attack d)` | Object **d** initiates an Attack. (Preconditions: d is a Province, d is a Planet, Harmony exists. Effects: d is put into Pain, d loses Province and Planet status, Harmony is removed). |
| 8 | `(overcome d a)` | Object **d** must Overcome object **a** to establish the final craving relationship. (Preconditions: d is in Pain, a is a Province. Effects: **Goal 2 (ObjectCraves d a) achieved**, d loses Pain, a loses Province status, d becomes a Province, Harmony is restored). |
