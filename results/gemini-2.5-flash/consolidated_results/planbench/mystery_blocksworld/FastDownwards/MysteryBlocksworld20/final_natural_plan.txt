This plan outlines the sequence of eight abstract actions required to transition the environment from the initial configuration to the desired goal state (where Object **b** Craves **c** and Object **d** Craves **a**).

| Step | Action | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 1 | `(feast d c)` | Object **d** executes the Feast action upon object **c**. (Preconditions: d Craves c, d is a Province, Harmony exists. Effects: d is put into Pain, c becomes a Province, Harmony is removed). |
| 2 | `(succumb d)` | Object **d** must Succumb (ending its state of Pain). (Preconditions: d is in Pain. Effects: d becomes a Province and a Planet, Harmony is restored). |
| 3 | `(feast c a)` | Object **c** executes the Feast action upon object **a**. (Preconditions: c Craves a, c is a Province, Harmony exists. Effects: c is put into Pain, a becomes a Province, Harmony is removed). |
| 4 | `(succumb c)` | Object **c** must Succumb (ending its state of Pain). (Preconditions: c is in Pain. Effects: c becomes a Province and a Planet, Harmony is restored). |
| 5 | `(attack b)` | Object **b** initiates an Attack. (Preconditions: b is a Province, b is a Planet, Harmony exists. Effects: b is put into Pain, b loses Province and Planet status, Harmony is removed). |
| 6 | `(overcome b c)` | Object **b** must Overcome object **c** to establish a new craving relationship. (Preconditions: b is in Pain, c is a Province. Effects: **Goal 1 (ObjectCraves b c) achieved**, b loses Pain, c loses Province status, b becomes a Province, Harmony is restored). |
| 7 | `(attack d)` | Object **d** initiates an Attack. (Preconditions: d is a Province, d is a Planet, Harmony exists. Effects: d is put into Pain, d loses Province and Planet status, Harmony is removed). |
| 8 | `(overcome d a)` | Object **d** must Overcome object **a** to establish the final craving relationship. (Preconditions: d is in Pain, a is a Province. Effects: **Goal 2 (ObjectCraves d a) achieved**, d loses Pain, a loses Province status, d becomes a Province, Harmony is restored). |
