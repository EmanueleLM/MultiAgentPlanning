This removes (Pain d) and restores (Province d), (Planet d), and (Harmony).\n3.  **Generate Pain B:** Execute `Attack(b)`. Pre: (Province b), (Planet b), (Harmony). This yields (Pain b) and removes (Province b), (Planet b), and (Harmony).\n4.  **Overcome B on C (Goal 1 Achieved):** Execute `Overcome(b c)`. Pre: (Province c), (Pain b). This yields (ObjectCraves b c), restores (Harmony), and adds (Province b).

Pre: (Province d), (Planet d), (Harmony). This yields (Pain d) but removes (Harmony).\n6.  **Restore Harmony 2:** Execute `Succumb(d)`. This removes (Pain d) and restores (Harmony) and (Province d).\n7.  **Sacrifice Goal 1 to gain Province C:** Execute `Feast(b c)`. Pre: (ObjectCraves b c), (Province b), (Harmony). This removes (ObjectCraves b c) (Goal 1 lost) and (Harmony), and yields (Pain b) and the needed (Province c).\n8.  **Restore Harmony 3:** Execute `Succumb(b)`. This removes (Pain b) and restores (Harmony) and (Province b).\n9.  **Feast C on A to gain Province A:** Execute `Feast(c a)`. Pre: (ObjectCraves c a), (Province c), (Harmony). This removes (ObjectCraves c a) and (Harmony), and yields (Pain c) and the crucial (Province a).\n10. **Restore Harmony 4:** Execute `Succumb(c)`. This removes (Pain c) and restores (Harmony) and (Province c).\n\n**Phase 3: Final Goal Achievement**\n\n11. **Generate Pain D:** Execute `Attack(d)`. Pre: (Province d), (Planet d), (Harmony). This yields (Pain d) but removes (Harmony).\n12. **Overcome D on A (Goal 2 Achieved):** Execute `Overcome(d a)`. Pre: (Province a), (Pain d). This yields (ObjectCraves d a), restores (Harmony), and adds (Province d). It removes (Province a) and (Pain d).\n\n**Phase 4: Re-Achieving (ObjectCraves b c)**\n\n13. **Generate Pain B:** Execute `Attack(b)`. Pre: (Province b), (Planet b), (Harmony). This yields (Pain b) but removes (Harmony).\n14. **Overcome B on C (Goal 1 Re-Achieved):** Execute `Overcome(b c)`. Pre: (Province c), (Pain b). This yields (ObjectCraves b c), restores (Harmony), and adds (Province b).

This removes (Pain d) and restores (Province d), (Planet d), and (Harmony).\n3.  **Generate Pain B:** Execute `Attack(b)`. Pre: (Province b), (Planet b), (Harmony).

This removes (Pain c) and restores (Harmony) and (Province c).\n\n**Phase 3: Final Goal Achievement**\n\n11. **Generate Pain D:** Execute `Attack(d)`. Pre: (Province d), (Planet d), (Harmony). This yields (Pain d) but removes (Harmony).\n12. **Overcome D on A (Goal 2 Achieved):** Execute `Overcome(d a)`. Pre: (Province a), (Pain d).

It removes (Province a) and (Pain d).\n\n**Phase 4: Re-Achieving (ObjectCraves b c)**\n\n13. **Generate Pain B:** Execute `Attack(b)`. Pre: (Province b), (Planet b), (Harmony).

NATURAL-PLAN sas_plan_2
------------------------------
This plan outlines the sequence of eight abstract actions required to transition the environment from the initial configuration to the desired goal state (where Object **b** Craves **c** and Object **d** Craves **a**).

| Step | Action | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 1 | `(feast d c)` | Object **d** executes the Feast action upon object **c**. (Preconditions: d Craves c, d is a Province, Harmony exists. Effects: d is put into Pain, c becomes a Province, Harmony is removed). |
| 2 | `(succumb d)` | Object **d** must Succumb (ending its state of Pain). (Preconditions: d is in Pain. Effects: d becomes a Province and a Planet, Harmony is restored). |
| 3 | `(feast c a)` | Object **c** executes the Feast action upon object **a**. (Preconditions: c Craves a, c is a Province, Harmony exists. Effects: c is put into Pain, a becomes a Province, Harmony is removed). |
| 4 | `(succumb c)` | Object **c** must Succumb (ending its state of Pain). (Preconditions: c is in Pain. Effects: c becomes a Province and a Planet, Harmony is restored). |
| 5 | `(attack b)` | Object **b** initiates an Attack. (Preconditions: b is a Province, b is a Planet, Harmony exists. Effects: b is put into Pain, b loses Province and Planet status, Harmony is removed). |
| 6 | `(overcome b c)` | Object **b** must Overcome object **c** to establish a new craving relationship. (Preconditions: b is in Pain, c is a Province. Effects: **Goal 1 (ObjectCraves b c) achieved**, b loses Pain, c loses Province status, b becomes a Province, Harmony is restored). |
| 7 | `(attack d)` | Object **d** initiates an Attack. (Preconditions: d is a Province, d is a Planet, Harmony exists. Effects: d is put into Pain, d loses Province and Planet status, Harmony is removed). |
| 8 | `(overcome d a)` | Object **d** must Overcome object **a** to establish the final craving relationship. (Preconditions: d is in Pain, a is a Province. Effects: **Goal 2 (ObjectCraves d a) achieved**, d loses Pain, a loses Province status, d becomes a Province, Harmony is restored). |

NATURAL-PLAN sas_plan_1
------------------------------
This plan executes the necessary sequence of state transitions to achieve the goal: object B craving C, and object D craving A.

| Step | Action | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 1 | **(Feast A D)** | Object A, acting as a Province under Harmony and craving D, executes the Feast action on D. This results in A gaining Pain and D gaining Province status, while destroying Harmony and A's prior craving for D. |
| 2 | **(Succumb A)** | Object A, currently in Pain, executes the Succumb action. This restores Harmony, and A recovers its Province and Planet status. |
| 3 | **(Feast D C)** | Object D, now a Province under Harmony and craving C, executes the Feast action on C. This results in D gaining Pain and C gaining Province status, while destroying Harmony and D's prior craving for C. |
| 4 | **(Overcome D A)** | Object D, currently in Pain, executes Overcome against Province A. This establishes the desired Craving (D $\rightarrow$ A), restores Harmony, and D gains Province status, while A loses its Province status. |
| 5 | **(Attack B)** | Object B, currently a Province and Planet under Harmony, executes the Attack action. This causes B to gain Pain and immediately destroys Harmony, and B loses its Province and Planet status. |
| 6 | **(Overcome B C)** | Object B, currently in Pain, executes Overcome against Province C. This establishes the final desired Craving (B $\rightarrow$ C), restores Harmony, and B gains Province status, while C loses its Province status. |
