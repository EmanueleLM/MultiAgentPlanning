This plan executes the necessary sequence of state transitions to achieve the goal: object B craving C, and object D craving A.

| Step | Action | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 1 | **(Feast A D)** | Object A, acting as a Province under Harmony and craving D, executes the Feast action on D. This results in A gaining Pain and D gaining Province status, while destroying Harmony and A's prior craving for D. |
| 2 | **(Succumb A)** | Object A, currently in Pain, executes the Succumb action. This restores Harmony, and A recovers its Province and Planet status. |
| 3 | **(Feast D C)** | Object D, now a Province under Harmony and craving C, executes the Feast action on C. This results in D gaining Pain and C gaining Province status, while destroying Harmony and D's prior craving for C. |
| 4 | **(Overcome D A)** | Object D, currently in Pain, executes Overcome against Province A. This establishes the desired Craving (D $\rightarrow$ A), restores Harmony, and D gains Province status, while A loses its Province status. |
| 5 | **(Attack B)** | Object B, currently a Province and Planet under Harmony, executes the Attack action. This causes B to gain Pain and immediately destroys Harmony, and B loses its Province and Planet status. |
| 6 | **(Overcome B C)** | Object B, currently in Pain, executes Overcome against Province C. This establishes the final desired Craving (B $\rightarrow$ C), restores Harmony, and B gains Province status, while C loses its Province status. |
