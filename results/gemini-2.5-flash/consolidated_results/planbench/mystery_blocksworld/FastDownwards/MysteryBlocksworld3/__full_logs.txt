PROBLEM
------------------------------
I am playing with a set of objects. Here are the actions I can do

   Attack object
   Feast object from another object
   Succumb object
   Overcome object from another object

I have the following restrictions on my actions:
    To perform Attack action, the following facts need to be true: Province object, Planet object, Harmony.
    Once Attack action is performed the following facts will be true: Pain object.
    Once Attack action is performed the following facts will be false: Province object, Planet object, Harmony.
    To perform Succumb action, the following facts need to be true: Pain object.
    Once Succumb action is performed the following facts will be true: Province object, Planet object, Harmony.    
    Once Succumb action is performed the following facts will be false: Pain object.
    To perform Overcome action, the following needs to be true: Province other object, Pain object.
    Once Overcome action is performed the following will be true: Harmony, Province object, Object Craves other object.
    Once Overcome action is performed the following will be false: Province other object, Pain object.
    To perform Feast action, the following needs to be true: Object Craves other object, Province object, Harmony.
    Once Feast action is performed the following will be true: Pain object, Province other object.
    Once Feast action is performed the following will be false:, Object Craves other object, Province object, Harmony.

[STATEMENT]
As initial conditions I have that, object b craves object a, object c craves object b, harmony, planet object a, planet object d, province object c and province object d.
My goal is to have that object b craves object a and object d craves object c.

My plan is as follows:

NATURAL-PLAN sas_plan_1
------------------------------
This is the human-readable translation of the PDDL plan:

The environment starts in a state where objects 'b' craves 'a', 'c' craves 'b', and a state of general **Harmony** exists. Objects 'a' and 'd' are **Planets**, and 'c' and 'd' are designated as **Provinces**. The goal is to ensure 'b' craves 'a' and, crucially, that 'd' craves 'c'.

The following sequence of actions achieves the goal:

| Time | Action | Description of Action and Effects |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **T=1** | **Attack(d)** | **Action:** Initiate an Attack on object 'd'. *Preconditions met:* 'd' is a Province, 'd' is a Planet, and Harmony exists. **Effects:** 'd' now suffers **Pain**. 'd' loses its Province status and Planet status. **Harmony** is broken (negated). |
| **T=2** | **Overcome(d, c)** | **Action:** Object 'd' Overcomes object 'c'. *Preconditions met:* 'c' is a Province, and 'd' is suffering Pain. **Effects:** **Harmony** is restored. 'd' regains **Province** status. 'd' now **ObjectCraves(d, c)** (Goal condition met). 'c' loses its Province status. 'd' is no longer suffering Pain. |

**Final State:** The system has achieved the goal: Object 'b' Craves 'a' and Object 'd' Craves 'c'. (Total actions: 2)
