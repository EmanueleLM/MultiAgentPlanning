This sequence of actions transitions the system from the initial configuration to the required goal state where Object A craves Object B, and Object D craves Object C.

| Step | Action | Description |
| :--- | :----- | :---------- |
| 1 | Feast (d, a) | Object D performs the **Feast** action, consuming its craving for Object A. |
| 2 | Succumb (d) | Object D performs the **Succumb** action, alleviating its pain and restoring Harmony. |
| 3 | Feast (a, c) | Object A performs the **Feast** action, consuming its craving for Object C. |
| 4 | Succumb (a) | Object A performs the **Succumb** action, alleviating its pain and restoring Harmony. |
| 5 | Feast (c, b) | Object C performs the **Feast** action, consuming its craving for Object B. |
| 6 | Succumb (c) | Object C performs the **Succumb** action, alleviating its pain and restoring Harmony. |
| 7 | Attack (a) | Object A performs the **Attack** action (preceded by A being in a province/planet state with Harmony). |
| 8 | Overcome (a, b) | Object A performs the **Overcome** action targeting Object B. This establishes the goal relationship: A now craves B, and Harmony is restored. |
| 9 | Attack (d) | Object D performs the **Attack** action (preceded by D being in a province/planet state with Harmony). |
| 10 | Overcome (d, c) | Object D performs the **Overcome** action targeting Object C. This establishes the second goal relationship: D now craves C, and Harmony is restored. |
