This sequence of actions translates the PDDL plan into natural language instructions to achieve the goal: **Object 'a' craves Object 'c'.**

| Step | Time | Action | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 1 | t=1 | **Feast (a, d)** | Object 'a' feasts on Object 'd'. This breaks the 'a craves d' relationship, removes the state of Harmony, removes 'a' from its Province, and causes 'a' to enter a state of Pain. Object 'd' gains Province status. |
| 2 | t=2 | **Succumb (a)** | Object 'a' succumbs. This removes 'a's Pain, restores Harmony, and places 'a' back into both Province and Planet status. |
| 3 | t=3 | **Feast (d, b)** | Object 'd' feasts on Object 'b'. This breaks the 'd craves b' relationship (requires d to be in Province, and Harmony), causes 'd' to enter a state of Pain, and places 'b' into Province status. Harmony and 'd's Province status are lost. |
| 4 | t=4 | **Succumb (d)** | Object 'd' succumbs. This removes 'd's Pain, restores Harmony, and places 'd' back into both Province and Planet status. |
| 5 | t=5 | **Feast (b, c)** | Object 'b' feasts on Object 'c'. This breaks the 'b craves c' relationship (requires b to be in Province, and Harmony), causes 'b' to enter a state of Pain, and places 'c' into Province status. Harmony and 'b's Province status are lost. |
| 6 | t=6 | **Succumb (b)** | Object 'b' succumbs. This removes 'b's Pain, restores Harmony, and places 'b' back into both Province and Planet status. |
| 7 | t=7 | **Attack (a)** | Object 'a' attacks. (Requires 'a' to be in Province, 'a' to be a Planet, and Harmony). This removes Harmony, removes 'a' from Province/Planet status, and causes 'a' to enter a state of Pain. |
| 8 | t=8 | **Overcome (a, c)** | Object 'a' overcomes Object 'c'. (Requires 'a' to be in Pain and 'c' to be in Province). This removes 'a's Pain and 'c's Province status, restores Harmony, places 'a' into Province status, and establishes the new relationship: **'a craves c' (Goal Achieved).** |</blockquote>
