This plan details the sequence of actions required to establish the target craving relations ((craves a b), (craves b d), (craves d c)) among objects (a, b, c, d).

| Step | Time | Action PDDL | Human-Readable Action | Resulting Craving Relations |
| :--- | :--- | :---------- | :---------------------- | :-------------------------- |
| 1 | T=1 | (feast b c) | Object B Feasts upon Object C. | (b craves c) is removed. |
| 2 | T=2 | (succumb b) | Object B Succumbs (recovering Province, Planet, and Harmony). | |
| 3 | T=3 | (attack a) | Object A Attacks itself (gaining Pain, losing Province, Planet, and Harmony). | |
| 4 | T=4 | (overcome a b) | Object A Overcomes Object B (establishing **(craves a b)**). | (craves a b) |
| 5 | T=5 | (attack d) | Object D Attacks itself (gaining Pain, losing Province, Planet, and Harmony). | (craves a b) |
| 6 | T=6 | (overcome d c) | Object D Overcomes Object C (establishing **(craves d c)**). | (craves a b), (craves d c) |
| 7 | T=7 | (feast a b) | Object A Feasts upon Object B (losing the (craves a b) relation). | (craves d c) |
| 8 | T=8 | (succumb a) | Object A Succumbs (recovering Province, Planet, and Harmony). | (craves d c) |
| 9 | T=9 | (attack b) | Object B Attacks itself (gaining Pain, losing Province, Planet, and Harmony). | (craves d c) |
| 10 | T=10 | (overcome b d) | Object B Overcomes Object D (establishing **(craves b d)**). | (craves d c), (craves b d) |
| 11 | T=11 | (attack a) | Object A Attacks itself (gaining Pain, losing Province, Planet, and Harmony). | (craves d c), (craves b d) |
| 12 | T=12 | (overcome a b) | Object A Overcomes Object B (re-establishing **(craves a b)**). | **(craves a b), (craves b d), (craves d c)** |
