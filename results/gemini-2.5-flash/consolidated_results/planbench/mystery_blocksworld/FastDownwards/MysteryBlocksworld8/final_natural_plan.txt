Based on the PDDL domain, problem, and the resulting plan, here is the sequence of human-readable instructions required to achieve the goal state.

The goal is to establish a state where Object A craves Object D, and Object B craves Object C.

| Step | PDDL Action | Description of Action |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 1 | (feast c b) | Object C performs a Feast upon Object B. |
| 2 | (succumb c) | Object C Succumbs, restoring planetary Harmony. |
| 3 | (feast d a) | Object D performs a Feast upon Object A. |
| 4 | (succumb d) | Object D Succumbs, restoring planetary Harmony. |
| 5 | (attack a) | Object A performs an Attack. |
| 6 | (overcome a d) | Object A Overcomes Object D. (Goal 1 Achieved: A Craves D). |
| 7 | (attack b) | Object B performs an Attack. |
| 8 | (overcome b c) | Object B Overcomes Object C. (Goal 2 Achieved: B Craves C). |
