PROBLEM
------------------------------
I am playing with a set of objects. Here are the actions I can do

Paltry object_0 object_1 object_2.
Sip object_0 object_1 object_2.
Clip object_0 object_1 object_2.
Wretched object_0 object_1 object_2 object_3.
Memory object_0 object_1 object_2.
Tightfisted object_0 object_1 object_2.

I have the following restrictions on my actions:
To perform paltry action, the following facts need to be true: hand object_0, cats object_1, texture object_2, vase object_0 object_1, and next object_1 object_2
Once paltry is performed the following facts will be true: next object_0 object_2
Once paltry is performed the following facts will be false: vase object_0 object_1
To perform sip action, the following facts need to be true: hand object_0, cats object_1, texture object_2, next object_0 object_2, and next object_1 object_2
Once sip is performed the following facts will be true: vase object_0 object_1
Once sip is performed the following facts will be false: next object_0 object_2
To perform clip action, the following facts need to be true: hand object_0, sneeze object_1, texture object_2, next object_1 object_2, and next object_0 object_2
Once clip is performed the following facts will be true: vase object_0 object_1
Once clip is performed the following facts will be false: next object_0 object_2
To perform wretched action, the following facts need to be true: sneeze object_0, texture object_1, texture object_2, stupendous object_3, next object_0 object_1, collect object_1 object_3, and collect object_2 object_3
Once wretched is performed the following facts will be true: next object_0 object_2
Once wretched is performed the following facts will be false: next object_0 object_1
To perform memory action, the following facts need to be true: cats object_0, spring object_1, spring object_2, and next object_0 object_1
Once memory is performed the following facts will be true: next object_0 object_2
Once memory is performed the following facts will be false: next object_0 object_1
To perform tightfisted action, the following facts need to be true: hand object_0, sneeze object_1, texture object_2, next object_1 object_2, and vase object_0 object_1
Once tightfisted is performed the following facts will be true: next object_0 object_2
Once tightfisted is performed the following facts will be false: vase object_0 object_1

[STATEMENT]
As initial conditions I have that, cats object_0, cats object_1, collect object_6 object_2, collect object_7 object_3, hand object_8, next object_0 object_7, next object_1 object_7, next object_4 object_6, next object_5 object_7, next object_8 object_7, sneeze object_4, sneeze object_5, spring object_6, spring object_7, stupendous object_2, stupendous object_3, texture object_6 and texture object_7.
My goal is to have that next object_8 object_6.

NATURAL-PLAN sas_plan_1
------------------------------
This sequence of actions is designed to achieve the goal of establishing the relationship `(next object_8 object_6)`.

| Step | Time | Action | Details |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **1** | T=0:01 | **SIP(object_8, object_1, object_7)** | Execute the SIP operation using Object 8, Object 1, and Object 7. This requires Object 8 to be 'hand', Object 1 to be 'cats', and Object 7 to be 'texture', with both Object 8 and Object 1 currently 'next' to Object 7. Result: Object 8 and Object 1 are placed into a 'vase' configuration, and the existing 'next' connection between Object 8 and Object 7 is broken. |
| **2** | T=0:02 | **MEMORY(object_1, object_7, object_6)** | Execute the MEMORY operation on Object 1. This is possible because Object 1 is 'cats' and both Object 7 and Object 6 are 'spring', with Object 1 currently 'next' to Object 7. Result: The 'next' connection for Object 1 is shifted from Object 7 to Object 6. |
| **3** | T=0:03 | **PALTRY(object_8, object_1, object_6)** | Execute the PALTRY operation using Object 8, Object 1, and Object 6. This requires Object 8 to be 'hand', Object 1 to be 'cats', Object 6 to be 'texture', Object 8 and Object 1 to be in a 'vase' configuration, and Object 1 to be 'next' to Object 6. Result: The final required connection `(next object_8 object_6)` is established, and the 'vase' configuration between Object 8 and Object 1 is dissolved. |
