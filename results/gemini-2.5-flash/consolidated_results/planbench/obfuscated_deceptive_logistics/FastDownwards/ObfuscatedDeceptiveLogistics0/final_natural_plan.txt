This sequence of actions is designed to achieve the goal of establishing the relationship `(next object_8 object_6)`.

| Step | Time | Action | Details |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **1** | T=0:01 | **SIP(object_8, object_1, object_7)** | Execute the SIP operation using Object 8, Object 1, and Object 7. This requires Object 8 to be 'hand', Object 1 to be 'cats', and Object 7 to be 'texture', with both Object 8 and Object 1 currently 'next' to Object 7. Result: Object 8 and Object 1 are placed into a 'vase' configuration, and the existing 'next' connection between Object 8 and Object 7 is broken. |
| **2** | T=0:02 | **MEMORY(object_1, object_7, object_6)** | Execute the MEMORY operation on Object 1. This is possible because Object 1 is 'cats' and both Object 7 and Object 6 are 'spring', with Object 1 currently 'next' to Object 7. Result: The 'next' connection for Object 1 is shifted from Object 7 to Object 6. |
| **3** | T=0:03 | **PALTRY(object_8, object_1, object_6)** | Execute the PALTRY operation using Object 8, Object 1, and Object 6. This requires Object 8 to be 'hand', Object 1 to be 'cats', Object 6 to be 'texture', Object 8 and Object 1 to be in a 'vase' configuration, and Object 1 to be 'next' to Object 6. Result: The final required connection `(next object_8 object_6)` is established, and the 'vase' configuration between Object 8 and Object 1 is dissolved. |
