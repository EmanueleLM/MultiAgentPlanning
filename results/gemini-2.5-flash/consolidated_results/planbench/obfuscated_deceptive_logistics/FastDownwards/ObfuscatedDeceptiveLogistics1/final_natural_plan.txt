This is the required sequence of human-readable actions derived from the provided PDDL plan, domain, and problem definition.

### Goal: Ensure object\_7 is linked to object\_6 and object\_8 is linked to object\_6.

1.  **Memory** (object\_0, object\_6, object\_5)
    *   **Instruction:** Apply the Memory process to **object\_0**. Because **object\_0** has the *cats* property, and both **object\_6** and **object\_5** have the *spring* property, shift the *next* relationship of **object\_0** from **object\_6** to **object\_5**.
    *   **Effect:** `(next object_0 object_6)` is deleted; `(next object_0 object_5)` is added.

2.  **Sip** (object\_8, object\_0, object\_5)
    *   **Instruction:** Perform the Sip operation involving **object\_8**, **object\_0**, and **object\_5**. This is possible because **object\_8** has the *hand* property, **object\_0** has the *cats* property, **object\_5** has the *texture* property, and both **object\_8** and **object\_0** are linked *next* to **object\_5**.
    *   **Effect:** The *next* relationship of **object\_8** to **object\_5** is deleted; a *vase* relationship between **object\_8** and **object\_0** is created.

3.  **Memory** (object\_0, object\_5, object\_6)
    *   **Instruction:** Re-apply the Memory process to **object\_0**. Shift the *next* relationship of **object\_0** back from **object\_5** to **object\_6**.
    *   **Effect:** `(next object_0 object_5)` is deleted; `(next object_0 object_6)` is added.

4.  **Paltry** (object\_8, object\_0, object\_6)
    *   **Instruction:** Execute the Paltry operation using **object\_8**, **object\_0**, and **object\_6**. This is possible because **object\_8** has the *hand* property, **object\_0** has the *cats* property, **object\_6** has the *texture* property, **object\_8** has a *vase* relationship with **object\_0**, and **object\_0** is linked *next* to **object\_6**.
    *   **Effect:** The *vase* relationship between **object\_8** and **object\_0** is deleted; the desired *next* relationship between **object\_8** and **object\_6** is established.

The goal state (object\_7 linked to object\_6, and object\_8 linked to object\_6) is now achieved.
