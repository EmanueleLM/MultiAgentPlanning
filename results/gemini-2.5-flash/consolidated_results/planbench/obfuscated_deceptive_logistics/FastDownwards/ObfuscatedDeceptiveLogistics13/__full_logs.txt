PROBLEM
------------------------------
I am playing with a set of objects. Here are the actions I can do

Paltry object_0 object_1 object_2.
Sip object_0 object_1 object_2.
Clip object_0 object_1 object_2.
Wretched object_0 object_1 object_2 object_3.

Tightfisted object_0 object_1 object_2.

I have the following restrictions on my actions:
To perform paltry action, the following facts need to be true: hand object_0, cats object_1, texture object_2, vase object_0 object_1, and next object_1 object_2
Once paltry is performed the following facts will be true: next object_0 object_2
Once paltry is performed the following facts will be false: vase object_0 object_1
To perform sip action, the following facts need to be true: hand object_0, cats object_1, texture object_2, next object_0 object_2, and next object_1 object_2
Once sip is performed the following facts will be true: vase object_0 object_1
Once sip is performed the following facts will be false: next object_0 object_2
To perform clip action, the following facts need to be true: hand object_0, sneeze object_1, texture object_2, next object_1 object_2, and next object_0 object_2
Once clip is performed the following facts will be true: vase object_0 object_1
Once clip is performed the following facts will be false: next object_0 object_2
To perform wretched action, the following facts need to be true: sneeze object_0, texture object_1, texture object_2, stupendous object_3, next object_0 object_1, collect object_1 object_3, and collect object_2 object_3
Once wretched is performed the following facts will be true: next object_0 object_2
Once wretched is performed the following facts will be false: next object_0 object_1

[STATEMENT]
As initial conditions I have that, cats object_0, collect object_5 object_1, collect object_6 object_1, collect object_7 object_2, collect object_8 object_2, hand object_10, hand object_11, hand object_9, next object_0 object_5, next object_10 object_5, next object_11 object_5, next object_3 object_6, next object_4 object_7, next object_9 object_8, sneeze object_3, sneeze object_4, spring object_5, spring object_7, stupendous object_1, stupendous object_2, texture object_5, texture object_6, texture object_7 and texture object_8.
My goal is to have that next object_10 object_8, next object_11 object_7 and next object_9 object_6.

NATURAL-PLAN sas_plan_1
------------------------------
This is the sequence of actions required to achieve the goal state, based on the provided PDDL plan. Each step is assumed to take one unit of time.

| Step | Time | Action Type | Instruction |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 1 | T=1 | **Clip** | Agent **object\_11** performs the Clip action using **object\_5** and **object\_9**. (Establishes vase(object\_11, object\_5)). |
| 2 | T=2 | **Wretched** | Object **object\_5** (Sneeze) performs the Wretched action, moving its 'next' association from **object\_9** to **object\_8**, facilitated by **object\_3** (Stupendous). |
| 3 | T=3 | **Tightfisted** | Agent **object\_11** performs the Tightfisted action, disassembling the vase connection with **object\_5** and establishing a 'next' association with **object\_8**. |
| 4 | T=4 | **Clip** | Agent **object\_12** performs the Clip action using **object\_4** and **object\_6**. (Establishes vase(object\_12, object\_4)). |
| 5 | T=5 | **Sip** | Agent **object\_11** performs the Sip action using **object\_0** and **object\_8**. (Establishes vase(object\_11, object\_0)). |
| 6 | T=6 | **Sip** | Agent **object\_10** performs the Sip action using **object\_0** and **object\_8**. (Establishes vase(object\_10, object\_0)). |
| 7 | T=7 | **Memory** | Object **object\_0** (Cats) performs the Memory action, moving its 'next' association from **object\_8** (Spring) to **object\_6** (Spring). |
| 8 | T=8 | **Paltry** | Agent **object\_11** performs the Paltry action, disassembling the vase connection with **object\_0** and establishing a 'next' association with **object\_6**. |
| 9 | T=9 | **Clip** | Agent **object\_11** performs the Clip action using **object\_4** and **object\_6**. (Establishes vase(object\_11, object\_4)). |
| 10 | T=10 | **Paltry** | Agent **object\_10** performs the Paltry action, disassembling the vase connection with **object\_0** and establishing a 'next' association with **object\_6**. |
| 11 | T=11 | **Clip** | Agent **object\_10** performs the Clip action using **object\_4** and **object\_6**. (Establishes vase(object\_10, object\_4)). |
| 12 | T=12 | **Wretched** | Object **object\_4** (Sneeze) performs the Wretched action, moving its 'next' association from **object\_6** to **object\_7**, facilitated by **object\_2** (Stupendous). |
| 13 | T=13 | **Tightfisted** | Agent **object\_12** performs the Tightfisted action, disassembling the vase connection with **object\_4** and establishing a 'next' association with **object\_7**. |
| 14 | T=14 | **Tightfisted** | Agent **object\_11** performs the Tightfisted action, disassembling the vase connection with **object\_4** and establishing a 'next' association with **object\_7**. |
| 15 | T=15 | **Tightfisted** | Agent **object\_10** performs the Tightfisted action, disassembling the vase connection with **object\_4** and establishing a 'next' association with **object\_7**. |

***
The goal is achieved: objects **object\_10**, **object\_11**, and **object\_12** are now all associated 'next' to **object\_7**.
