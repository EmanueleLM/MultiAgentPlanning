This is the sequence of human-readable actions derived from the PDDL plan, starting from time T=1, with each action incurring a unit cost.

| Time | Action | Description |
| :--- | :----- | :---------- |
| T=1 | **Clip** (Object 12, Object 5, Object 9) | Object 12 (hand) pairs with Object 5 (sneeze) in a vase, removing Object 12's proximity link to Object 9 (texture). |
| T=2 | **Clip** (Object 10, Object 5, Object 9) | Object 10 (hand) pairs with Object 5 (sneeze) in a vase, removing Object 10's proximity link to Object 9 (texture). |
| T=3 | **Sip** (Object 13, Object 1, Object 6) | Object 13 (hand) pairs with Object 1 (cats) in a vase, removing Object 13's proximity link to Object 6 (texture). |
| T=4 | **Wretched** (Object 4, Object 7, Object 6, Object 2) | Object 4 (sneeze) moves from proximity to Object 7 to proximity to Object 6, using the shared collection relationship relative to Object 2 (stupendous). |
| T=5 | **Wretched** (Object 5, Object 9, Object 8, Object 3) | Object 5 (sneeze) moves from proximity to Object 9 to proximity to Object 8, using the shared collection relationship relative to Object 3 (stupendous). |
| T=6 | **Tightfisted** (Object 12, Object 5, Object 8) | Object 12 (hand) moves next to Object 8 (texture), dissolving its vase pairing with Object 5 (sneeze). |
| T=7 | **Clip** (Object 11, Object 5, Object 8) | Object 11 (hand) pairs with Object 5 (sneeze) in a vase, removing Object 11's proximity link to Object 8 (texture). |
| T=8 | **Tightfisted** (Object 10, Object 5, Object 8) | Object 10 (hand) moves next to Object 8 (texture), dissolving its vase pairing with Object 5 (sneeze). |
| T=9 | **Memory** (Object 1, Object 6, Object 8) | Object 1 (cats) moves from proximity to Object 6 (spring) to proximity to Object 8 (spring). |
| T=10 | **Paltry** (Object 13, Object 1, Object 8) | Object 13 (hand) moves next to Object 8 (texture), dissolving its vase pairing with Object 1 (cats). |
| T=11 | **Clip** (Object 13, Object 5, Object 8) | Object 13 (hand) pairs with Object 5 (sneeze) in a vase, removing Object 13's proximity link to Object 8 (texture). |
| T=12 | **Wretched** (Object 5, Object 8, Object 9, Object 3) | Object 5 (sneeze) moves from proximity to Object 8 to proximity to Object 9, using the shared collection relationship relative to Object 3 (stupendous). |
| T=13 | **Tightfisted** (Object 13, Object 5, Object 9) | Object 13 (hand) moves next to Object 9 (texture), dissolving its vase pairing with Object 5 (sneeze). |
| T=14 | **Tightfisted** (Object 11, Object 5, Object 9) | Object 11 (hand) moves next to Object 9 (texture), dissolving its vase pairing with Object 5 (sneeze). |
| T=15 | **Sip** (Object 12, Object 1, Object 8) | Object 12 (hand) pairs with Object 1 (cats) in a vase, removing Object 12's proximity link to Object 8 (texture). |
| T=16 | **Sip** (Object 10, Object 1, Object 8) | Object 10 (hand) pairs with Object 1 (cats) in a vase, removing Object 10's proximity link to Object 8 (texture). |
| T=17 | **Memory** (Object 1, Object 8, Object 6) | Object 1 (cats) moves from proximity to Object 8 (spring) to proximity to Object 6 (spring). |
| T=18 | **Paltry** (Object 12, Object 1, Object 6) | Object 12 (hand) moves next to Object 6 (texture), dissolving its vase pairing with Object 1 (cats). |
| T=19 | **Clip** (Object 12, Object 4, Object 6) | Object 12 (hand) pairs with Object 4 (sneeze) in a vase, removing Object 12's proximity link to Object 6 (texture). |
| T=20 | **Wretched** (Object 4, Object 6, Object 7, Object 2) | Object 4 (sneeze) moves from proximity to Object 6 to proximity to Object 7, using the shared collection relationship relative to Object 2 (stupendous). |
| T=21 | **Tightfisted** (Object 12, Object 4, Object 7) | Object 12 (hand) moves next to Object 7 (texture), dissolving its vase pairing with Object 4 (sneeze). |
| T=22 | **Paltry** (Object 10, Object 1, Object 6) | Object 10 (hand) moves next to Object 6 (texture), dissolving its vase pairing with Object 1 (cats). |

The goal state is achieved (Next(Object 10, Object 6), Next(Object 11, Object 9), Next(Object 12, Object 7), Next(Object 13, Object 9)). Total cost is 22.
