This plan outlines the sequence of 12 actions required to achieve the goal configuration.

1.  **CLIP** object\_11 with object\_5, targeting object\_9. (Result: object\_11 is no longer next to object\_9, establishing a `vase` link with object\_5.)
2.  **WRETCHED** object\_5, moving its 'next' association from object\_9 to object\_8, using constraint object\_3. (Result: object\_5 is now next to object\_8.)
3.  **TIGHTFISTED** object\_11 with object\_5, targeting object\_8. (Result: object\_11 is now next to object\_8, dissolving the `vase` link.)
4.  **CLIP** object\_10 with object\_4, targeting object\_7. (Result: object\_10 is no longer next to object\_7, establishing a `vase` link with object\_4.)
5.  **SIP** object\_12 with object\_1, targeting object\_8. (Result: object\_12 is no longer next to object\_8, establishing a `vase` link with object\_1.)
6.  **MEMORY** object\_1, moving its 'next' association from object\_8 to object\_6. (Result: object\_1 is now next to object\_6.)
7.  **WRETCHED** object\_4, moving its 'next' association from object\_7 to object\_6, using constraint object\_2. (Result: object\_4 is now next to object\_6.)
8.  **TIGHTFISTED** object\_10 with object\_4, targeting object\_6. (Result: object\_10 is now next to object\_6, dissolving the `vase` link.)
9.  **PALTRY** object\_12 with object\_1, targeting object\_6. (Result: object\_12 is now next to object\_6, dissolving the `vase` link.)
10. **CLIP** object\_12 with object\_4, targeting object\_6. (Result: object\_12 is no longer next to object\_6, establishing a `vase` link with object\_4.)
11. **WRETCHED** object\_4, moving its 'next' association from object\_6 to object\_7, using constraint object\_2. (Result: object\_4 is now next to object\_7.)
12. **TIGHTFISTED** object\_12 with object\_4, targeting object\_7. (Result: object\_12 is now next to object\_7, dissolving the `vase` link.)
