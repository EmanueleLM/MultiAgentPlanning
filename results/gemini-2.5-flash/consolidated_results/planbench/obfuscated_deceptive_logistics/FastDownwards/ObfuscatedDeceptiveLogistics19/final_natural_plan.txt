This is the sequence of actions required to achieve the goal state:

| Step | Action Name | Parameters | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 1 | Wretched | `object_4`, `object_10`, `object_8`, `object_2` | Modify the 'next' relationship for `object_4` using the Wretched procedure. Remove the connection to `object_10` and establish a new connection to `object_8`. (Requires `object_4` to be 'sneeze', `object_10` and `object_8` to be 'texture', and `object_2` to be 'stupendous', and shared 'collect' properties.) |
| 2 | Clip | `object_11`, `object_4`, `object_8` | Execute the Clip operation using the handler `object_11` and `object_4` relative to `object_8`. This establishes a 'vase' relationship between `object_11` and `object_4`, and removes the existing 'next' connection for `object_11`. |
| 3 | Wretched | `object_4`, `object_8`, `object_9`, `object_2` | Modify the 'next' relationship for `object_4` again. Remove the connection to `object_8` and establish a new connection to `object_9`. |
| 4 | Tightfisted | `object_11`, `object_4`, `object_9` | Execute the Tightfisted operation using `object_11` and `object_4` relative to `object_9`. This transfers the 'next' property for `object_11` to `object_9` and removes the existing 'vase' relationship between `object_11` and `object_4`. **(Goal: next object_11 object_9 achieved)** |
