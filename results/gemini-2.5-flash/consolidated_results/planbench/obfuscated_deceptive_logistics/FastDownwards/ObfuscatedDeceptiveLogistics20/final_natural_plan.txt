This plan outlines the required sequence of steps to achieve the goal `(next object_12 object_11)` using the defined actions.

| Step | Time | Action | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 1 | 00:00 | **WRETCHED** (object\_5, object\_9, object\_10, object\_3) | Redirect Object 5's connection from Object 9 to Object 10. (Removes `(next object_5 object_9)`, adds `(next object_5 object_10)`). |
| 2 | 00:01 | **CLIP** (object\_12, object\_5, object\_10) | Establish a `vase` association between Object 12 and Object 5, simultaneously breaking Object 12's existing `next` connection to Object 10. (Adds `(vase object_12 object_5)`, removes `(next object_12 object_10)`). |
| 3 | 00:02 | **WRETCHED** (object\_5, object\_10, object\_11, object\_3) | Redirect Object 5's connection from Object 10 to Object 11. (Removes `(next object_5 object_10)`, adds `(next object_5 object_11)`). |
| 4 | 00:03 | **TIGHTFISTED** (object\_12, object\_5, object\_11) | Dissolve the `vase` association between Object 12 and Object 5, and establish the final required connection: Object 12 linked to Object 11. (Removes `(vase object_12 object_5)`, adds `(next object_12 object_11)`). |

**Goal Achieved:** `(next object_12 object_11)`
