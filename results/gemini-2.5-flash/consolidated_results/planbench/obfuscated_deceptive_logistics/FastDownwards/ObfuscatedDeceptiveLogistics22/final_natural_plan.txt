This is the sequence of human-readable instructions derived from the PDDL plan, aimed at achieving the goal state: `(next object_11 object_7)` and `(next object_12 object_8)`.

1. **Clip** `object_12`, `object_4`, and `object_10`.
2. **Wretched** `object_4` from `object_10` to `object_8`, mediated by `object_2`.
3. **Tightfisted** `object_12`, `object_4`, and `object_8`.
4. **Wretched** `object_3` from `object_7` to `object_6`, mediated by `object_1`.
5. **Clip** `object_11`, `object_3`, and `object_6`.
6. **Wretched** `object_3` from `object_6` to `object_7`, mediated by `object_1`.
7. **Tightfisted** `object_11`, `object_3`, and `object_7`.
