NATURAL-PLAN sas_plan_1
------------------------------
This plan details the sequence of 11 actions required to achieve the goal state `(next object_11 object_10)`.

1. **Execute Wretched:** Use object 3, moving its association from object 7 to object 6, based on the properties shared with object 1.
   *(Action: wretched object_3 object_7 object_6 object_1)*

2. **Execute Clip:** Use object 11 and object 3 to establish a `vase` connection between them, targeting object 6.
   *(Action: clip object_11 object_3 object_6)*

3. **Execute Wretched:** Use object 3, moving its association from object 6 to object 5, based on the properties shared with object 1.
   *(Action: wretched object_3 object_6 object_5 object_1)*

4. **Execute Tightfisted:** Use object 11 and object 3 to break the `vase` connection and establish a `next` connection for object 11 pointing to object 5.
   *(Action: tightfisted object_11 object_3 object_5)*

5. **Execute Memory:** Use object 0, moving its `next` connection from object 8 to object 5.
   *(Action: memory object_0 object_8 object_5)*

6. **Execute Sip:** Use object 11 and object 0 to establish a `vase` connection between them, targeting object 5. This removes the `next` connection of object 11 to object 5.
   *(Action: sip object_11 object_0 object_5)*

7. **Execute Memory:** Use object 0, moving its `next` connection from object 5 back to object 8.
   *(Action: memory object_0 object_5 object_8)*

8. **Execute Paltry:** Use object 11 and object 0 to break the `vase` connection and establish a `next` connection for object 11 pointing to object 8.
   *(Action: paltry object_11 object_0 object_8)*

9. **Execute Clip:** Use object 11 and object 4 to establish a `vase` connection between them, targeting object 8. This removes the `next` connection of object 11 to object 8.
   *(Action: clip object_11 object_4 object_8)*

10. **Execute Wretched:** Use object 4, moving its association from object 8 to object 10, based on the properties shared with object 2.
    *(Action: wretched object_4 object_8 object_10 object_2)*

11. **Execute Tightfisted:** Use object 11 and object 4 to break the `vase` connection and establish the final required `next` connection for object 11 pointing to object 10.
    *(Action: tightfisted object_11 object_4 object_10)*

This is the sequence of actions required to achieve the goal state:

| Step | Action Name | Parameters | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 1 | Wretched | `object_4`, `object_10`, `object_8`, `object_2` | Modify the 'next' relationship for `object_4` using the Wretched procedure. Remove the connection to `object_10` and establish a new connection to `object_8`. (Requires `object_4` to be 'sneeze', `object_10` and `object_8` to be 'texture', and `object_2` to be 'stupendous', and shared 'collect' properties.) |
| 2 | Clip | `object_11`, `object_4`, `object_8` | Execute the Clip operation using the handler `object_11` and `object_4` relative to `object_8`. This establishes a 'vase' relationship between `object_11` and `object_4`, and removes the existing 'next' connection for `object_11`. |
| 3 | Wretched | `object_4`, `object_8`, `object_9`, `object_2` | Modify the 'next' relationship for `object_4` again. Remove the connection to `object_8` and establish a new connection to `object_9`. |
| 4 | Tightfisted | `object_11`, `object_4`, `object_9` | Execute the Tightfisted operation using `object_11` and `object_4` relative to `object_9`. This transfers the 'next' property for `object_11` to `object_9` and removes the existing 'vase' relationship between `object_11` and `object_4`. **(Goal: next object_11 object_9 achieved)** |

NATURAL-PLAN sas_plan_1
------------------------------
This plan outlines the required sequence of steps to achieve the goal `(next object_12 object_11)` using the defined actions.

| Step | Time | Action | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 1 | 00:00 | **WRETCHED** (object\_5, object\_9, object\_10, object\_3) | Redirect Object 5's connection from Object 9 to Object 10. (Removes `(next object_5 object_9)`, adds `(next object_5 object_10)`). |
| 2 | 00:01 | **CLIP** (object\_12, object\_5, object\_10) | Establish a `vase` association between Object 12 and Object 5, simultaneously breaking Object 12's existing `next` connection to Object 10. (Adds `(vase object_12 object_5)`, removes `(next object_12 object_10)`). |
| 3 | 00:02 | **WRETCHED** (object\_5, object\_10, object\_11, object\_3) | Redirect Object 5's connection from Object 10 to Object 11. (Removes `(next object_5 object_10)`, adds `(next object_5 object_11)`). |
| 4 | 00:03 | **TIGHTFISTED** (object\_12, object\_5, object\_11) | Dissolve the `vase` association between Object 12 and Object 5, and establish the final required connection: Object 12 linked to Object 11. (Removes `(vase object_12 object_5)`, adds `(next object_12 object_11)`). |

**Goal Achieved:** `(next object_12 object_11)`
