This plan details the sequence of 24 operations required to reorganize the links between the objects, moving the handled objects (Object 12, 13, 14) to their desired final positions.

### Operational Plan

1. **Wretched Operation:** Shift Object 4 (sneeze) from being `next` to Object 7 to being `next` to Object 8. (Requires Object 7 and Object 8 to be textures collected for Object 2).
2. **Clip Operation:** Establish a `vase` connection between Object 14 (hand) and Object 4 (sneeze). Object 14 is no longer `next` to Object 8.
3. **Clip Operation:** Establish a `vase` connection between Object 13 (hand) and Object 4 (sneeze). Object 13 is no longer `next` to Object 8.
4. **Wretched Operation:** Shift Object 4 (sneeze) from being `next` to Object 8 to being `next` to Object 6. (Requires Object 8 and Object 6 to be textures collected for Object 2).
5. **Tightfisted Operation:** Break the `vase` connection between Object 14 and Object 4. Link Object 14 (hand) `next` to Object 6 (texture).
6. **Tightfisted Operation:** Break the `vase` connection between Object 13 and Object 4. Link Object 13 (hand) `next` to Object 6 (texture).
7. **Sip Operation:** Establish a `vase` connection between Object 14 (hand) and Object 1 (cats). Object 14 is no longer `next` to Object 6.
8. **Sip Operation:** Establish a `vase` connection between Object 13 (hand) and Object 1 (cats). Object 13 is no longer `next` to Object 6.
9. **Memory Operation:** Shift Object 1 (cats) from being `next` to Object 6 (spring) to being `next` to Object 9 (spring).
10. **Paltry Operation:** Break the `vase` connection between Object 14 and Object 1. Link Object 14 (hand) `next` to Object 9 (texture).
11. **Paltry Operation:** Break the `vase` connection between Object 13 and Object 1. Link Object 13 (hand) `next` to Object 9 (texture).
12. **Wretched Operation:** Shift Object 5 (sneeze) from being `next` to Object 10 to being `next` to Object 11. (Requires Object 10 and Object 11 to be textures collected for Object 3).
13. **Clip Operation:** Establish a `vase` connection between Object 12 (hand) and Object 5 (sneeze). Object 12 is no longer `next` to Object 11.
14. **Wretched Operation:** Shift Object 5 (sneeze) from being `next` to Object 11 to being `next` to Object 9. (Requires Object 11 and Object 9 to be textures collected for Object 3).
15. **Clip Operation:** Establish a `vase` connection between Object 14 (hand) and Object 5 (sneeze). Object 14 is no longer `next` to Object 9.
16. **Clip Operation:** Establish a `vase` connection between Object 13 (hand) and Object 5 (sneeze). Object 13 is no longer `next` to Object 9.
17. **Tightfisted Operation:** Break the `vase` connection between Object 12 and Object 5. Link Object 12 (hand) `next` to Object 9 (texture).
18. **Wretched Operation:** Shift Object 5 (sneeze) from being `next` to Object 9 to being `next` to Object 10. (Requires Object 9 and Object 10 to be textures collected for Object 3).
19. **Tightfisted Operation:** Break the `vase` connection between Object 13 and Object 5. Link Object 13 (hand) `next` to Object 10 (texture).
20. **Wretched Operation:** Shift Object 5 (sneeze) from being `next` to Object 10 to being `next` to Object 11. (Requires Object 10 and Object 11 to be textures collected for Object 3).
21. **Tightfisted Operation:** Break the `vase` connection between Object 14 and Object 5. Link Object 14 (hand) `next` to Object 11 (texture).
22. **Sip Operation:** Establish a `vase` connection between Object 12 (hand) and Object 1 (cats). Object 12 is no longer `next` to Object 9.
23. **Memory Operation:** Shift Object 1 (cats) from being `next` to Object 9 (spring) to being `next` to Object 6 (spring).
24. **Paltry Operation:** Break the `vase` connection between Object 12 and Object 1. Link Object 12 (hand) `next` to Object 6 (texture).

The goal state is reached: Object 12 is `next` to Object 6, Object 13 is `next` to Object 10, and Object 14 is `next` to Object 11.
