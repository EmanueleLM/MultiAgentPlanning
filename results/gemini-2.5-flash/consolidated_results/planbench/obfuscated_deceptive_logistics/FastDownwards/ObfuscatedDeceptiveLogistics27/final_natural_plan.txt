This is the sequence of 17 actions required to achieve the goal state:

1.  **Wretched object\_5 object\_10 object\_11 object\_3:** Object `object_5` (which sneezes) shifts its current `next` connection from textured object `object_10` to textured object `object_11`.
2.  **Clip object\_12 object\_5 object\_11:** Held object `object_12` establishes a `vase` link with `object_5` (which sneezes), detaching from its current `next` connection to `object_11`.
3.  **Wretched object\_5 object\_11 object\_10 object\_3:** Object `object_5` (which sneezes) shifts its `next` connection from textured object `object_11` back to textured object `object_10`.
4.  **Tightfisted object\_12 object\_5 object\_10:** Held object `object_12` terminates its `vase` link with `object_5` (which sneezes) and establishes a `next` connection to textured object `object_10`.
5.  **Wretched object\_5 object\_10 object\_9 object\_3:** Object `object_5` (which sneezes) shifts its `next` connection from textured object `object_10` to textured object `object_9`.
6.  **Wretched object\_4 object\_7 object\_8 object\_2:** Object `object_4` (which sneezes) shifts its `next` connection from textured object `object_7` to textured object `object_8`.
7.  **Clip object\_14 object\_4 object\_8:** Held object `object_14` establishes a `vase` link with `object_4` (which sneezes), detaching from its current `next` connection to `object_8`.
8.  **Wretched object\_4 object\_8 object\_6 object\_2:** Object `object_4` (which sneezes) shifts its `next` connection from textured object `object_8` to textured object `object_6`.
9.  **Tightfisted object\_14 object\_4 object\_6:** Held object `object_14` terminates its `vase` link with `object_4` (which sneezes) and establishes a `next` connection to textured object `object_6`.
10. **Sip object\_14 object\_0 object\_6:** Held object `object_14` establishes a `vase` link with `object_0` (a cat), detaching from its current `next` connection to `object_6`.
11. **Sip object\_13 object\_0 object\_6:** Held object `object_13` establishes a `vase` link with `object_0` (a cat), detaching from its current `next` connection to `object_6`.
12. **Memory object\_0 object\_6 object\_9:** Object `object_0` (a cat) updates its `next` connection, shifting from spring object `object_6` to spring object `object_9`.
13. **Paltry object\_14 object\_0 object\_9:** Held object `object_14` takes the `next` connection to textured object `object_9`, severing its previous `vase` link with `object_0` (a cat).
14. **Paltry object\_13 object\_0 object\_9:** Held object `object_13` takes the `next` connection to textured object `object_9`, severing its previous `vase` link with `object_0` (a cat).
15. **Clip object\_13 object\_5 object\_9:** Held object `object_13` establishes a `vase` link with `object_5` (which sneezes), detaching from its current `next` connection to `object_9`.
16. **Wretched object\_5 object\_9 object\_10 object\_3:** Object `object_5` (which sneezes) shifts its `next` connection from textured object `object_9` back to textured object `object_10`.
17. **Tightfisted object\_13 object\_5 object\_10:** Held object `object_13` terminates its `vase` link with `object_5` (which sneezes) and establishes a `next` connection to textured object `object_10`.
