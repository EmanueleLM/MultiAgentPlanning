This is the sequence of human-readable actions required to achieve the goal:

| Step | Time | Action | Details |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 1 | T=0:00 | **CLIP** | Use Object 9, Object 4, and Object 7. This establishes the `(vase object_9 object_4)` state, removing the previous link `(next object_9 object_7)`. |
| 2 | T=0:01 | **WRETCHED** | Use Object 4, Object 7, Object 8, and Object 2. This action re-establishes a sequential link for Object 4, setting `(next object_4 object_8)`, and removing the link `(next object_4 object_7)`. |
| 3 | T=0:02 | **TIGHTFISTED** | Use Object 9, Object 4, and Object 8. This action achieves the goal state `(next object_9 object_8)` by leveraging the intermediate `(vase object_9 object_4)` and `(next object_4 object_8)` states. It also removes the `(vase object_9 object_4)` state. |

**Goal Achieved:** `(next object_9 object_8)` is established.
