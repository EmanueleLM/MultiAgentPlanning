This sequence of instructions translates the PDDL plan into human-readable actions, achieving the desired goal state (where `next object_10 object_5` and `next object_9 object_7`). Each action incurs a unit cost of 1.

| Step | Time | Action Translation |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 1 | Unit Cost 1 | Execute the **Clip** action on `object_9`, `object_4`, and `object_8`. This establishes a temporary linkage (`vase`) between `object_9` and `object_4`, while disconnecting `object_9` from `object_8`. |
| 2 | Unit Cost 2 | Execute the **Wretched** action, focusing on `object_4`, `object_8`, `object_7`, and `object_2`. This modifies the successor of `object_4` from `object_8` to `object_7`, facilitated by their shared association with the stupendous item `object_2`. |
| 3 | Unit Cost 3 | Execute the **Tightfisted** action on `object_9`, `object_4`, and `object_7`. This utilizes the temporary linkage established in Step 1 and the new successor relationship established in Step 2 to finalize the required linkage: `object_9` is now connected to `object_7`. The temporary `vase` linkage is removed. |
