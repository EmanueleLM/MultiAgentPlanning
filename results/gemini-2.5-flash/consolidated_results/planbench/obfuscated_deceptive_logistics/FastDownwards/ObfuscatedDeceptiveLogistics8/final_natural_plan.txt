This plan details the sequence of actions required to achieve the joint goal `(next object_10 object_6)` and `(next object_9 object_6)`.

| Step | Action Name | Arguments | Human-Readable Instruction |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 1 | **Clip** | `object_9`, `object_3`, `object_5` | Perform the **Clip** operation involving `object_9`, `object_3`, and `object_5`. This creates a `vase` link between `object_9` and `object_3`, removing the 'next' link from `object_9` to `object_5`. |
| 2 | **Clip** | `object_10`, `object_3`, `object_5` | Perform the **Clip** operation involving `object_10`, `object_3`, and `object_5`. This creates a `vase` link between `object_10` and `object_3`, removing the 'next' link from `object_10` to `object_5`. |
| 3 | **Wretched** | `object_3`, `object_5`, `object_6`, `object_1` | Execute the **Wretched** process using `object_3`, `object_5`, `object_6`, and `object_1`. This shifts the 'next' association of `object_3` from `object_5` to `object_6`. |
| 4 | **Tightfisted** | `object_9`, `object_3`, `object_6` | Execute the **Tightfisted** procedure involving `object_9`, `object_3`, and `object_6`. This establishes the desired 'next' link between `object_9` and `object_6`, dissolving the `vase` link between `object_9` and `object_3`. |
| 5 | **Tightfisted** | `object_10`, `object_3`, `object_6` | Execute the **Tightfisted** procedure involving `object_10`, `object_3`, and `object_6`. This establishes the desired 'next' link between `object_10` and `object_6`, dissolving the `vase` link between `object_10` and `object_3`. |
