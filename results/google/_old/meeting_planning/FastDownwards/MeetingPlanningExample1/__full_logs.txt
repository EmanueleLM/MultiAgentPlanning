PROBLEM
------------------------------
You are visiting San Francisco for the day and want to meet as many friends as possible. Solve the problem by considering various different schedules and picking the best one to optimize your goals.

Travel distances (in minutes):
Marina District to Mission District: 20.
Mission District to Marina District: 19.

CONSTRAINTS: You arrive at Marina District at 9:00AM. Stephanie will be at Mission District from 10:30AM to 1:30PM. You'd like to meet Stephanie for a minimum of 120 minutes.

Your response should start with 'SOLUTION:'.

NATURAL-PLAN sas_plan_5
------------------------------
1) Travel: From Marina District to Mission District
   - Depart: 9:00 AM (arrival at Marina District)
   - Travel duration: 20 minutes
   - Arrive Mission District: 9:20 AM
   - (This corresponds to action travel-you-marina-to-mission-t0-t20)
   
2) Wait: Stay at Mission District until Stephanie is available
   - Wait period: 9:20 AM → 10:30 AM
   - Duration: 70 minutes
   - (This corresponds to action wait-you-t20-t90)

3) Meet: Meet Stephanie at Mission District
   - Meeting period: 10:30 AM → 12:30 PM
   - Meeting duration: 120 minutes (meets the minimum required)
   - Stephanie's availability: 10:30 AM → 1:30 PM (meeting is within this window)
   - (This corresponds to action meet-you-stephanie-t90-t210)

Outcome:
- Goal satisfied: you meet Stephanie for 120 minutes within her availability.
- Total travel cost/time: 20 minutes.
