1) travel-richmond-presidio-for s795 traveler
- Action (natural language): The traveler goes from Richmond District to the Presidio in order to arrive for the chosen meeting start time s795.
- Times/duration: s795 = 795 minutes = 13:15. Travel time Richmond → Presidio = 7 minutes, so the traveler should depart Richmond at 13:08 and arrive at Presidio at 13:15.

- Effect: traveler is at Presidio by 13:15 and is marked as arrived_for s795.

2) meet-at-presidio s795 d105 sarah sarah
- Action (natural language, interpreted per specification): A meeting at the Presidio starting at s795 (13:15) for duration d105 (105 minutes) takes place between the traveler and Sarah.
- Times/duration: start 13:15, duration 105 minutes → end at 15:00. This fits Sarah’s availability window (available until 15:15) and meets the required minimum meeting duration (105 minutes).
- Preconditions satisfied: at 13:15 both participants are at Presidio (Sarah was already at Presidio; the traveler arrived there by step 1), arrived_for(s795) holds, and can_meet(s795,d105) holds.
- Effect / outcome: the meeting is achieved (met = true).
