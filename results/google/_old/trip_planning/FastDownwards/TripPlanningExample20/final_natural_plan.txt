Human-readable action sequence derived from the PDDL plan (steps match the plan exactly):

1) Step 1 — start-at budapest
   - Action (PDDL): start-at budapest
   - Description: Initialize the itinerary by starting at Budapest. This sets the agent's location to Budapest and marks Budapest as visited.
   - Time/duration: instantaneous at time 0 (no day consumption in this action).

2) Step 2 — start-at dubrovnik
   - Action (PDDL): start-at dubrovnik
   - Description: Initialize the itinerary by starting at Dubrovnik. This sets the agent's location to Dubrovnik and marks Dubrovnik as visited.
   - Time/duration: instantaneous immediately after Step 1 (no day consumption in this action).

3) Step 3 — start-at istanbul
   - Action (PDDL): start-at istanbul
   - Description: Initialize the itinerary by starting at Istanbul. This sets the agent's location to Istanbul and marks Istanbul as visited.
   - Time/duration: instantaneous immediately after Step 2 (no day consumption in this action).

Outcome: After these three actions, all three required cities (Budapest, Dubrovnik, Istanbul) are marked visited and the PDDL goal is satisfied. Total plan cost reported by the planner: 3.

Notes:
- The plan contains only the three start-at actions and uses no flight or day-consumption actions; therefore no direct flights are executed (which is consistent with the constraint “only direct flights” because no commuting flights were needed).
- The actions as given do not allocate or consume the 12 travel days; they simply mark the cities as visited. If you require explicit assignment of the 12 days (e.g., 6 days in Budapest, 3 in Dubrovnik, 5 in Istanbul) or use of flight actions between cities, a different plan with visit and/or fly actions would be needed.
