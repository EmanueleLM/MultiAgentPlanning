Human-readable step-by-step execution of the given PDDL plan (each action consumes one day; days are Day 0..Day 10 corresponding to d0..d10):

9) fly-to-krakow frankfurt → krakow (d8 -> d9, k0 -> k1)
   - Time: Day 8 → Day 9 (1 day)
   - Action: Take a direct flight from Frankfurt to Krakow.
   - Result: You arrive in Krakow on Day 9. Krakow visit counter advances from k0 to k1 (first Krakow day recorded).

10) hold-wedding-day9 (no day transition)
    - Time: Day 9 (occurs on Day 9)
    - Action: Hold the wedding in Krakow on Day 9.
    - Result: Wedding is held (wedding-held becomes true). This satisfies the requirement that the wedding occurs between Day 9 and Day 10.

11) stay-in-krakow (d9 -> d10, k1 -> k2)
    - Time: Day 9 → Day 10 (1 day)
    - Action: Stay one more day in Krakow (remain in Krakow through the end of the trip).
    - Result: You are in Krakow on Day 10. Krakow visit counter advances from k1 to k2 (total Krakow count reaches k2, representing two Krakow days).

Final status (after Step 11)
- Current day: Day 10 (d10) — trip length = 10 days (Day 0 through Day 10 as modeled).
- Cities visited: Frankfurt, Krakow, Dubrovnik (all marked visited).
- Wedding: Held in Krakow on Day 9 (requirement satisfied).
- Krakow preference: Two Krakow days achieved (k0 → k1 → k2).
- All travel used direct flights only (Dubrovnik↔Frankfurt and Frankfurt↔Krakow), consistent with public flight availability.

This sequence exactly follows the provided PDDL plan and meets the global constraints: total trip reaches Day 10, the wedding is held on Day 9, all three cities are visited, and only direct flights are used.
