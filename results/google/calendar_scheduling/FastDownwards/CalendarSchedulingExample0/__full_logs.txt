PROBLEM
------------------------------
You are an expert at scheduling meetings. You are given a few constraints on the existing schedule of each participant, the meeting duration, and possibly some preferences on the meeting time. Note there exists a solution that works with existing schedule of every participant. Here are a few example tasks and solutions:

TASK: You need to schedule a meeting for Michelle, Steven and Jerry for one hour between the work hours of 9:00 to 17:00 on Monday. 

Here are the existing schedules for everyone during the day: 
Michelle has meetings on Monday during 11:00 to 12:00; 
Steven has blocked their calendar on Monday during 9:00 to 9:30, 11:30 to 12:00, 13:30 to 14:00, 15:30 to 16:00; 
Jerry has blocked their calendar on Monday during 9:00 to 9:30, 10:00 to 11:00, 11:30 to 12:30, 13:00 to 14:30, 15:30 to 16:00, 16:30 to 17:00; 

Find a time that works for everyone's schedule and constraints.

NATURAL-PLAN sas_plan_3
------------------------------
Step 1 — schedule jerry jerry jerry t1430 t1500
- Action executed (as in the plan): schedule(jerry, jerry, jerry, t1430, t1500)
- Natural-language meaning: The orchestrator schedules a one-hour meeting starting at 14:30 (t1430).
- Time coverage: occupies two consecutive 30-minute slots — 14:30–15:00 (t1430) and 15:00–15:30 (t1500) — total meeting duration = 60 minutes.
- Participants (as given in the plan parameters): Jerry (appearing for all three participant parameters).
- Effect: meeting-scheduled at 14:30 is achieved (goal satisfied).
