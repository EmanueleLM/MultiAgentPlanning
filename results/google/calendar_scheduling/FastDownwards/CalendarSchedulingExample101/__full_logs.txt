PROBLEM
------------------------------
You are an expert at scheduling meetings. You are given a few constraints on the existing schedule of each participant, the meeting duration, and possibly some preferences on the meeting time. Note there exists a solution that works with existing schedule of every participant. Here are a few example tasks and solutions:

TASK: You need to schedule a meeting for Diana, Ethan and Janet for half an hour between the work hours of 9:00 to 17:00 on Monday. 

Here are the existing schedules for everyone during the day: 
Diana has blocked their calendar on Monday during 11:30 to 12:00, 13:00 to 13:30; 
Ethanhas no meetings the whole day.
Janet is busy on Monday during 9:00 to 10:00, 12:30 to 13:00, 14:00 to 15:00, 15:30 to 17:00; 

Janet do not want to meet on Monday after 12:00. Find a time that works for everyone's schedule and constraints.

NATURAL-PLAN sas_plan_7
------------------------------
1) schedule-at-s5 — Schedule the 60-minute meeting on Monday from 11:00 to 12:00 (this corresponds to slots s5 and s6).  
   - Attendees: denise, joseph, henry, christian  
   - Duration: 60 minutes (11:00–12:00) — within work hours 09:00–17:00  
   - Notes: all four participants are free during s5/s6 per the provided availabilities, so the meeting is successfully scheduled.  
   - Plan cost reported by the planner: 5

Goal achieved: meeting-scheduled (meeting-at s5).
================================================================================


PROBLEM
------------------------------
You are an expert at scheduling meetings. You are given a few constraints on the existing schedule of each participant, the meeting duration, and possibly some preferences on the meeting time. Note there exists a solution that works with existing schedule of every participant. Here are a few example tasks and solutions:

TASK: You need to schedule a meeting for Alexander, Elizabeth and Walter for half an hour between the work hours of 9:00 to 17:00 on Monday. 

Here are the existing schedules for everyone during the day: 
Alexander is busy on Monday during 9:30 to 10:00, 10:30 to 11:00, 12:30 to 13:00, 14:30 to 15:00, 16:00 to 17:00; 
Elizabeth is busy on Monday during 9:00 to 9:30, 11:30 to 12:30, 13:00 to 14:30; 
Walter is busy on Monday during 9:00 to 14:30, 15:30 to 17:00; 

Find a time that works for everyone's schedule and constraints.

NATURAL-PLAN sas_plan_2
------------------------------
Step 1 — schedule t6
- Action: Schedule the meeting for all participants (Madison, Linda, Logan, Virginia).
- Day: Monday
- Start time: 12:00
- Duration: 30 minutes (12:00–12:30)
- Rationale: At 12:00 (time slot t6) all four participants are available, so scheduling now satisfies the goal (meeting_scheduled).

Result: A 30-minute meeting is scheduled on Monday from 12:00 to 12:30 for Madison, Linda, Logan, and Virginia.
