Step 1 — schedule-meeting (s_09_00, s_09_30):
- PDDL action applied: (schedule-meeting s_09_00 s_09_30 anna anna anna anna)
- Interpreted human-readable action: Schedule a 60-minute meeting on Monday starting at 09:00 and ending at 10:00.
  - Occupied 30-min slots: s_09_00 (09:00–09:30) and s_09_30 (09:30–10:00).
  - Participants (as required by the problem): Dylan, Kathryn, Hannah, and Anna.
- Effect: meeting is scheduled and those two slots are marked occupied.
- Plan cost: 1 (unit cost)

No further steps. The meeting from 09:00–10:00 satisfies the one-hour meeting requirement within the 09:00–17:00 window.
