Step 1 — Schedule meeting (one action from the plan)
- Action: schedule-meeting at t0
- Time: Monday 09:00 — 09:30 (t0 is the 09:00 30-minute start slot)
- Participants: Marie, Janice, Elijah, Theresa
- Result: A 30-minute meeting is scheduled at 09:00–09:30 on Monday. This respects Theresa’s preference (no meetings after 12:00) and fits all participants’ availabilities as encoded in the problem.
