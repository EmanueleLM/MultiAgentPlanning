The following actions are taken to find a mutually available 30-minute time slot for Gerald, Roy, and Barbara, consistent with the provided PDDL plan:

1. **Schedule Meeting (Non-Preferred Slot):** Schedule the 30-minute meeting in the time slot **10:00 to 10:30**. This slot (T2) is mutually available to Gerald, Roy, and Barbara, but violates Gerald's preference to avoid meetings before 13:00.
