Based on the planning artifacts, the following sequence of actions is required to schedule the 30-minute meeting on Monday between 9:00 and 17:00 for Brandon, Jerry, and Bradley.

The PDDL plan identifies Time Slot T12, which corresponds to the time window starting at 15:00, as the optimal solution (cost 0, preferred slot).

1.  **Schedule the Meeting:** Schedule the 30-minute meeting for Brandon, Jerry, and Bradley starting at **15:00** on Monday. (This time slot, 15:00 to 15:30, satisfies all availability constraints and aligns with Brandon's preference to avoid meetings before 14:30.)
