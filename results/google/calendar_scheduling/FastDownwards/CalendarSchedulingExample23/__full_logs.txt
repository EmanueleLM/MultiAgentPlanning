PROBLEM
------------------------------
You are an expert at scheduling meetings. You are given a few constraints on the existing schedule of each participant, the meeting duration, and possibly some preferences on the meeting time. Note there exists a solution that works with existing schedule of every participant. Here are a few example tasks and solutions:

TASK: You need to schedule a meeting for Theresa, Charles and Betty for one hour between the work hours of 9:00 to 17:00 on Monday. 

Here are the existing schedules for everyone during the day: 
Theresa has meetings on Monday during 9:00 to 9:30, 12:30 to 13:30, 14:00 to 15:00, 16:30 to 17:00; 
Charles is busy on Monday during 10:00 to 10:30, 11:30 to 12:30, 14:00 to 15:30; 
Betty has meetings on Monday during 9:00 to 10:30, 12:00 to 12:30, 13:00 to 14:00, 15:00 to 16:00; 

Find a time that works for everyone's schedule and constraints.

You are given a few constraints on the existing schedule of each participant, the meeting duration, and possibly some preferences on the meeting time. Note there exists a solution that works with existing schedule of every participant. Here are a few example tasks and solutions:\n\nTASK: You need to schedule a meeting for Theresa, Charles and Betty for one hour between the work hours of 9:00 to 17:00 on Monday. \n\nHere are the existing schedules for everyone during the day: \nTheresa has meetings on Monday during 9:00 to 9:30, 12:30 to 13:30, 14:00 to 15:00, 16:30 to 17:00; \nCharles is busy on Monday during 10:00 to 10:30, 11:30 to 12:30, 14:00 to 15:30; \nBetty has meetings on Monday during 9:00 to 10:30, 12:00 to 12:30, 13:00 to 14:00, 15:00 to 16:00; \n\nFind a time that works for everyone's schedule and constraints. \nSOLUTION: ",

NATURAL-PLAN sas_plan_4
------------------------------
The following sequence of actions, executed by the Orchestrator, determines the earliest 1-hour common time slot for the participants (Theresa, Charles, and Betty) based on their constraints.

**Action 1: Schedule Meeting**
*   **Action:** Determine the earliest 1-hour time slot available for all participants.
*   **PDDL Translation:** `(schedule-meeting p630)`
*   **Time Slot:** Start time P630 corresponds to 10:30.
*   **Result:** Schedule the 1-hour meeting to start at **10:30** and end at **11:30** on Monday.
*   **Final Schedule:** Monday, 10:30–11:30.

PROBLEM
------------------------------
You are an expert at scheduling meetings. You are given a few constraints on the existing schedule of each participant, the meeting duration, and possibly some preferences on the meeting time. Note there exists a solution that works with existing schedule of every participant. Here are a few example tasks and solutions:

TASK: You need to schedule a meeting for Billy, Maria and William for one hour between the work hours of 9:00 to 17:00 on Monday. 

Here are the existing schedules for everyone during the day: 
Billy is busy on Monday during 11:30 to 12:00, 13:00 to 15:00, 16:00 to 16:30; 
Maria has blocked their calendar on Monday during 9:00 to 9:30, 10:00 to 10:30, 13:00 to 13:30, 14:00 to 14:30; 
William has meetings on Monday during 9:30 to 10:00, 12:00 to 12:30, 13:30 to 15:00, 15:30 to 17:00; 

Find a time that works for everyone's schedule and constraints.

NATURAL-PLAN sas_plan_1
------------------------------
Based on the PDDL plan and the scheduling constraints defined in the specification, the following sequence of actions is executed by the Orchestrator agent to achieve the goal of scheduling a 1-hour meeting.

| Step | Agent | PDDL Action | Natural Language Instruction |
| :--- | :---- | :---------- | :--------------------------- |
| 1 | Orchestrator | `(schedule_meeting t4)` | Schedule the required 1-hour meeting for Billy, Maria, and William on Monday. The selected conflict-free time slot is **10:30** (Start) to **11:30** (End). |
