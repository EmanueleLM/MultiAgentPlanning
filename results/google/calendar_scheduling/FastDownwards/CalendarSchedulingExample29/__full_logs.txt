PROBLEM
------------------------------
You are an expert at scheduling meetings. You are given a few constraints on the existing schedule of each participant, the meeting duration, and possibly some preferences on the meeting time. Note there exists a solution that works with existing schedule of every participant. Here are a few example tasks and solutions:

TASK: You need to schedule a meeting for Diana, Ethan and Janet for half an hour between the work hours of 9:00 to 17:00 on Monday. 

Here are the existing schedules for everyone during the day: 
Diana has blocked their calendar on Monday during 11:30 to 12:00, 13:00 to 13:30; 
Ethanhas no meetings the whole day.
Janet is busy on Monday during 9:00 to 10:00, 12:30 to 13:00, 14:00 to 15:00, 15:30 to 17:00; 

Janet do not want to meet on Monday after 12:00. Find a time that works for everyone's schedule and constraints.

NATURAL-PLAN sas_plan_0
------------------------------
1) Action: schedule-meeting-at s1100
   - Schedule a 60-minute meeting on Monday starting at 11:00 and ending at 12:00 (slot s1100).
   - Participants: Denise, Joseph, Henry, Christian.
   - Result: meeting-scheduled at 11:00–12:00 for all participants.
   - Plan cost: 1 (unit cost).
================================================================================


PROBLEM
------------------------------
You are an expert at scheduling meetings. You are given a few constraints on the existing schedule of each participant, the meeting duration, and possibly some preferences on the meeting time. Note there exists a solution that works with existing schedule of every participant. Here are a few example tasks and solutions:

TASK: You need to schedule a meeting for Alexander, Elizabeth and Walter for half an hour between the work hours of 9:00 to 17:00 on Monday. 

Here are the existing schedules for everyone during the day: 
Alexander is busy on Monday during 9:30 to 10:00, 10:30 to 11:00, 12:30 to 13:00, 14:30 to 15:00, 16:00 to 17:00; 
Elizabeth is busy on Monday during 9:00 to 9:30, 11:30 to 12:30, 13:00 to 14:30; 
Walter is busy on Monday during 9:00 to 14:30, 15:30 to 17:00; 

Find a time that works for everyone's schedule and constraints.

NATURAL-PLAN sas_plan_2
------------------------------
Step 1 — Schedule meeting at s1200 (Monday 12:00–12:30)
- Action performed: schedule s1200
- Meeting time: Monday, 12:00 — 12:30 (30 minutes)
- Participants: Madison, Linda, Logan, Virginia
- Effects:
  - The meeting is marked as scheduled.
  - The time slot s1200 (12:00) is booked.
  - Madison, Linda, Logan, and Virginia are no longer available at that slot.

Goal achieved: a 30-minute meeting for all participants is scheduled on Monday (12:00–12:30).
================================================================================


PROBLEM
------------------------------
You are an expert at scheduling meetings. You are given a few constraints on the existing schedule of each participant, the meeting duration, and possibly some preferences on the meeting time. Note there exists a solution that works with existing schedule of every participant. Here are a few example tasks and solutions:

TASK: You need to schedule a meeting for David, Debra and Kevin for one hour between the work hours of 9:00 to 17:00 on Monday. 

Here are the existing schedules for everyone during the day: 
Davidhas no meetings the whole day.
Debra has meetings on Monday during 9:30 to 10:00, 11:00 to 11:30, 12:00 to 13:00, 14:00 to 14:30, 16:00 to 16:30; 
Kevin has blocked their calendar on Monday during 9:00 to 12:00, 14:00 to 17:00; 

Find a time that works for everyone's schedule and constraints.

SOLUTION: 
================================================================================


FINAL-PLAN
------------------------------
I can generate the PDDL domain and problem, but I don't yet have the participants' busy intervals you mentioned. I must not invent availability, so I need those machine-readable busy intervals before I can produce a valid problem file. Please provide each participant's busy intervals for Monday (in the Monday 09:00–17:00 window). Also indicate whether you want 30-minute or 15-minute discretization (I will choose 30-minute by default unless any interval uses 15-minute boundaries).

Please supply the intervals in one of these formats (pick one consistent format):

- JSON-like:
  {
    "Dylan": [["09:00","10:30"], ["13:15","14:00"]],
    "Kathryn": [["09:30","10:00"], ["12:00","13:00"]],
    "Hannah": [["11:00","12:30"]],
    "Anna": [["09:00","09:30"], ["15:00","16:00"]]
  }

- Plain list:
  Dylan: 09:00-10:30, 13:15-14:00
  Kathryn: 09:30-10:00, 12:00-13:00
  Hannah: 11:00-12:30
  Anna: 09:00-09:30, 15:00-16:00

Notes / constraints I will follow:
- Meeting must be exactly 60 minutes (contiguous slots totaling 60 minutes).
- Meeting must start between 09:00 and 16:00 inclusive if using 60-min requirement (end by 17:00).
- Busy intervals you provide are hard constraints (participants unavailable during those intervals).
- Preferences expressed as “avoid / would rather / earliest” will be treated as strict constraints (i.e., enforce earliest possible start as a hard rule only if you explicitly state it—otherwise I will produce all feasible earliest start choices; if you want me to force the earliest feasible start, state that).
- I will preserve participant identities distinctly in the PDDL.

If you want, I can also:
- Provide the PDDL domain now (generic) and a blank problem template for you to fill; or
- Wait and produce both domain + fully-specified problem after you supply the busy intervals.

Which do you prefer? If you want the domain now, I can emit a ready domain (works with Fast Downward) and then, once you give intervals, fill in the problem.

NATURAL-PLAN sas_plan_1
------------------------------
Plan steps (human-readable):

1) Schedule the meeting starting at 11:00 on Monday.
   - PDDL action: (schedule t1100 t1130)
   - Meeting time span: 11:00–12:00 (uses the 11:00–11:30 slot and the 11:30–12:00 slot)
   - Duration: 60 minutes
   - Participants: Dylan, Kathryn, Hannah, Anna
   - Result: Meeting is scheduled with start time 11:00 (meeting occupies 11:00–12:00)
================================================================================


PROBLEM
------------------------------
You are an expert at scheduling meetings. You are given a few constraints on the existing schedule of each participant, the meeting duration, and possibly some preferences on the meeting time. Note there exists a solution that works with existing schedule of every participant. Here are a few example tasks and solutions:

TASK: You need to schedule a meeting for Gerald, Roy and Barbara for half an hour between the work hours of 9:00 to 17:00 on Monday. 

Here are the existing schedules for everyone during the day: 
Gerald is busy on Monday during 9:00 to 9:30, 13:00 to 14:00, 15:00 to 15:30, 16:00 to 17:00; 
Roy is free the entire day.
Barbara has blocked their calendar on Monday during 9:30 to 10:00, 11:30 to 14:00, 14:30 to 15:00, 15:30 to 17:00; 

Gerald would like to avoid more meetings on Monday before 13:00. Find a time that works for everyone's schedule and constraints.

NATURAL-PLAN sas_plan_0
------------------------------
1) schedule s1630 — Orchestrator schedules the 30-minute meeting on Monday from 16:30 to 17:00 (slot s1630) for Diane, Jack, Eugene, and Patricia. This action books the 16:30–17:00 slot and achieves the goal (meeting scheduled).
================================================================================


PROBLEM
------------------------------
You are an expert at scheduling meetings. You are given a few constraints on the existing schedule of each participant, the meeting duration, and possibly some preferences on the meeting time. Note there exists a solution that works with existing schedule of every participant. Here are a few example tasks and solutions:

TASK: You need to schedule a meeting for Brandon, Jerry and Bradley for half an hour between the work hours of 9:00 to 17:00 on Monday. 

Here are the existing schedules for everyone during the day: 
Brandon has meetings on Monday during 13:00 to 14:00, 15:30 to 16:00, 16:30 to 17:00; 
Jerryhas no meetings the whole day.
Bradley has meetings on Monday during 9:00 to 11:30, 12:00 to 15:00, 16:00 to 16:30; 

Brandon would like to avoid more meetings on Monday before 14:30. Find a time that works for everyone's schedule and constraints.

PROBLEM
------------------------------
You are an expert at scheduling meetings. You are given a few constraints on the existing schedule of each participant, the meeting duration, and possibly some preferences on the meeting time. Note there exists a solution that works with existing schedule of every participant. Here are a few example tasks and solutions:

TASK: You need to schedule a meeting for Joyce, Christine and Alexander for half an hour between the work hours of 9:00 to 17:00 on Monday. 

Here are the existing schedules for everyone during the day: 
Joyce has meetings on Monday during 11:00 to 11:30, 13:30 to 14:00, 14:30 to 16:30; 
Christinehas no meetings the whole day.
Alexander has meetings on Monday during 9:00 to 11:00, 12:00 to 12:30, 13:30 to 15:00, 15:30 to 16:00, 16:30 to 17:00; 

Christine can not meet on Monday before 12:00. Find a time that works for everyone's schedule and constraints.

Christine can not meet on Monday before 12:00. Find a time that works for everyone's schedule and constraints. 
SOLUTION: 
================================================================================


FINAL-PLAN
------------------------------
I don't yet have the participants' Monday availability. Please supply each participant's availability in 30-minute slots between 09:00 and 17:00 (slots are 09:00-09:30, 09:30-10:00, …, 16:30-17:00). I will pick the earliest single 30-minute slot that is available to everyone and then produce the PDDL domain and problem (wrapped in the required tags) for FastDownward.

Please provide:
- Participant name (role if relevant)
- A list of available slots for Monday in HH:MM-HH:MM format

Example:
- Alice (facilitator): 09:00-09:30, 09:30-10:00, 10:00-10:30, 14:00-14:30
- Bob (engineer): 09:30-10:00, 10:00-10:30, 11:00-11:30
- Carol (designer): 09:00-09:30, 09:30-10:00, 14:00-14:30

If you have any hard constraints beyond availability (e.g., person X must not be scheduled before 10:00), state them now.

NATURAL-PLAN sas_plan_2
------------------------------
Step 1 — schedule-meeting (orchestrator1 s1600 frances jason rachel william)
- Action: The orchestrator (orchestrator1) schedules a meeting.
- Participants: Frances, Jason, Rachel, William (in that order as in the plan).
- Time: Monday 16:00–16:30 (slot s1600).
- Duration: 30 minutes.
- Preconditions satisfied: all four participants are available at 16:00–16:30.
- Result: Meeting scheduled for 16:00–16:30 (goal meeting-scheduled s1600 achieved).
================================================================================


PROBLEM
------------------------------
You are an expert at scheduling meetings. You are given a few constraints on the existing schedule of each participant, the meeting duration, and possibly some preferences on the meeting time. Note there exists a solution that works with existing schedule of every participant. Here are a few example tasks and solutions:

TASK: You need to schedule a meeting for Scott, Gabriel and Christine for half an hour between the work hours of 9:00 to 17:00 on Monday. 

Here are the existing schedules for everyone during the day: 
Scott is busy on Monday during 9:30 to 10:30, 13:30 to 14:00, 14:30 to 15:00, 15:30 to 16:00, 16:30 to 17:00; 
Gabrielhas no meetings the whole day.
Christine is busy on Monday during 9:00 to 10:00, 10:30 to 12:30, 13:00 to 17:00; 

Find a time that works for everyone's schedule and constraints.

Find a time that works for everyone's schedule and constraints. 
SOLUTION: 
================================================================================


FINAL-PLAN
------------------------------
I don't yet have the participants' busy intervals or the work-hours to encode. Please provide the following so I can generate the PDDL domain and problem:

1) Work hours for Monday (start and end), e.g. "09:00-17:00".  
2) Meeting duration (you said one hour — confirm or change).  
3) Time-slot granularity (choose one): 60 min, 30 min, or 15 min. (Default suggestion: 30 min to allow half-hour starts.)  
4) For each participant, a list of busy intervals on Monday (each inside the work hours), in this format:
   - ParticipantName: HH:MM-HH:MM, HH:MM-HH:MM, ...
   Example:
   - Alice: 09:00-10:30, 12:00-13:00
   - Bob: 11:30-12:30
5) Confirm that natural-language preferences should be treated as strict hard constraints (I will enforce them as hard unavailability).

Once you provide that, I will produce:
- A PDDL domain (between <domain></domain>) modeling discrete time slots and an action for scheduling a one-hour meeting (distinct actions per participant if needed).
- A PDDL problem (between <problem></problem>) encoding the earliest feasible contiguous one-hour slot when all participants are free, with busy intervals encoded as forbidden slots.

NATURAL-PLAN sas_plan_2
------------------------------
Step 1 — Schedule the meeting at 10:00 on Monday (schedule-at t1000):
- Meeting start: 10:00
- Duration: 60 minutes (10:00–11:00)
- Participants: Olivia, Anna, Virginia, Paul
- Result: The one-hour meeting is scheduled and the scheduling goal is achieved.
================================================================================


PROBLEM
------------------------------
You are an expert at scheduling meetings. You are given a few constraints on the existing schedule of each participant, the meeting duration, and possibly some preferences on the meeting time. Note there exists a solution that works with existing schedule of every participant. Here are a few example tasks and solutions:

TASK: You need to schedule a meeting for Margaret, Donna and Helen for half an hour between the work hours of 9:00 to 17:00 on Monday. 

Here are the existing schedules for everyone during the day: 
Margaret has blocked their calendar on Monday during 9:00 to 10:00, 10:30 to 11:00, 11:30 to 12:00, 13:00 to 13:30, 15:00 to 15:30; 
Donna has blocked their calendar on Monday during 14:30 to 15:00, 16:00 to 16:30; 
Helen has meetings on Monday during 9:00 to 9:30, 10:00 to 11:30, 13:00 to 14:00, 14:30 to 15:00, 15:30 to 17:00; 

Helen do not want to meet on Monday after 13:30. Find a time that works for everyone's schedule and constraints.

NATURAL-PLAN sas_plan_0
------------------------------
1) Schedule the 30-minute meeting for all participants (peter, judith, keith, evelyn) on Monday from 16:00 to 16:30 (slot15). 
   - Duration: 30 minutes (16:00–16:30).
   - Effect: the meeting is now scheduled at that slot and no further scheduling is required.
================================================================================


PROBLEM
------------------------------
You are an expert at scheduling meetings. You are given a few constraints on the existing schedule of each participant, the meeting duration, and possibly some preferences on the meeting time. Note there exists a solution that works with existing schedule of every participant. Here are a few example tasks and solutions:

TASK: You need to schedule a meeting for Brian, Billy and Patricia for half an hour between the work hours of 9:00 to 17:00 on Monday. 

Here are the existing schedules for everyone during the day: 
Brianhas no meetings the whole day.
Billy is busy on Monday during 10:00 to 10:30, 11:30 to 12:00, 14:00 to 14:30, 16:30 to 17:00; 
Patricia has blocked their calendar on Monday during 9:00 to 12:30, 13:30 to 14:00, 14:30 to 16:00, 16:30 to 17:00; 

Billy would like to avoid more meetings on Monday after 15:30. Find a time that works for everyone's schedule and constraints.

SOLUTION: 
================================================================================


FINAL-PLAN
------------------------------
I don't yet have the participants' availability reports (avail_lisa, avail_dorothy, avail_anthony, avail_ryan). I can't invent or assume availability — I need the actual availability intervals to compute the intersection and produce the problem file. Please provide each participant's Monday availability within working hours 09:00–17:00, as strict constraints (intervals when they are available). Use this format for each participant (examples):

- avail_lisa: [09:00-10:30, 13:00-15:00]
- avail_dorothy: [09:30-11:00, 14:00-17:00]
- avail_anthony: [09:00-09:30, 10:00-12:00, 13:00-17:00]
- avail_ryan: [09:00-12:00, 13:30-16:00]

Guidelines:
- Use 24-hour times, minute precision, and list only intervals fully within Monday 09:00–17:00.
- I will treat these as hard constraints (unavailable times cannot be used).
- I will discretize time into 30-minute slots: 09:00-09:30 (s1), 09:30-10:00 (s2), …, 16:30-17:00 (s16).
- I will compute which slots are common-available (every participant is available during that 30-minute slot) and then pick the earliest common-available slot (as a hard requirement).
- Once you provide the four availability reports, I will produce:
  - A PDDL domain (suitable for FastDownward) enclosed in <domain>...</domain>.
  - A PDDL problem (with participants distinct, slots enumerated, common-available facts computed, and the earliest valid 30-minute slot selected) enclosed in <problem>...</problem>.

To help, here's a ready domain skeleton (suitable for FastDownward) that I will use to build the problem once I have availabilities:

<domain>
(define (domain meeting-scheduling)
  (:requirements :strips :typing :negative-preconditions)
  (:types participant slot)
  (:predicates
    (participant ?p - participant)
    (slot ?s - slot)
    (common-available ?s - slot)
    (meeting-scheduled)
    (scheduled ?s - slot)
    (attends ?p - participant ?s - slot)
  )

  ;; Schedule the meeting at a single 30-minute slot.
  ;; Parameters include the four participants so that the action effects can record
  ;; that each distinct participant attends the chosen slot.
  (:action schedule
    :parameters (?s - slot ?lisa - participant ?dorothy - participant ?anthony - participant ?ryan - participant)
    :precondition (and
      (slot ?s)
      (common-available ?s)
      (not (meeting-scheduled))
    )
    :effect (and
      (meeting-scheduled)
      (scheduled ?s)
      (attends ?lisa ?s)
      (attends ?dorothy ?s)
      (attends ?anthony ?s)
      (attends ?ryan ?s)
    )
  )
)
</domain>

Provide the four availability reports now (in the format above) and I will compute the earliest common 30-minute slot and return the complete PDDL domain and problem (enclosed in <domain>...</domain> and <problem>...</problem>).

NATURAL-PLAN sas_plan_1
------------------------------
Planned actions (following the provided PDDL plan)

1) schedule-meeting at timeslot_1630 (Monday 16:30–17:00), attendees: anthony, dorothy, lisa, ryan.
   - Action performed: reserve the 16:30 timeslot for the meeting (meeting scheduled).
   - Attendees marked as attending: anthony, dorothy, lisa, ryan.
   - Meeting duration: 30 minutes (16:30–17:00), within working hours (09:00–17:00).
   - Outcome: The required 30-minute meeting is scheduled at 16:30 and all participants are set to attend, satisfying the goal.
================================================================================


PROBLEM
------------------------------
You are an expert at scheduling meetings. You are given a few constraints on the existing schedule of each participant, the meeting duration, and possibly some preferences on the meeting time. Note there exists a solution that works with existing schedule of every participant. Here are a few example tasks and solutions:

TASK: You need to schedule a meeting for Stephen, Edward and Angela for one hour between the work hours of 9:00 to 17:00 on Monday. 

Here are the existing schedules for everyone during the day: 
Stephen is busy on Monday during 10:00 to 10:30, 13:00 to 13:30, 14:30 to 15:00, 16:00 to 16:30; 
Edward has blocked their calendar on Monday during 9:00 to 9:30, 10:00 to 10:30, 13:30 to 14:30, 15:00 to 16:00; 
Angela is busy on Monday during 9:00 to 11:30, 12:30 to 13:00, 13:30 to 15:30, 16:00 to 17:00; 

Find a time that works for everyone's schedule and constraints.

NATURAL-PLAN sas_plan_3
------------------------------
Step 1 — schedule-slot1
- Action (planner): schedule-slot1
- Human-readable: Schedule the 30‑minute meeting on Monday from 09:00 to 09:30 (slot1).
- Participants: Marie, Janice, Elijah, Theresa
- Duration / timestamp: 09:00–09:30 on Monday (30 minutes)
- Note: This slot satisfies all participants' availabilities and Theresa's preference (no meetings after 12:00).
- Plan cost reported by planner: 1

Result: Goal achieved — meeting scheduled.
================================================================================


PROBLEM
------------------------------
You are an expert at scheduling meetings. You are given a few constraints on the existing schedule of each participant, the meeting duration, and possibly some preferences on the meeting time. Note there exists a solution that works with existing schedule of every participant. Here are a few example tasks and solutions:

TASK: You need to schedule a meeting for Ralph, Peter and Daniel for half an hour between the work hours of 9:00 to 17:00 on Monday. 

Here are the existing schedules for everyone during the day: 
Ralph has meetings on Monday during 13:30 to 14:00, 14:30 to 15:00; 
Peter is busy on Monday during 9:00 to 9:30, 11:00 to 13:00, 16:00 to 16:30; 
Daniel has blocked their calendar on Monday during 9:00 to 10:00, 10:30 to 15:30, 16:00 to 17:00; 

Daniel would like to avoid more meetings on Monday after 13:30. Find a time that works for everyone's schedule and constraints.

PROBLEM
------------------------------
You are an expert at scheduling meetings. You are given a few constraints on the existing schedule of each participant, the meeting duration, and possibly some preferences on the meeting time. Note there exists a solution that works with existing schedule of every participant. Here are a few example tasks and solutions:

TASK: You need to schedule a meeting for Bobby, Scott and Kimberly for one hour between the work hours of 9:00 to 17:00 on Monday. 

Here are the existing schedules for everyone during the day: 
Bobby's calendar is wide open the entire day.
Scott is busy on Monday during 11:30 to 12:00, 15:30 to 16:00; 
Kimberly is busy on Monday during 11:00 to 12:00, 12:30 to 13:00, 13:30 to 14:00, 14:30 to 15:00, 15:30 to 17:00; 

Find a time that works for everyone's schedule and constraints.

PROBLEM
------------------------------
You are an expert at scheduling meetings. You are given a few constraints on the existing schedule of each participant, the meeting duration, and possibly some preferences on the meeting time. Note there exists a solution that works with existing schedule of every participant. Here are a few example tasks and solutions:

TASK: You need to schedule a meeting for Theresa, Charles and Betty for one hour between the work hours of 9:00 to 17:00 on Monday. 

Here are the existing schedules for everyone during the day: 
Theresa has meetings on Monday during 9:00 to 9:30, 12:30 to 13:30, 14:00 to 15:00, 16:30 to 17:00; 
Charles is busy on Monday during 10:00 to 10:30, 11:30 to 12:30, 14:00 to 15:30; 
Betty has meetings on Monday during 9:00 to 10:30, 12:00 to 12:30, 13:00 to 14:00, 15:00 to 16:00; 

Find a time that works for everyone's schedule and constraints.

PROBLEM
------------------------------
You are an expert at scheduling meetings. You are given a few constraints on the existing schedule of each participant, the meeting duration, and possibly some preferences on the meeting time. Note there exists a solution that works with existing schedule of every participant. Here are a few example tasks and solutions:

TASK: You need to schedule a meeting for Benjamin, Hannah and Brenda for half an hour between the work hours of 9:00 to 17:00 on Monday. 

Here are the existing schedules for everyone during the day: 
Benjamin is free the entire day.
Hannah is free the entire day.
Brenda has meetings on Monday during 9:30 to 10:00, 11:30 to 12:30, 14:00 to 16:30; 

Benjamin do not want to meet on Monday after 9:30. Find a time that works for everyone's schedule and constraints.

    ;; Replace/add participant objects here (example below). Do NOT invent availability;
    ;; provide availability (free facts) in the :init section below according to your inputs.
    ;; Example participants (remove or replace with actual participants you provide):
    ;; alice bob carol - participant
  )

  ;; INIT: put participant object declarations and free facts here based on the availability you provide.
  ;; The assistant will convert your natural-language availability into (free <participant> <slot>) facts.
  ;; EXAMPLE (commented out) showing format:

  ;; ;(participant bob)
  ;; ;(free alice s0900)
  ;; ;(free alice s0930)
  ;; ;(free bob   s0900)
  ;; ;(free bob   s0930)
  ;; The actual problem below must be generated from the availability you supply.
  (:init
    ;; Placeholder: no participants or free facts are included yet.
    ;; Provide participant availability and the assistant will generate a concrete problem
    ;; where the goal is the earliest slot that satisfies every agent's availability constraint.
  )

  ;; GOAL: will be set to the chosen slot and attendance for every participant,
  ;; once you supply participants and their availability. Example goal (to be generated):
  ;; (:goal (and (meeting-started s0900) (attends alice s0900) (attends bob s0900)))
  ;;
  ;; Currently left empty because participant availability has not been provided.
  (:goal (and))
)
</problem>

I cannot generate the final problem (with the chosen earliest feasible slot encoded as the goal) until you provide each participant's availability summary. Please supply, for each participant, the list of 30-minute slots they are free (or the list they are unavailable). Use one of these preferred formats:

1) Participant -> list of free slots
- alice: 09:00-09:30, 09:30-10:00, 11:00-11:30
- bob: 09:00-09:30, 10:30-11:00, ...

2) Participant -> list of unavailable slots
- alice unavailable: 13:00-13:30, 14:00-14:30
- bob unavailable: 09:30-10:00, ...

I will:
- Convert your natural-language availability into the concrete (participant ...) and (free ...) facts in :init.
- Prioritise the earliest slot between 09:00 and 17:00 (30-min discrete slots) that satisfies every participant's constraints (treating preferences as hard constraints).
- Produce a complete PDDL problem (enclosed in <problem>...</problem>) where the goal requires the meeting to be started at the chosen slot and each participant to have an attends fact for that slot.

PROBLEM
------------------------------
You are an expert at scheduling meetings. You are given a few constraints on the existing schedule of each participant, the meeting duration, and possibly some preferences on the meeting time. Note there exists a solution that works with existing schedule of every participant. Here are a few example tasks and solutions:

TASK: You need to schedule a meeting for Anthony, Pamela and Zachary for one hour between the work hours of 9:00 to 17:00 on Monday. 

Here are the existing schedules for everyone during the day: 
Anthony has meetings on Monday during 9:30 to 10:00, 12:00 to 13:00, 16:00 to 16:30; 
Pamela is busy on Monday during 9:30 to 10:00, 16:30 to 17:00; 
Zachary has meetings on Monday during 9:00 to 11:30, 12:00 to 12:30, 13:00 to 13:30, 14:30 to 15:00, 16:00 to 17:00; 

Pamela do not want to meet on Monday after 14:30. Find a time that works for everyone's schedule and constraints.

================================================================================


FINAL-PLAN
------------------------------
I don't yet have the participants' availability lists. Please provide machine-readable availability for each participant (avail_julia, avail_joshua, avail_nicholas, avail_david, avail_melissa). Once you give those, I'll produce a PDDL domain and PDDL problem (FastDownward compatible) that selects the earliest 30-minute start time between 09:00 and 17:00 when everyone is free.

Suggested input formats (pick one):

1) As 30-minute slot indices (recommended — unambiguous):
- Use slots 0..15 where:
  - 0 = 09:00–09:30
  - 1 = 09:30–10:00
  - ...
  - 15 = 16:30–17:00
Example:
avail_julia: [0,1,2,3,4,5]
avail_joshua: [2,3,4,5,6]
...

2) As time-range strings (I will convert to slots):
Example:
avail_julia: ["09:00-10:30","13:00-15:00"]
avail_joshua: ["10:00-12:00","13:30-17:00"]
(Allowed start times must be on 30-minute boundaries. I will convert these intervals into the corresponding slot indices.)

Notes:
- Treat any natural-language preferences as hard constraints (i.e., unavailable unless explicitly listed).
- If a participant has no availability at all on Monday, state avail_xxx: [].
- I will pick the earliest slot that is present in every participant's availability; if none exists, I will indicate infeasibility.

Please paste the five availability lists (in your chosen format) and I will return the <domain>...</domain> and <problem>...</problem> PDDL pair with a short comment indicating the chosen start time.

NATURAL-PLAN sas_plan_1
------------------------------
Plan (1 step)

1) Schedule a 30-minute meeting starting Monday at 11:30 (timeslot t11_30).
   - Start time: Monday 11:30
   - Duration: 30 minutes (11:30–12:00)
   - Participants: Julia, Joshua, Nicholas, David, Melissa
   - Effect: mark timeslot t11_30 as scheduled (meeting placed)
   - Rationale: all participants are available at 11:30 per their provided availabilities; this single action satisfies the goal (scheduled t11_30).
================================================================================


PROBLEM
------------------------------
You are an expert at scheduling meetings. You are given a few constraints on the existing schedule of each participant, the meeting duration, and possibly some preferences on the meeting time. Note there exists a solution that works with existing schedule of every participant. Here are a few example tasks and solutions:

TASK: You need to schedule a meeting for Katherine, Nicole and Kevin for one hour between the work hours of 9:00 to 17:00 on Monday. 

Here are the existing schedules for everyone during the day: 
Katherine is free the entire day.
Nicole's calendar is wide open the entire day.
Kevin has blocked their calendar on Monday during 9:00 to 10:00, 10:30 to 11:30, 12:00 to 15:30, 16:30 to 17:00; 

Find a time that works for everyone's schedule and constraints.

SOLUTION: 
================================================================================


FINAL-PLAN
------------------------------
I don't yet have the participants' structured availability summaries. I can't invent availability data, and the PDDL problem requires those exact availabilities (plus Margaret's preference) to produce a correct schedule.

Please provide the availability summaries for each participant in this exact structured format (one participant per block). Also specify the meeting day (e.g., 2025-10-15). Use local times and 24-hour clock. Example format and required fields below:

Required fields for each participant:
- name: (string)
- work-hours: [HH:MM, HH:MM]  ; daily allowable scheduling window
- availabilities: list of [HH:MM, HH:MM] intervals on the specified day (only these intervals are usable)
- resources/constraints (optional): any additional hard constraints (e.g., "requires-cam", "no-back-to-back-meetings") — if none, leave empty

Mark Margaret's preference explicitly and note that it must be treated as a strict constraint (e.g., "Margaret: prefers not before 10:00" will be encoded as "no meeting before 10:00").

Example participant block:
- name: Alice
- work-hours: [09:00, 17:00]
- availabilities: [[09:00, 10:30], [13:00, 16:00]]
- resources/constraints: []

- name: Margaret
- work-hours: [08:00, 16:00]
- availabilities: [[09:00, 10:00], [11:30, 15:30]]
- resources/constraints: ["no-meeting-before-11:00"]  ; (this will be encoded as a hard constraint)

Once you send the full set of participant blocks and the meeting day, I will:
1) produce a complete PDDL domain (multi-agent, resources per participant, 30-minute meeting duration, time discretized to minutes or 5- or 15-minute slots as you prefer) compatible with Fast Downward, and
2) produce a PDDL problem that encodes the participants as separate agents, their work hours and availabilities, and Margaret's preference as a strict constraint — and which schedules the earliest feasible 30-minute meeting.

Optional: tell me the desired time granularity for the model (minute-level or e.g., 5-minute slots). Default will be 5-minute granularity for tractability.

NATURAL-PLAN sas_plan_5
------------------------------
Step 1 — schedule-at t15_30
- Action: Schedule the 30-minute meeting on Monday starting at 15:30 (ends at 16:00).
- Participants: shirley, jacob, stephen, margaret, mason.
- Why valid: every participant is available at the 15:30 slot in the provided availabilities, and Margaret’s preference of not meeting before 14:30 is respected.
- Result: the meeting is scheduled at 15:30–16:00 on Monday (unscheduled → scheduled); the listed participants are no longer free at 15:30. Goal achieved.
================================================================================


PROBLEM
------------------------------
You are an expert at scheduling meetings. You are given a few constraints on the existing schedule of each participant, the meeting duration, and possibly some preferences on the meeting time. Note there exists a solution that works with existing schedule of every participant. Here are a few example tasks and solutions:

TASK: You need to schedule a meeting for Jesse, Kathryn and Megan for half an hour between the work hours of 9:00 to 17:00 on Monday. 

Here are the existing schedules for everyone during the day: 
Jesse has blocked their calendar on Monday during 10:00 to 10:30, 15:30 to 16:00; 
Kathryn's calendar is wide open the entire day.
Megan is busy on Monday during 10:30 to 11:00, 11:30 to 12:30, 13:30 to 14:30, 15:00 to 16:30; 

The group would like to meet at their earlist availability.
Find a time that works for everyone's schedule and constraints.

SOLUTION: 
================================================================================


FINAL-PLAN
------------------------------
I don't yet have the participants' availability arrays. Please provide avail_walter, avail_danielle, avail_julia, avail_samuel, and avail_lori.

Format requirements (choose one):

1) Binary arrays (preferred)
- 16 entries, one per 30-minute slot from 09:00–09:30 through 16:30–17:00.
- Use 1 = free, 0 = busy.
- Example:
  avail_walter = [1,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1]

OR

2) List of free slot labels
- Provide the exact slot strings from the set:
  "09:00-09:30","09:30-10:00","10:00-10:30","10:30-11:00","11:00-11:30","11:30-12:00","12:00-12:30","12:30-13:00","13:00-13:30","13:30-14:00","14:00-14:30","14:30-15:00","15:00-15:30","15:30-16:00","16:00-16:30","16:30-17:00"
- Example:
  avail_lori = ["09:00-09:30","09:30-10:00","11:00-11:30", ..., "16:30-17:00"]

Once you provide all five arrays, I'll produce the FastDownward-compatible PDDL domain and problem (two tagged blocks) that assert the earliest 30-minute slot on Monday when all five are free.

NATURAL-PLAN sas_plan_3
------------------------------
1) Action: schedule(slot8)
   - Effect: Schedule a 30-minute meeting on Monday from 12:30 to 13:00 (slot8 = 12:30–13:00).
   - Participants: Walter, Danielle, Julia, Samuel, Lori.
   - Outcome: meeting-scheduled (the meeting at 12:30–13:00 is confirmed for all participants).
================================================================================


PROBLEM
------------------------------
You are an expert at scheduling meetings. You are given a few constraints on the existing schedule of each participant, the meeting duration, and possibly some preferences on the meeting time. Note there exists a solution that works with existing schedule of every participant. Here are a few example tasks and solutions:

TASK: You need to schedule a meeting for Brittany, Emily and Doris for half an hour between the work hours of 9:00 to 17:00 on Monday. 

Here are the existing schedules for everyone during the day: 
Brittany has meetings on Monday during 13:00 to 13:30, 16:00 to 16:30; 
Emily is free the entire day.
Doris is busy on Monday during 9:00 to 11:00, 11:30 to 14:30, 15:00 to 17:00; 

You would like to schedule the meeting at their earlist availability.
Find a time that works for everyone's schedule and constraints.

NATURAL-PLAN sas_plan_1
------------------------------
Step 1 — schedule-meeting t16:
Schedule a 30‑minute meeting on Monday from 16:30 to 17:00 (timeslot t16) with all required attendees: Jesse, Nancy, Isabella, Harold, and Linda. This action marks the meeting as scheduled and records it at timeslot t16.
================================================================================


PROBLEM
------------------------------
You are an expert at scheduling meetings. You are given a few constraints on the existing schedule of each participant, the meeting duration, and possibly some preferences on the meeting time. Note there exists a solution that works with existing schedule of every participant. Here are a few example tasks and solutions:

TASK: You need to schedule a meeting for Madison, Diana and Shirley for one hour between the work hours of 9:00 to 17:00 on Monday. 

Here are the existing schedules for everyone during the day: 
Madison has blocked their calendar on Monday during 9:30 to 10:00, 11:30 to 12:00; 
Diana has meetings on Monday during 11:00 to 11:30, 13:00 to 13:30; 
Shirley is busy on Monday during 9:00 to 12:00, 13:30 to 15:00, 15:30 to 17:00; 

Find a time that works for everyone's schedule and constraints.

Here are a few example tasks and solutions:\n\nTASK: You need to schedule a meeting for Madison, Diana and Shirley for one hour between the work hours of 9:00 to 17:00 on Monday. \n\nHere are the existing schedules for everyone during the day: \nMadison has blocked their calendar on Monday during 9:30 to 10:00, 11:30 to 12:00; \nDiana has meetings on Monday during 11:00 to 11:30, 13:00 to 13:30; \nShirley is busy on Monday during 9:00 to 12:00, 13:30 to 15:00, 15:30 to 17:00; \n\nFind a time that works for everyone's schedule and constraints. \nSOLUTION: ",
