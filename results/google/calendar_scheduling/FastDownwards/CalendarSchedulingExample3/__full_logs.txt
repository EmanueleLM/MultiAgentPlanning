PROBLEM
------------------------------
You are an expert at scheduling meetings. You are given a few constraints on the existing schedule of each participant, the meeting duration, and possibly some preferences on the meeting time. Note there exists a solution that works with existing schedule of every participant. Here are a few example tasks and solutions:

TASK: You need to schedule a meeting for Michelle, Steven and Jerry for one hour between the work hours of 9:00 to 17:00 on Monday. 

Here are the existing schedules for everyone during the day: 
Michelle has meetings on Monday during 11:00 to 12:00; 
Steven has blocked their calendar on Monday during 9:00 to 9:30, 11:30 to 12:00, 13:30 to 14:00, 15:30 to 16:00; 
Jerry has blocked their calendar on Monday during 9:00 to 9:30, 10:00 to 11:00, 11:30 to 12:30, 13:00 to 14:30, 15:30 to 16:00, 16:30 to 17:00; 

Find a time that works for everyone's schedule and constraints.

NATURAL-PLAN sas_plan_1
------------------------------
Step 1 — Execute action from the plan:
- PDDL action: (schedule-meeting m1 t1430 t1500 jerry jerry jerry)
- Natural-language: Schedule meeting "m1" starting at 14:30 (slot t1430), occupying the consecutive slots t1430 and t1500. These two 30-minute slots together give a 60-minute meeting from 14:30 to 15:30.
- Participants in the action parameters (as written in the plan): Jerry, Jerry, Jerry (the plan uses Jerry for all three participant parameters).

Validation (compliance with the specification):
- The chosen start time is 14:30 and the meeting duration is 60 minutes (14:30–15:30), matching the environment constraints (work hours 09:00–17:00, 30-minute resolution, 60-minute meeting).
- According to the provided availabilities in the problem, Michelle, Steven and Jerry are all free at the required slots (t1430 and t1500), so this scheduled meeting time fits all participants.

Result: Meeting m1 is scheduled to start at 14:30 and run until 15:30 on Monday; the plan action that produced this is (schedule-meeting m1 t1430 t1500 jerry jerry jerry).

PROBLEM
------------------------------
You are an expert at scheduling meetings. You are given a few constraints on the existing schedule of each participant, the meeting duration, and possibly some preferences on the meeting time. Note there exists a solution that works with existing schedule of every participant. Here are a few example tasks and solutions:

TASK: You need to schedule a meeting for Raymond, Billy and Donald for half an hour between the work hours of 9:00 to 17:00 on Monday. 

Here are the existing schedules for everyone during the day: 
Raymond has blocked their calendar on Monday during 9:00 to 9:30, 11:30 to 12:00, 13:00 to 13:30, 15:00 to 15:30; 
Billy has meetings on Monday during 10:00 to 10:30, 12:00 to 13:00, 16:30 to 17:00; 
Donald has meetings on Monday during 9:00 to 9:30, 10:00 to 11:00, 12:00 to 13:00, 14:00 to 14:30, 16:00 to 17:00; 

Billy would like to avoid more meetings on Monday after 15:00. Find a time that works for everyone's schedule and constraints.

2) Donald attends the meeting at 09:30 on Monday — occupying the 09:30–10:00 (30-minute) slot.  
3) Raymond attends the meeting at 09:30 on Monday — occupying the 09:30–10:00 (30-minute) slot.

PROBLEM
------------------------------
You are an expert at scheduling meetings. You are given a few constraints on the existing schedule of each participant, the meeting duration, and possibly some preferences on the meeting time. Note there exists a solution that works with existing schedule of every participant. Here are a few example tasks and solutions:

TASK: You need to schedule a meeting for Roy, Kathryn and Amy for half an hour between the work hours of 9:00 to 17:00 on Monday. 

Here are the existing schedules for everyone during the day: 
Roy has blocked their calendar on Monday during 9:00 to 9:30, 10:00 to 10:30, 11:00 to 11:30, 12:30 to 13:00; 
Kathryn has meetings on Monday during 9:30 to 10:00, 16:30 to 17:00; 
Amy has blocked their calendar on Monday during 9:00 to 14:30, 15:00 to 16:00, 16:30 to 17:00; 

Amy would rather not meet on Monday after 15:30. Find a time that works for everyone's schedule and constraints.

NATURAL-PLAN sas_plan_1
------------------------------
1) Schedule meeting — Slot s1430 (Monday 14:30–15:00), duration 30 minutes.  
   - Participants: Roy, Kathryn, Amy.  
   - Effect: the meeting is marked scheduled and the overall goal (a 30-minute Monday meeting for Roy, Kathryn, and Amy) is achieved.  
   - Notes: This slot is before 15:30, so it respects Amy’s preference.
================================================================================


PROBLEM
------------------------------
You are an expert at scheduling meetings. You are given a few constraints on the existing schedule of each participant, the meeting duration, and possibly some preferences on the meeting time. Note there exists a solution that works with existing schedule of every participant. Here are a few example tasks and solutions:

TASK: You need to schedule a meeting for Arthur, Michael and Samantha for one hour between the work hours of 9:00 to 17:00 on Monday. 

Here are the existing schedules for everyone during the day: 
Arthur is busy on Monday during 9:00 to 9:30, 10:30 to 12:00, 16:00 to 17:00; 
Michael has meetings on Monday during 13:00 to 13:30, 14:00 to 14:30; 
Samantha has blocked their calendar on Monday during 10:30 to 11:00, 12:00 to 15:00, 15:30 to 17:00; 

Find a time that works for everyone's schedule and constraints.

FINAL-PLAN
------------------------------
availability_arthur:
- Busy intervals (hard constraints):
  - [09:00-09:30]
  - [10:30-12:00]
  - [16:00-17:00]
- Available half-hour segments on Monday (09:00–17:00, 30-min granularity): 09:30, 10:00, 12:00, 12:30, 13:00, 13:30, 14:00, 14:30, 15:00, 15:30

availability_michael:
- Busy intervals (hard constraints):
  - [13:00-13:30]
  - [14:00-14:30]
- Available half-hour segments: 09:00, 09:30, 10:00, 10:30, 11:00, 11:30, 12:00, 12:30, 13:30, 14:30, 15:00, 15:30, 16:00, 16:30

availability_samantha:
- Busy intervals (hard constraints):
  - [10:30-11:00]
  - [12:00-15:00]
  - [15:30-17:00]
- Available half-hour segments: 09:00, 09:30, 10:00, 11:00, 11:30, 15:00

Hard constraints / preferences (treated as strict):
- Meeting length: 60 minutes (must occupy two consecutive 30-minute segments).
- Meeting window: start no earlier than 09:00 and must finish no later than 17:00.
- Every busy interval listed above is strictly unavailable (cannot be used for any meeting segment).
- Prefer the earliest feasible meeting start consistent with the hard constraints.

Brief reasoning to choose earliest feasible slot:
- We discretize the day into 30-minute segments: 09:00 (s0), 09:30 (s1), 10:00 (s2), 10:30 (s3), 11:00 (s4), 11:30 (s5), 12:00 (s6), 12:30 (s7), 13:00 (s8), 13:30 (s9), 14:00 (s10), 14:30 (s11), 15:00 (s12), 15:30 (s13), 16:00 (s14), 16:30 (s15).
- For a 60-minute meeting we require two consecutive segments (s and next(s)).
- Check starts in chronological order:
  - s0 (09:00): Arthur is busy at 09:00 → not feasible.
  - s1 (09:30): requires s1 and s2. Arthur, Michael and Samantha are all available for s1 and s2 → feasible.
- Therefore the earliest feasible start that respects all hard constraints is 09:30 (meeting occupies 09:30–10:30, i.e., segments s1 and s2).

Now I provide the PDDL domain and problem suitable for FastDownwards. The model uses 30-minute segments and encodes each participant's availability as distinct predicates. The scheduling action requires that the two consecutive segments needed for the 1-hour meeting are available for each participant.

NATURAL-PLAN sas_plan_0
------------------------------
1) Schedule meeting (orchestrator): Book a 1-hour meeting on Monday from 09:30 to 10:30 (uses consecutive slots s1 and s2).
   - Duration: 60 minutes (two 30-minute slots: s1 = 09:30–10:00, s2 = 10:00–10:30)
   - Participants: Arthur, Michael, Samantha
   - Result: Meeting scheduled — all participants are available in s1 and s2, so the global goal is satisfied.
