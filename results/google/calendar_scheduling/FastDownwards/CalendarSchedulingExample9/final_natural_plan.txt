Based on the analysis of the PDDL artifacts and the goal of finding the earliest common 30-minute slot, the following sequence of actions is required:

| Step | PDDL Action | Human-Readable Instruction | Time Slot (30 mins) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 1 | `(schedule_s10)` | Schedule the 30-minute meeting, confirming that all participants (Diane, Kelly, and Deborah) are available during this timeframe, and establishing this as the final scheduled slot. | 14:00 to 14:30 |

The earliest common 30-minute slot for all participants is Monday, 14:00 to 14:30.
