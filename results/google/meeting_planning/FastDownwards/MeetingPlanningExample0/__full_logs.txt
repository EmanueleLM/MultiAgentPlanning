FINAL-PLAN
------------------------------
Candidate schedule proposals (earliest-first; all times HH:MM). Each proposal lists departure, arrival, meeting start/end, travel legs and whether the 120-minute minimum is satisfied.

1) Earliest feasible meeting (preferred)
- Travel leg: Marina District -> Mission District
  - Depart Marina District: 10:10
  - Travel duration: 20 minutes
  - Arrive Mission District: 10:30
- Meeting with Stephanie:
  - Start: 10:30
  - End: 12:30
  - Meeting duration: 120 minutes (meets minimum)
- Return leg: Mission District -> Marina District
  - Depart Mission District: 12:30
  - Travel duration: 19 minutes
  - Arrive Marina District: 12:49
- Notes: This is the earliest meeting start that satisfies Stephanie's availability (10:30–13:30) and the travel time constraint.

2) Early-arrival / wait then meet
- Travel leg: Marina District -> Mission District
  - Depart Marina District: 09:40
  - Travel duration: 20 minutes
  - Arrive Mission District: 10:00
  - Wait at Mission District: 10:00–10:30
- Meeting with Stephanie:
  - Start: 10:30
  - End: 12:30
  - Meeting duration: 120 minutes (meets minimum)
- Return leg:
  - Depart Mission District: 12:30
  - Travel duration: 19 minutes
  - Arrive Marina District: 12:49
- Notes: Arrive early and wait; meeting still starts at earliest feasible 10:30.

3) Mid-window meeting
- Travel leg:
  - Depart Marina District: 10:40
  - Travel duration: 20 minutes
  - Arrive Mission District: 11:00
- Meeting with Stephanie:
  - Start: 11:00
  - End: 13:00
  - Meeting duration: 120 minutes (meets minimum)
- Return leg:
  - Depart Mission District: 13:00
  - Travel duration: 19 minutes
  - Arrive Marina District: 13:19

4) Latest-possible contiguous meeting within Stephanie's window
- Travel leg:
  - Depart Marina District: 11:10
  - Travel duration: 20 minutes
  - Arrive Mission District: 11:30
- Meeting with Stephanie:
  - Start: 11:30
  - End: 13:30
  - Meeting duration: 120 minutes (meets minimum)
- Return leg:
  - Depart Mission District: 13:30
  - Travel duration: 19 minutes
  - Arrive Marina District: 13:49
- Notes: This is the latest contiguous 120-minute meeting that finishes at Stephanie's departure (13:30).

All proposals respect:
- Traveler initial arrival at Marina District at 09:00.
- Travel times: Marina->Mission = 20 min, Mission->Marina = 19 min.
- Stephanie availability: Mission District 10:30–13:30.
- Meeting minimum duration: 120 minutes contiguous.
- Earliest feasible meeting start is 10:30; proposals are ordered to prefer the earliest feasible slot.

PDDL Problem (start at Marina at 09:00, Stephanie at Mission 10:30–13:30 encoded via meet action constraints)
<problem>
(define (problem meet-stephanie-problem)
  (:domain travel-meetings)
  (:objects
    traveler stephanie - person
    MarinaDistrict MissionDistrict - location
  )
  (:init
    ;; traveler initial location (arrived at Marina District at 09:00)
    (at traveler MarinaDistrict)
    ;; Stephanie is at Mission District for the window (we model her presence as fixed)
    (at stephanie MissionDistrict)
    ;; global clock set to 09:00 = 540 minutes after midnight
    (= (time) 540)
  )
  (:goal (and
           (met traveler stephanie)
         ))
)
</problem>

Notes about the PDDL encoding and execution:
- Time units are minutes since midnight. 09:00 = 540, 10:30 = 630, 13:30 = 810.
- The domain uses durative actions that advance the global clock via numeric fluent (time).
- Stephanie's availability window is enforced by the meet-stephanie action start conditions:
  - meeting start >= 630 and meeting start + 120 <= 810, so the 120-minute contiguous requirement is encoded as a hard constraint.
- The initial state does not invent any availability beyond the provided data: Stephanie is present at MissionDistrict (no actions move her).
- The planner should find the earliest possible meeting schedule that achieves (met traveler stephanie). The earliest feasible start is 10:30 (proposal 1).

NATURAL-PLAN sas_plan_5
------------------------------
1) Advance time (wait) from 09:00 to 10:10 — remain at Marina District.  
   - Timestamp: 09:00 → 10:10  
   - Duration: 70 minutes

2) Travel from Marina District to Mission District, departing at 10:10 and arriving at 10:30.  
   - Departure: 10:10 (from Marina District)  
   - Travel duration: 20 minutes  
   - Arrival: 10:30 (at Mission District)

3) Meet Stephanie at Mission District from 10:30 to 12:30.  
   - Meeting window used: 10:30 → 12:30  
   - Meeting duration: 120 minutes (meets the required minimum)  
   - Result: traveler has met Stephanie (goal achieved)

Plan cost: 3 (unit cost).
