Include actions: wait, move between locations using given travel times, start_meeting and continue_meeting with Jessica, ensuring at least 6 consecutive 15-minute steps of meeting. 3) The problem should instantiate all required time steps from 09:00 to 21:00, the initial traveler location, availability windows, and goal conditions that guarantee the continuous 90-minute meeting with Jessica and completion at or before day_end. Enclose the domain and problem in the required tags and do not include any extra text."

Rationale: Satisfies the 90-min requirement well within her 480\u2013690 window, earliest finish, leaves time for other potential meetings if they existed.\n\n- Schedule B: Start later, still meet minimum.\n  1) Wait at Bayview 10 minutes: 540\u2013550 (09:00\u201309:10).\n  2) Travel Bayview -> Golden Gate Park: 550\u2013572 (09:10\u201309:32).\n  3) Meet Barbara 90 minutes: 572\u2013662 (09:32\u201311:02).\n  End time: 662 (11:02). Feasible but finishes later with no added benefit.\n\n- Schedule C: Longer catch-up with Barbara (preference), exceeding minimum.\n  1) Travel Bayview -> Golden Gate Park: 540\u2013562 (09:00\u201309:22).\n  2) Meet Barbara 100 minutes: 562\u2013662 (09:22\u201311:02) in 10\u00d710-min blocks.\n  End time: 662 (11:02).

Rationale: Satisfies the 90-min requirement well within her 480\u2013690 window, earliest finish, leaves time for other potential meetings if they existed.\n\n- Schedule B: Start later, still meet minimum.\n  1) Wait at Bayview 10 minutes: 540\u2013550 (09:00\u201309:10).\n  2) Travel Bayview -> Golden Gate Park: 550\u2013572 (09:10\u201309:32).\n  3) Meet Barbara 90 minutes: 572\u2013662 (09:32\u201311:02).\n  End time: 662 (11:02).

    "proposed_solution": "Best schedule (minimizes total travel cost while meeting William for at least 75 minutes within his availability):\n- Start: 09:00 at Nob Hill (t0).\n- Wait at Nob Hill until 11:58 (t178).\n- Travel Nob Hill -> The Castro: depart 11:58, 17 minutes travel, arrive 12:15 (t195).\n- Meet William at The Castro: 12:15\u201313:30, 75 minutes (t195\u2013t270).\n- End of required goals at 13:30. No return trip needed to satisfy the goal or reduce cost.\n\nRationale:\n- William\u2019s earliest availability is 12:15 (t195). Any valid plan must advance time to at least t195, incurring at least 195 units of cost (since both waiting and moving accrue 1 cost per minute advanced). Arriving exactly at 12:15 and starting the 75-minute meeting immediately achieves the goal with minimum possible total-cost. Departing earlier and waiting at The Castro yields the same pre-meeting cost; departing later increases cost. Thus, the chosen timing is optimal."

No return trip needed to satisfy the goal or reduce cost.\n\nRationale:\n- William\u2019s earliest availability is 12:15 (t195). Any valid plan must advance time to at least t195, incurring at least 195 units of cost (since both waiting and moving accrue 1 cost per minute advanced). Arriving exactly at 12:15 and starting the 75-minute meeting immediately achieves the goal with minimum possible total-cost. Departing earlier and waiting at The Castro yields the same pre-meeting cost; departing later increases cost. Thus, the chosen timing is optimal."

No return trip needed to satisfy the goal or reduce cost.\n\nRationale:\n- William\u2019s earliest availability is 12:15 (t195). Any valid plan must advance time to at least t195, incurring at least 195 units of cost (since both waiting and moving accrue 1 cost per minute advanced). Arriving exactly at 12:15 and starting the 75-minute meeting immediately achieves the goal with minimum possible total-cost. Departing earlier and waiting at The Castro yields the same pre-meeting cost; departing later increases cost. Thus, the chosen timing is optimal."

FINAL-PLAN
------------------------------
Selected schedule: S2_max_time_with_kenneth (maximizes friends met; tie-broken by least idle time by using full 14:15–19:45 meeting window). The PDDL below uses 5-minute discrete time steps. Travel between Fisherman's Wharf and Nob Hill takes 11 minutes and is conservatively rounded up to 15 minutes (encoded by requiring three successive 5-minute steps). Waiting is explicit. Meeting progresses in 5-minute quanta; the goal requires reaching 18 quanta (90 minutes).

Requirements: 1) Use a classical, STRIPS-like encoding with discrete time steps (5-minute increments). 2) Model locations, timepoints, the agent position, and meeting commitments. 3) Encode travel actions with preconditions/effects that move between locations and advance time according to the 11-minute durations by rounding to the nearest compatible discrete step you choose and documenting the choice in comments. 4) Encode waiting as an action that advances time. 5) Encode meeting actions that are permitted only when at the correct location within Kenneth's window and that accumulate at least 90 minutes total. 6) Initial state includes start location Fisherman's Wharf at time 09:00. 7) Goal requires meeting Kenneth for at least 90 minutes.

You always provide exactly one PDDL domain and one PDDL problem, enclosed respectively between <domain></domain> and <problem></problem> tags. You keep actions and objects interpretable, and you avoid unsupported features. Where durations are needed, either discretize time into minutes or encode time steps so that FastDownwards can solve the problem as a classical planning instance. You preserve feasibility constraints, including Stephanie's 105-minute meeting minimum and directed travel times, and you encode the objective as a plan-quality criterion if possible or otherwise provide a best feasible plan selection rationale in comments within the problem.",

Distances: {distance_matrix}. Stephanie availability: {stephanie_availability}. Integrate these to produce a final PDDL domain and problem suitable for FastDownwards. Requirements: include objects for locations (at least Chinatown and MarinaDistrict), agents or roles as needed, actions for travel with direction-specific applicability, actions for meet_stephanie subject to availability and a minimum of 105 minutes represented via discretized time steps or equivalent modeling. Encode initial state as starting at Chinatown at 09:00, incorporate known travel times only, and avoid assuming any other travel edges. Optimize for maximum meetings while guaranteeing the Stephanie constraint; if multiple candidate schedules exist, choose the best feasible one and reflect it in the initial goals or metric. Output the PDDL domain between <domain></domain> and the PDDL problem between <problem></problem>."

You always provide exactly one PDDL domain and one PDDL problem, enclosed respectively between <domain></domain> and <problem></problem> tags. You keep actions and objects interpretable, and you avoid unsupported features. Where durations are needed, either discretize time into minutes or encode time steps so that FastDownwards can solve the problem as a classical planning instance. You preserve feasibility constraints, including Stephanie's 105-minute meeting minimum and directed travel times, and you encode the objective as a plan-quality criterion if possible or otherwise provide a best feasible plan selection rationale in comments within the problem.",

Distances: {distance_matrix}. Stephanie availability: {stephanie_availability}. Integrate these to produce a final PDDL domain and problem suitable for FastDownwards. Requirements: include objects for locations (at least Chinatown and MarinaDistrict), agents or roles as needed, actions for travel with direction-specific applicability, actions for meet_stephanie subject to availability and a minimum of 105 minutes represented via discretized time steps or equivalent modeling. Encode initial state as starting at Chinatown at 09:00, incorporate known travel times only, and avoid assuming any other travel edges. Optimize for maximum meetings while guaranteeing the Stephanie constraint; if multiple candidate schedules exist, choose the best feasible one and reflect it in the initial goals or metric. Output the PDDL domain between <domain></domain> and the PDDL problem between <problem></problem>."
