NATURAL-PLAN sas_plan_5
------------------------------
1) start-meeting(barbara, barbara) at Golden Gate Park
   - Planned time window: from t82 to t171
   - Interpreting t60 = 09:00 and travel time = 22 minutes (t60 -> t82):
     - Meeting start (t82) = 09:22
     - Meeting end (t171) = 09:22 + 90 minutes = 10:52
   - Duration: 90 minutes (09:22–10:52)
   - Effect: meeting goal achieved (met)

Result: The plan marks the meeting as completed (met) by holding a 90‑minute meeting at Golden Gate Park from 09:22 to 10:52.

FINAL-PLAN
------------------------------
I don’t yet have the two agents’ PDDL inputs you mentioned. To produce a correct integrated model I need their domain/problem descriptions (or at least: agent names, locations, initial locations, availability windows, meeting duration, and travel durations). Please paste both agents’ descriptions or PDDL fragments.

While you prepare those inputs, here is a working integrated template/example that demonstrates the conventions I will use and is compatible with Fast Downward’s numeric PDDL features. It:

- Keeps each agent’s actions namespaced (agentA_*, agentB_*).
- Represents a global current-time numeric fluent and numeric availability windows per agent.
- Models travel as instantaneous actions that advance current-time by a travel-time numeric fluent.
- Accumulates the visitor’s travel time into total-cost, and sets the problem metric to minimize total-cost.
- Includes a joint orchestrator action to start the meeting when both agents are co-located and both availability windows permit the meeting duration.

Use this as a template or example. When you supply the agents’ information I will replace the example objects/values and produce a tailored integrated domain + problem.

Notes and next steps:
- This template assumes agentA is the "visitor" whose travel cost we want to minimize. If the visitor is the other agent, I will swap which agent contributes to total-cost.
- To produce a precise integrated model I need the two agents’ inputs (domains or descriptive summaries). Please provide:
  - Agent identifiers (names).
  - All locations of interest and synonyms (so I can unify names).
  - Each agent's initial location.
  - Each agent's availability window(s) (start and end times).
  - Meeting duration required.
  - Travel durations between relevant locations for each agent (or a travel-time function or matrix).
  - Any additional constraints (e.g., earliest/latest meeting start, must-meet-at specific place(s), agent-specific constraints).
- I will then:
  1) reconcile object naming (unify synonyms),
  2) encode availability windows and travel times into the integrated problem,
  3) keep actions namespaced (agentA_*, agentB_*),
  4) produce a final PDDL domain and problem ready for Fast Downward, and
  5) if requested, provide notes on how the solution schedule corresponds to time and actions.

Send the two agent descriptions and I’ll create the tailored integrated PDDL files.

NATURAL-PLAN sas_plan_7
------------------------------
1) Start the meeting at The Castro at t195 (12:15).  
   - Participants: visitor and William (both at The Castro from t195 through t269).  
   - William is available for the entire interval t195–t269 (his stated availability begins at 12:15).  
   - Duration: 75 minutes (t195 through t269 inclusive) — from 12:15 until 13:30.  
   - Result: meeting scheduled (goal achieved).

Note: Given the visitor starts the day at Nob Hill at 09:00 and travel time Nob Hill→The Castro is 17 minutes, the visitor must depart Nob Hill by 11:58 to arrive at The Castro by 12:15, so the 75-minute meeting can begin on time.

NATURAL-PLAN sas_plan_3
------------------------------
Assumptions used to add timestamps: Kenneth is available 2:15 PM–7:45 PM and the meeting must last 90 minutes. I map the chosen can-start time t1000 to 2:15 PM so the 90-minute meeting runs 2:15 PM–3:45 PM. Below I translate each PDDL action in the provided plan, in order, matching every action exactly.

NATURAL-PLAN sas_plan_8
------------------------------
Step 1 — travel-traveler (t0 → t12)
- Action: Traveler goes from Chinatown to Marina District.
- Timestamp: departs/starts at t0 = 09:00 and arrives at t12 = 09:12.
- Duration: 12 minutes (Chinatown → Marina = 12 min).

Step 2 — start-meeting (t12 → t117)
- Action: Begin meeting between the Traveler and Stephanie at Marina District.
- Timestamp: meeting starts at t12 = 09:12 and ends at t117 = 10:57.
- Duration: 105 minutes (from 09:12 to 10:57).
- Result: Both agents are at Marina at 10:57 and the meeting requirement (minimum 105 minutes) is satisfied.

Plan cost: 2 (unit cost).

------------------------------
1) Travel — Visitor: depart Golden Gate Park -> Marina District
   - Agent: visitor
   - From: Golden Gate Park
   - To: Marina District
   - Travel time: 16 minutes (public info)
   - Suggested timing: depart 09:59, arrive 10:15
     (visitor is at Golden Gate Park from 09:00; arriving at 10:15 ensures overlap with James’ availability starting 10:15)

2) Meet — Visitor and James at Marina District
   - Agents: visitor and james
   - Location: Marina District
   - Start time: 10:15 (upon visitor’s arrival / start of James’ availability)
   - Duration: at least 15 minutes (meeting ends no earlier than 10:30)
   - Outcome: meeting completed (goal “met” achieved for both agents)

NATURAL-PLAN sas_plan_3
------------------------------
1) Traveler: Move from Marina District to Richmond District.
   - Departure: Marina District (traveler is at Marina from 09:00 and can wait).
   - Travel time: 11 minutes (Marina -> Richmond).
   - Example timing that satisfies Betty's availability: depart Marina at 20:34, arrive Richmond at 20:45.

2) Traveler: Meet with Betty at Richmond District.
   - Preconditions met: traveler is at Richmond and Betty is available (Betty is available at Richmond 20:30–22:00).
   - Meeting duration: 75 minutes (minimum required).
   - Example timing: meet from 20:45 to 22:00 (75 minutes), which finishes exactly at the end of Betty's availability window.
   - Effect: the meeting requirement (met75) is satisfied.

These two steps correspond exactly to the plan given: (traveler-move-m2r) then (traveler-meet-with-betty), using the 11-minute travel time and scheduling the 75-minute meeting within Betty's 20:30–22:00 window.
