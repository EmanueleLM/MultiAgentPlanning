1) Traveler: Move from Marina District to Richmond District.
   - Departure: Marina District (traveler is at Marina from 09:00 and can wait).
   - Travel time: 11 minutes (Marina -> Richmond).
   - Example timing that satisfies Betty's availability: depart Marina at 20:34, arrive Richmond at 20:45.

2) Traveler: Meet with Betty at Richmond District.
   - Preconditions met: traveler is at Richmond and Betty is available (Betty is available at Richmond 20:30–22:00).
   - Meeting duration: 75 minutes (minimum required).
   - Example timing: meet from 20:45 to 22:00 (75 minutes), which finishes exactly at the end of Betty's availability window.
   - Effect: the meeting requirement (met75) is satisfied.

These two steps correspond exactly to the plan given: (traveler-move-m2r) then (traveler-meet-with-betty), using the 11-minute travel time and scheduling the 75-minute meeting within Betty's 20:30–22:00 window.
