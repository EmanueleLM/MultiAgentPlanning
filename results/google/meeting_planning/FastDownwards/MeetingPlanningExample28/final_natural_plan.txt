Summary of the plan (human-readable timeline). This follows the provided plan exactly (same sequence of actions, counts and timestamps), expressed as clear steps and timestamps.

1) Start
- At 09:00 (t540) you are at Union Square.

2) Repeated alternating travel: Union Square <-> Chinatown (539 one-minute travel actions)
- From 09:00 onward you repeatedly travel back and forth between Union Square and Chinatown, one minute per travel action.
- The very first travel action is:
  - 09:00 → 09:01 (t540 → t541): travel from Union Square to Chinatown.
- Then you alternate: 09:01→09:02 travel Chinatown→Union Square, 09:02→09:03 travel Union Square→Chinatown, and so on.
- This alternating travel pattern is executed 539 times in total (the exact sequence in the plan begins with travel-you-us-to-ch t540 t541 and continues alternating travel-you-ch-to-us and travel-you-us-to-ch).
- As a result of these 539 one-minute travels you advance from t540 (09:00) to t1079 (17:59), and you end up at Chinatown at time t1079 (17:59). (Parity: starting at Union Square and performing an odd number of moves leaves you in Chinatown.)

3) Wait at Chinatown (1 minute)
- 17:59 → 18:00 (t1079 → t1080): you wait at Chinatown for one minute. (Action in plan: you-wait-at-ch t1079 t1080.)

4) Joshua arrives at Chinatown
- At 18:00 (t1080): Joshua arrives at Chinatown. (Action in plan: joshua-arrive-chinatown t1080.)

5) Meeting with Joshua — 75 one-minute meeting actions (total 75 minutes)
- Starting 18:00 (t1080) you and Joshua meet in Chinatown.
- The meeting proceeds minute-by-minute using the plan’s you-meet-with-joshua actions:
  - 18:00 → 18:01 (t1080 → t1081): first meeting minute (m0 → m1)
  - 18:01 → 18:02 (t1081 → t1082): second meeting minute (m1 → m2)
  - ...
  - This pattern continues consecutively for 75 meeting actions.
- The meeting covers the continuous interval 18:00 to 19:15 (t1080 → t1155), which is 75 minutes in total.
- The final meeting action in the plan is 19:14 → 19:15 (t1154 → t1155) and advances the meeting index to m75. (Action in plan: you-meet-with-joshua t1154 t1155 m74 m75.)

6) Goal achieved
- After the 75-minute meeting (ending 19:15), the plan has achieved met m75, satisfying the requirement to meet Joshua for at least 75 minutes.
- Total actions in the plan: 616 unit-cost actions (539 travel actions + 1 wait + 1 Joshua-arrive + 75 you-meet actions = 616). The plan’s cost = 616 as given.

Notes tying this to the specification
- Travel duration used in the plan is expressed as one-minute steps (each next_time increment is one minute). The plan simulates repeated 1-minute travel steps that together consume time until 17:59; the essential effect is you place yourself in Chinatown at 17:59 and then wait one minute until 18:00.
- Joshua’s availability begins at 18:00 (time_ge1080), and the plan has him present at Chinatown from 18:00 onward to allow the continuous 75-minute meeting between 18:00 and 19:15.
- The final goal (meeting Joshua for at least 75 minutes) is satisfied exactly by the 75 consecutive you-meet-with-joshua actions from t1080 to t1155.

If you want, I can:
- Expand the alternating travel sequence into an explicit, line-by-line list of each of the 539 travel actions with timestamps, or
- Produce a compact minute-by-minute timeline table for the whole day (09:00–19:15).
