Outcome:
- Total meeting time with Stephanie: 120 minutes (10:38–12:38), within her availability window (10:30–13:30).
- Final location: Mission District at 12:38.
- All steps mirror the provided PDDL plan exactly.

Avoid durative actions; instead represent time as a sequence of step predicates or successor relations and use action preconditions to respect availability windows. Include actions: wait, move between locations using given travel times, start_meeting and continue_meeting with Jessica, ensuring at least 6 consecutive 15-minute steps of meeting. 3) The problem should instantiate all required time steps from 09:00 to 21:00, the initial traveler location, availability windows, and goal conditions that guarantee the continuous 90-minute meeting with Jessica and completion at or before day_end. Enclose the domain and problem in the required tags and do not include any extra text."

Rationale: Satisfies the 90-min requirement well within her 480\u2013690 window, earliest finish, leaves time for other potential meetings if they existed.\n\n- Schedule B: Start later, still meet minimum.\n  1) Wait at Bayview 10 minutes: 540\u2013550 (09:00\u201309:10).\n  2) Travel Bayview -> Golden Gate Park: 550\u2013572 (09:10\u201309:32).\n  3) Meet Barbara 90 minutes: 572\u2013662 (09:32\u201311:02).\n  End time: 662 (11:02). Feasible but finishes later with no added benefit.\n\n- Schedule C: Longer catch-up with Barbara (preference), exceeding minimum.\n  1) Travel Bayview -> Golden Gate Park: 540\u2013562 (09:00\u201309:22).\n  2) Meet Barbara 100 minutes: 562\u2013662 (09:22\u201311:02) in 10\u00d710-min blocks.\n  End time: 662 (11:02).

Rationale: Satisfies the 90-min requirement well within her 480\u2013690 window, earliest finish, leaves time for other potential meetings if they existed.\n\n- Schedule B: Start later, still meet minimum.\n  1) Wait at Bayview 10 minutes: 540\u2013550 (09:00\u201309:10).\n  2) Travel Bayview -> Golden Gate Park: 550\u2013572 (09:10\u201309:32).\n  3) Meet Barbara 90 minutes: 572\u2013662 (09:32\u201311:02).\n  End time: 662 (11:02). Feasible but finishes later with no added benefit.\n\n- Schedule C: Longer catch-up with Barbara (preference), exceeding minimum.\n  1) Travel Bayview -> Golden Gate Park: 540\u2013562 (09:00\u201309:22).\n  2) Meet Barbara 100 minutes: 562\u2013662 (09:22\u201311:02) in 10\u00d710-min blocks.\n  End time: 662 (11:02).
