1) Travel (travel-traveler-fw-to-nobhill t540 → t551)
- Traveler departs Fisherman's Wharf at t540 (09:00) and travels to Nob Hill, arriving at t551 (09:11).
- Travel duration: 11 minutes. (This corresponds exactly to the action travel-traveler-fw-to-nobhill t540 t551.)
- Cost increase: +11 (minutes) to total-cost.

2) Wait at Nob Hill (the sequence of one-minute wait actions)
- The traveler then performs a sequence of 304 one-minute wait actions at Nob Hill. Each wait action corresponds exactly to a plan step of the form (wait-traveler nob-hill tXXX tXXX+1).
- These waits cover the continuous interval from arrival at 09:11 (t551) up to the meeting start at 14:15 (t855). Concretely:
  - Wait 1: t551 → t552 = 09:11 → 09:12
  - Wait 2: t552 → t553 = 09:12 → 09:13
  - Wait 3: t553 → t554 = 09:13 → 09:14
  - ...
  - Wait 300+: continuing minute-by-minute ...
  - Final wait in this sequence: t854 → t855 = 14:14 → 14:15
- (These 304 waits correspond exactly to the plan's repeated lines (wait-traveler nob-hill t551 t552) ... (wait-traveler nob-hill t854 t855).)

3) Meet Kenneth for 90 minutes (meet-traveler-kenneth-90 t855 → t945)
- Meeting start: t855 = 14:15. Both traveler and Kenneth are at Nob Hill at this time and Kenneth is present/available.
- Meeting end: t945 = 15:45.
- Meeting duration: 90 minutes. (This corresponds exactly to the action meet-traveler-kenneth-90 t855 t945 and satisfies the requirement to meet Kenneth for at least 90 minutes.)
- Effect: the goal predicate met-kenneth is achieved.

Summary / notes
- Total actions in the plan: 306 actions (1 travel + 304 one-minute waits + 1 meeting).
- Time-line summary:
  - 09:00 — depart Fisherman's Wharf
  - 09:11 — arrive Nob Hill
  - 09:11–14:15 — wait at Nob Hill (continuous minute-by-minute waiting; 304 one-minute wait actions)
  - 14:15–15:45 — meet Kenneth (90 minutes)
- Final planning objective achieved: met-kenneth. Final recorded travel cost in the plan: 11 (minutes), matching the single travel action's cost increase.
