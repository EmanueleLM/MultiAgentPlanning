    "response": "SOLUTION:\n\nSummary of constraints & travel\n- You arrive in the Marina District at 9:00 AM.\n- Stephanie is in the Mission District 10:30\u201313:30.\n- You must spend at least 120 minutes with Stephanie.\n- Travel times: Marina \u2192 Mission = 20 min; Mission \u2192 Marina = 19 min.\n\nConsidered schedule options\n1) Maximize number of different people you can meet (best for \u201cmeet as many friends as possible\u201d)\n- Leave Marina at 10:10 \u2192 arrive Mission 10:30.\n- Meet Stephanie 10:30\u201312:30 (120 minutes, meets the minimum).\n- Leave Mission at 12:30 \u2192 arrive Marina 12:49.\n- Result: You are back in the Marina before 1:00 PM and can see other friends or appointments in the afternoon. This maximizes chances to meet additional people because you free up the most post-Stephanie time.\n\n2) Maximize time with Stephanie\n- Leave Marina at 10:10 \u2192 arrive Mission 10:30.\n- Meet Stephanie 10:30\u201313:30 (180 minutes).\n- Leave Mission at 13:30 \u2192 arrive Marina 13:49.\n- Result: You spend the full window with Stephanie but reduce afternoon availability for others.\n\n3) Delay departure and still meet the minimum (good if you want a longer Marina morning)\n- Leave Marina at 11:10 \u2192 arrive Mission 11:30.\n- Meet Stephanie 11:30\u201313:30 (120 minutes).\n- Leave Mission at 13:30 \u2192 arrive Marina 13:49.\n- Result: You get more Marina time in the morning but less time afterward to meet others.\n\nRecommendation (best given your stated goal: meet as many friends as possible)\n- Choose option 1. It satisfies the 120-minute minimum with Stephanie and returns you to the Marina early (12:49), giving you the most afternoon time to meet additional friends.\n\nPractical tips\n- Leave a 5\u201310 minute buffer if you expect delays: e.g., depart 10:05\u201310:10.\n- If you confirm other friends\u2019 availability now, you can adjust to Option 2 or 3 as needed.\n- If you want, tell me how many additional friends/what time windows they have and I\u2019ll produce an optimized hourly plan."

    ],
    "response": "SOLUTION:\nBelow are feasible schedules and a recommended choice based on your goal of meeting as many friends as possible while guaranteeing at least 60 minutes with Betty.\n\nKey facts / constraints\n- You arrive Richmond District at 9:00 AM.\n- Betty is in Financial District 5:15 PM\u20139:45 PM.\n- You must meet Betty at least 60 minutes.\n- Travel times: Richmond \u2192 Financial = 22 min. Financial \u2192 Richmond = 21 min.\n- Betty\u2019s 60\u2011minute meeting must start no earlier than 5:15 PM and finish no later than 9:45 PM, so the meeting start time must be between 5:15 PM and 8:45 PM.\n\nOption A \u2014 Maximize meeting other friends in Richmond (recommended if most friends are in Richmond)\n- Stay in Richmond all day to meet Richmond friends.\n- Depart Richmond at 8:23 PM (22 min travel) \u2192 arrive Financial 8:45 PM.\n- Meet Betty 8:45\u20139:45 PM (60 min).\n- Optional return to Richmond: depart 9:45 PM \u2192 arrive Richmond 10:06 PM (21 min).\nWhy choose this: you preserve the maximum daytime availability in Richmond for meeting as many friends as possible and still satisfy the 60\u2011minute minimum with Betty.\n\nOption B \u2014 Meet Betty early and maximize time afterwards in Financial\n- Depart Richmond at 4:53 PM \u2192 arrive Financial 5:15 PM.\n- Meet Betty 5:15\u20136:15 PM (60 min) or extend as long as you like up to 9:45 PM.\n- If you only need 60 min with Betty and also want to meet Financial friends after, you can stay longer; if you want to return to Richmond after 60 min: depart Financial 6:15 PM \u2192 arrive Richmond 6:36 PM.\nWhy choose this: good if you want to meet Financial\u2011District friends after meeting Betty, or if some important friends are only available earlier in Financial.\n\nOption C \u2014 Balanced split (meet some Richmond friends during the day, arrive earlier in Financial to meet more Financial friends plus Betty)\n- Example: depart Richmond at 6:38 PM \u2192 arrive Financial 7:00 PM.\n- Meet Betty 7:00\u20138:00 PM (60 min) and use 8:00\u20139:45 PM for additional Financial friends or to extend the Betty meeting.\nWhy choose this: useful if you have meaningful commitments in both districts and want a compromise.\n\nPractical recommendations\n- If your priority is literally \u201cmeet as many friends as possible\u201d and most friends are in Richmond during the day, choose Option A (leave at 8:23 PM). That maximizes time available to meet Richmond friends while guaranteeing the 60\u2011minute meeting with Betty.\n- If several friends are in the Financial District in the evening (before 8:45 PM) and you want to see them too, pick Option C or B and shift your Richmond departure earlier accordingly.\n- Add a small buffer (5\u201310 minutes) to departure times for unexpected delays or to be comfortably on time.\n\nIf you tell me where/when your other friends will be (which neighborhoods and their availability windows), I can generate an optimal minute-by-minute schedule that maximizes the number of friends you can meet."
