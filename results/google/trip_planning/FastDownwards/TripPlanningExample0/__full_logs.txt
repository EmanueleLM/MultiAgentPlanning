PROBLEM
------------------------------
You plan to visit 3 European cities for 14 days in total. You only take direct flights to commute between cities. You would like to visit Florence for 6 days. You want to meet a friend in Florence between day 9 and day 14. You would like to visit Barcelona for 5 days. You would like to visit Helsinki for 5 days.

Here are the cities that have direct flights:
Barcelona and Florence, Helsinki and Barcelona.

Find a trip plan of visiting the cities for 14 days by taking direct flights to commute between them.

3) (stay day3 day4 barcelona) — Day 3 → Day 4: stay in Barcelona (remain in Barcelona on Day 4).  
4) (stay day4 day5 barcelona) — Day 4 → Day 5: stay in Barcelona (remain in Barcelona on Day 5).  
5) (fly day5 day6 barcelona helsinki) — Between Day 5 and Day 6: take a direct flight from Barcelona to Helsinki, arriving on Day 6.  
6) (stay day6 day7 helsinki) — Day 6 → Day 7: stay in Helsinki (remain in Helsinki on Day 7).  
7) (fly day7 day8 helsinki barcelona) — Between Day 7 and Day 8: take a direct flight from Helsinki to Barcelona, arriving on Day 8.

13) (stay day13 day14 florence) — Day 13 → Day 14: stay in Florence (remain in Florence on Day 14).

Notes:
- Daily allocation produced by these actions:
  - Barcelona: Days 1–5 (5 days)  
  - Helsinki: Days 6–7 (2 days)  
  - Barcelona transit: Day 8 (arrival in Barcelona on Day 8, then depart to Florence the same transition)  
  - Florence: Days 9–14 (6 days)
- The required Florence meeting window (between Day 9 and Day 14 inclusive) is satisfied (visiting Florence on Days 9–14).  
- Plan comment: total cost = 13 (as in the provided plan).
