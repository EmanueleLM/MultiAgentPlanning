PROBLEM
------------------------------
You plan to visit 3 European cities for 14 days in total. You only take direct flights to commute between cities. You would like to visit Florence for 6 days. You want to meet a friend in Florence between day 9 and day 14. You would like to visit Barcelona for 5 days. You would like to visit Helsinki for 5 days.

Here are the cities that have direct flights:
Barcelona and Florence, Helsinki and Barcelona.

Find a trip plan of visiting the cities for 14 days by taking direct flights to commute between them.

FINAL-PLAN
------------------------------
<domain>
; Domain: Integrated traveler + flight_planner for a 14-day trip
; Assumptions & resolution of inconsistencies:
; - The traveler requested 6 days Florence, 5 days Barcelona, and 5 days Helsinki (sum 16 > 14).
;   To obtain a feasible 14-day plan while preserving the hard constraints (14 total days, meeting in Florence day9..day14,
;   and only direct flights BCN<->FLO and HEL<->BCN), we allocate:
;     Barcelona = 5 days (day1..day5)
;     Helsinki  = 3 days (day6..day8)  -- reduced to fit total days
;     Florence  = 6 days (day9..day14)
;   This choice preserves Florence = 6 (meeting window) and Barcelona = 5; Helsinki was reduced to fit the total available days.
; - Start city is assumed to be Barcelona (needed to make the problem solvable given available connections).
; - Flights are modeled by the flight_planner actions and do NOT advance the day: flights are instantaneous movements within a day.
; - Stays advance the day (one day consumed per stay). Meeting is an explicit action taken when the traveler is in Florence on a day in the meeting window.
; Agent attribution:
; - Actions prefixed with "traveler-" belong to the traveler agent (stays and meeting).
; - Actions prefixed with "flight_planner-" belong to the flight_planner agent (flights).
