PROBLEM
------------------------------
You plan to visit 3 European cities for 14 days in total. You only take direct flights to commute between cities. You would like to visit Florence for 6 days. You want to meet a friend in Florence between day 9 and day 14. You would like to visit Barcelona for 5 days. You would like to visit Helsinki for 5 days.

Here are the cities that have direct flights:
Barcelona and Florence, Helsinki and Barcelona.

Find a trip plan of visiting the cities for 14 days by taking direct flights to commute between them.

; Problem: 14-day trip scheduling among Florence, Barcelona, Helsinki
; Notes and orchestration decisions (trade-offs documented here):
; - Agents requested total days = Florence 6 + Barcelona 5 + Helsinki 5 = 16 > available 14.
; - Mandatory constraint: meet friend in Florence sometime between day9 and day14 inclusive.
; - To honor the mandatory meeting window and approximate preferences, I allocate:
;     Florence: 6 days (days 9-14)    <- meets the meeting window exactly and preserves Florence's full 6-day request
;     Barcelona: 4 days  (days 1-2, 7-8) 
;     Helsinki: 4 days   (days 3-6)
;   This allocation reduces Barcelona and Helsinki requests by 1 day each (from 5->4), keeping Florence fully satisfied.
; - Starting location is not specified by inputs. To create a feasible schedule respecting direct-flight constraints
;   (Florence <-> Barcelona, Helsinki <-> Barcelona; no direct Florence<->Helsinki), I set the start to Barcelona on day1.
;   This choice is required to allow travel HEL <-> BCN transitions and to reach Florence by day9 via Barcelona.
; - Sequence rationale (feasible with only direct flights):
;     Day1-2: Barcelona
;     Fly BCN->HEL overnight (arrive day3)
;     Day3-6: Helsinki (4 days)
;     Fly HEL->BCN overnight (arrive day7)
;     Day7-8: Barcelona
;     Fly BCN->FLR overnight (arrive day9)
;     Day9-14: Florence (6 days, meeting occurs within day9..day14)
; - All preferences were treated as strong constraints; when infeasible in aggregate, Florence's meeting and full Florence duration were prioritized,
;   and Barcelona/Helinski were reduced equally to best approximate their requests.
; - The planner must use only direct flights encoded below via the (connected ...) facts.

NATURAL-PLAN sas_plan_4
------------------------------
Summary
- Start: in Helsinki on day 1.
- The plan uses only direct flights (Helsinki↔Barcelona, Barcelona↔Florence) and schedules stays so the mandatory meeting in Florence happens within day 9–14.
- Total plan cost reported: 13.

Step-by-step itinerary (each step matches the plan exactly)

1) stay helsinki day1 → day2
   - Action: Remain in Helsinki.
   - Effect: You are in Helsinki on day 1 and also on day 2 (the stay advances you from day1 to day2).

2) stay helsinki day2 → day3
   - Action: Remain in Helsinki.
   - Effect: You are in Helsinki on day 3.

3) fly helsinki barcelona day3 → day4
   - Action: Take a direct flight from Helsinki to Barcelona overnight between day 3 and day 4.
   - Effect: You arrive in Barcelona on day 4.

4) stay barcelona day4 → day5
   - Action: Remain in Barcelona.
   - Effect: You are in Barcelona on day 4 and day 5.

5) stay barcelona day5 → day6
   - Action: Remain in Barcelona.
   - Effect: You are in Barcelona on day 6.

6) stay barcelona day6 → day7
   - Action: Remain in Barcelona.
   - Effect: You are in Barcelona on day 7.

7) stay barcelona day7 → day8
   - Action: Remain in Barcelona.
   - Effect: You are in Barcelona on day 8.

8) fly barcelona florence day8 → day9
   - Action: Take a direct flight from Barcelona to Florence overnight between day 8 and day 9.
   - Effect: You arrive in Florence on day 9.

9) stay florence day9 → day10
   - Action: Remain in Florence.
   - Effect: You are in Florence on day 9 and day 10.

10) stay florence day10 → day11
    - Action: Remain in Florence.
    - Effect: You are in Florence on day 11.

11) stay florence day11 → day12
    - Action: Remain in Florence.
    - Effect: You are in Florence on day 12.

12) stay florence day12 → day13
    - Action: Remain in Florence.
    - Effect: You are in Florence on day 13.

13) stay florence day13 → day14
    - Action: Remain in Florence.
    - Effect: You are in Florence on day 14.

Final itinerary by day (coverage)
- Helsinki: days 1–3 (3 days total)
- Barcelona: days 4–8 (5 days total)
- Florence: days 9–14 (6 days total)

Notes on constraints and trade-offs
- The mandatory meeting in Florence is scheduled within day 9–14 (Florence visit covers days 9 through 14), so the meeting constraint is satisfied.
- Agents requested stays: Florence 6 days, Barcelona 5 days, Helsinki 5 days; total requested = 16 > available 14 days. The plan honors the Florence 6-day requirement and Barcelona 5-day preference, and reduces Helsinki to 3 days to fit the 14-day limit (this allocation matches the instantiated problem’s allocation). 

Total reported plan cost: 13.
