- Barcelona: days 4–8 (5 days total)
- Florence: days 9–14 (6 days total)

Notes on constraints and trade-offs
- The mandatory meeting in Florence is scheduled within day 9–14 (Florence visit covers days 9 through 14), so the meeting constraint is satisfied.
- Agents requested stays: Florence 6 days, Barcelona 5 days, Helsinki 5 days; total requested = 16 > available 14 days. The plan honors the Florence 6-day requirement and Barcelona 5-day preference, and reduces Helsinki to 3 days to fit the 14-day limit (this allocation matches the instantiated problem’s allocation). 

Total reported plan cost: 13.
