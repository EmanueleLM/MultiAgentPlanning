Plan (step-by-step, matching each PDDL action exactly). Timestamps expressed as "Day X" when assigning that day; flights are instantaneous actions between the day assignments they separate.

1) Action: assign-first scheduler_agent transport_agent d1 lyon c0 c1
   - Time: Day 1 (d1)
   - What happens: The scheduler_agent assigns Day 1 to Lyon.
   - Preconditions satisfied: transport_agent is at Lyon; Day 1 was unassigned; days-used increments from c0 to c1.
   - Effects: Day 1 is now assigned to Lyon. Symbolic days-used advanced from c0 -> c1.

2) Action: assign-next scheduler_agent transport_agent d1 d2 lyon lyon c1 c2
   - Time: Day 2 (d2), assigned using the ordering next(d1,d2)
   - What happens: The scheduler_agent assigns Day 2 to Lyon (continuing stay in same city).
   - Preconditions satisfied: Day 1 already assigned to Lyon; Lyon is connected to Lyon (self-connection); transport_agent is at Lyon; days-used c1 -> c2.
   - Effects: Day 2 is assigned to Lyon. Symbolic days-used advanced from c1 -> c2.

3) Action: assign-next scheduler_agent transport_agent d2 d3 lyon lyon c2 c3
   - Time: Day 3 (d3)
   - What happens: The scheduler_agent assigns Day 3 to Lyon (stay continues).
   - Effects: Day 3 assigned to Lyon. days-used advanced from c2 -> c3.

4) Action: assign-next scheduler_agent transport_agent d3 d4 lyon lyon c3 c4
   - Time: Day 4 (d4)
   - What happens: The scheduler_agent assigns Day 4 to Lyon.
   - Effects: Day 4 assigned to Lyon. days-used advanced from c3 -> c4.

5) Action: assign-next scheduler_agent transport_agent d4 d5 lyon lyon c4 c5
   - Time: Day 5 (d5)
   - What happens: The scheduler_agent assigns Day 5 to Lyon.
   - Effects: Day 5 assigned to Lyon. days-used advanced from c4 -> c5.

6) Action: fly transport_agent lyon frankfurt
   - Time: Instantaneous, occurs after Day 5 assignment and before Day 6 assignment
   - What happens: The transport_agent takes a direct flight from Lyon to Frankfurt.
   - Preconditions satisfied: transport_agent was at Lyon; direct-flight(l y o n, frankfurt) exists.
   - Effects: transport_agent is now at Frankfurt (no longer at Lyon).

7) Action: assign-next scheduler_agent transport_agent d5 d6 lyon frankfurt c5 c6
   - Time: Day 6 (d6)
   - What happens: The scheduler_agent assigns Day 6 to Frankfurt.
   - Preconditions satisfied: Day 5 assigned to Lyon; Lyon is connected to Frankfurt (direct flight); transport_agent is at Frankfurt; days-used c5 -> c6.
   - Effects: Day 6 assigned to Frankfurt. days-used advanced from c5 -> c6.

8) Action: assign-next scheduler_agent transport_agent d6 d7 frankfurt frankfurt c6 c7
   - Time: Day 7 (d7)
   - What happens: The scheduler_agent assigns Day 7 to Frankfurt (stay continues).
   - Effects: Day 7 assigned to Frankfurt. days-used advanced from c6 -> c7.

9) Action: fly transport_agent frankfurt krakow
   - Time: Instantaneous, occurs after Day 7 assignment and before Day 8 assignment
   - What happens: The transport_agent takes a direct flight from Frankfurt to Krakow.
   - Preconditions satisfied: transport_agent was at Frankfurt; direct-flight(frankfurt, krakow) exists.
   - Effects: transport_agent is now at Krakow (no longer at Frankfurt).

10) Action: assign-next scheduler_agent transport_agent d7 d8 frankfurt krakow c7 c8
    - Time: Day 8 (d8)
    - What happens: The scheduler_agent assigns Day 8 to Krakow.
    - Preconditions satisfied: Day 7 assigned to Frankfurt; Frankfurt is connected to Krakow; transport_agent is at Krakow; days-used c7 -> c8.
    - Effects: Day 8 assigned to Krakow. days-used advanced from c7 -> c8.

11) Action: assign-next scheduler_agent transport_agent d8 d9 krakow krakow c8 c9
    - Time: Day 9 (d9)
    - What happens: The scheduler_agent assigns Day 9 to Krakow (stay continues).
    - Effects: Day 9 assigned to Krakow. days-used advanced from c8 -> c9.

12) Action: assign-next scheduler_agent transport_agent d9 d10 krakow krakow c9 c10
    - Time: Day 10 (d10)
    - What happens: The scheduler_agent assigns Day 10 to Krakow (final day).
    - Effects: Day 10 assigned to Krakow. days-used advanced from c9 -> c10.

Final status after step 12:
- Day assignments:
  - Days 1–5: Lyon
  - Days 6–7: Frankfurt
  - Days 8–10: Krakow
- Symbolic days-used = c10 (all 10 days consumed)
- transport_agent location: Krakow
- Plan cost (as reported): 12 (unit cost)

This sequence exactly follows the provided PDDL plan and achieves the final goal: a 10-day trip using only direct flights, ending in Krakow with the day assignments listed above.
