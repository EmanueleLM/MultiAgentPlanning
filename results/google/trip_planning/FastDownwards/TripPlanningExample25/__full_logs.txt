PROBLEM
------------------------------
You plan to visit 3 European cities for 11 days in total. You only take direct flights to commute between cities. You plan to stay in Venice for 6 days. You would like to visit Dubrovnik for 4 days. You would like to visit Istanbul for 3 days.

Here are the cities that have direct flights:
from Dubrovnik to Istanbul, Istanbul and Venice.

Find a trip plan of visiting the cities for 11 days by taking direct flights to commute between them.

NATURAL-PLAN sas_plan_2
------------------------------
Summary: 11-day trip visiting Dubrovnik, Istanbul, Venice. Stays count as whole days; flights are travel steps between days. The sequence below exactly matches the given plan (same actions and order). Days are assigned to stay actions; flights occur between days.

1. Day 1 — stay (dub4) in Dubrovnik. (Action: stay dub4 dubrovnik)  
2. Day 2 — stay (dub3) in Dubrovnik. (Action: stay dub3 dubrovnik)  
3. Day 3 — stay (dub2) in Dubrovnik. (Action: stay dub2 dubrovnik)  
4. Day 4 — stay (dub1) in Dubrovnik. (Action: stay dub1 dubrovnik)  
5. Between Day 4 and Day 5 — fly from Dubrovnik to Istanbul. (Action: fly dubrovnik istanbul)  
6. Day 5 — stay (ist1) in Istanbul. (Action: stay ist1 istanbul)  
7. Between Day 5 and Day 6 — fly from Istanbul to Venice. (Action: fly istanbul venice)  
8. Day 6 — stay (ven6) in Venice. (Action: stay ven6 venice)  
9. Day 7 — stay (ven5) in Venice. (Action: stay ven5 venice)  
10. Day 8 — stay (ven4) in Venice. (Action: stay ven4 venice)  
11. Day 9 — stay (ven3) in Venice. (Action: stay ven3 venice)  
12. Day 10 — stay (ven2) in Venice. (Action: stay ven2 venice)  
13. Day 11 — stay (ven1) in Venice. (Action: stay ven1 venice)

Final allocation: Dubrovnik 4 days, Istanbul 1 day, Venice 6 days = 11 days total. Flights used: Dubrovnik → Istanbul, Istanbul → Venice (both direct as required). This sequence visits all three cities and uses exactly 11 stay-days as specified.

PROBLEM
------------------------------
You plan to visit 3 European cities for 12 days in total. You only take direct flights to commute between cities. You would like to visit Istanbul for 5 days. You would like to visit Budapest for 6 days. You would like to visit Dubrovnik for 3 days.

Here are the cities that have direct flights:
Istanbul and Budapest, from Dubrovnik to Istanbul.

Find a trip plan of visiting the cities for 12 days by taking direct flights to commute between them.

Validate and, if necessary, adjust the agents' proposed arrival and departure days to ensure a single 16-day itinerary that uses only direct flights between consecutive cities, satisfies each city's stay-length requirement, and ensures presence in Split for days 10 through 16. After integrating, produce a PDDL domain and PDDL problem that models days as discrete time steps, cities as locations, flights as actions constrained by direct connections, and a goal that the traveler visits each city for the required number of days and attends the Split show.
