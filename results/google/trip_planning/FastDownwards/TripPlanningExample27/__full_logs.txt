PROBLEM
------------------------------
You plan to visit 3 European cities for 14 days in total. You only take direct flights to commute between cities. You would like to visit Santorini for 3 days. You plan to visit relatives in Santorini between day 12 and day 14. You plan to stay in Amsterdam for 7 days. You would like to visit Istanbul for 6 days.

Here are the cities that have direct flights:
Amsterdam and Santorini, Istanbul and Amsterdam.

Find a trip plan of visiting the cities for 14 days by taking direct flights to commute between them.
