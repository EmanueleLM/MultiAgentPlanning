  - Venice: days 0,1,2,3,4,5 (6 days)
  - Zurich: days 6,7 (2 days)
  - Florence: days 8,9,10,11 (4 days)
- Total days allocated: 6 + 2 + 4 = 12 days (days 0..11 spent; current-day ends at day12).
- All flights used are direct: Venice → Zurich and Zurich → Florence (both present in the environment).
- The sequence matches the provided PDDL plan exactly and achieves the stated goal (current day = day12 and each required day-at facts established).
