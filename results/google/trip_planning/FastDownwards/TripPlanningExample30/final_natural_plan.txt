Summary of plan (TripPlanningExample30)

- Plan contains 0 actions (no moves or stays).
- Reason: The goal in the PDDL problem is simply (start-day d1). This fact is true in the initial state, so the planner requires no actions to achieve the goal.

Current timestamp / relevant time:
- Start day: d1 (day 1)

Result (human-readable):
- No itinerary changes or flight actions are executed. The initial state already satisfies the planner's goal (start on day 1), so no steps are required.
