NATURAL-PLAN sas_plan_2
------------------------------
1. (start-valencia d1)
   - Begin the trip in Valencia on day 1. You are at Valencia and day 1 is occupied.

2. (stay-valencia d1 d2)
   - Continue staying in Valencia: carry over from day 1 to day 2. You are at Valencia on day 2.

3. (stay-valencia d2 d3)
   - Stay in Valencia from day 2 to day 3. You are at Valencia on day 3.

4. (stay-valencia d3 d4)
   - Stay in Valencia from day 3 to day 4. You are at Valencia on day 4.

5. (stay-valencia d4 d5)
   - Stay in Valencia from day 4 to day 5. You are at Valencia on day 5.
   - This completes the 5-day Valencia stay (days 1–5).

6. (fly-valencia-to-amsterdam d5 d6)
   - Fly from Valencia to Amsterdam between day 5 and day 6, arriving in Amsterdam on day 6. You are at Amsterdam on day 6.

7. (stay-amsterdam d6 d7)
   - Stay in Amsterdam from day 6 to day 7. You are at Amsterdam on day 7.

8. (stay-amsterdam d7 d8)
   - Stay in Amsterdam from day 7 to day 8. You are at Amsterdam on day 8.
   - This completes the 3-day Amsterdam occupancy present in the plan (days 6–8).

9. (fly-amsterdam-to-tallinn d8 d9)
   - Fly from Amsterdam to Tallinn between day 8 and day 9, arriving in Tallinn on day 9. You are at Tallinn on day 9.

10. (stay-tallinn d9 d10)
    - Stay in Tallinn from day 9 to day 10. You are at Tallinn on day 10.

11. (stay-tallinn d10 d11)
    - Stay in Tallinn from day 10 to day 11. You are at Tallinn on day 11.

12. (stay-tallinn d11 d12)

15. (stay-tallinn d14 d15)
    - Stay in Tallinn from day 14 to day 15. You are at Tallinn on day 15.
    - This yields a Tallinn occupancy from day 9 through day 15 (inclusive), satisfying the meeting constraint (a day between day 9 and day 15 is included).

Summary:
- The plan follows exactly the given actions in order.
- City-by-day occupancy: Valencia days 1–5, Amsterdam days 6–8, Tallinn days 9–15.
- All flights use direct connections (Valencia ↔ Amsterdam, Amsterdam ↔ Tallinn).
- The Tallinn meeting-window constraint (a day in 9..15) is satisfied. Total trip covers days 1–15.

Keep movement actions and stay actions clearly distinguishable. Enclose the PDDL domain between <domain></domain> tags and the PDDL problem between <problem></problem> tags.

You plan to visit 3 European cities for 11 days in total. You only take direct flights to commute between cities. You would like to visit Berlin for 6 days. You plan to stay in Porto for 2 days. You are going to attend a wedding in Porto between day 10 and day 11. You plan to stay in Krakow for 5 days.

Here are the cities that have direct flights:
Berlin and Porto, Krakow and Berlin.

Find a trip plan of visiting the cities for 11 days by taking direct flights to commute between them.

PROBLEM
------------------------------
(define (problem travel-problem)
  (:domain travel-domain)

  ;; Assumptions and resolution of inconsistency (documented as comments):
  ;;; ASSUMPTIONS MADE TO RESOLVE INPUT INCONSISTENCIES:
  ;;; 1) The traveler's requested stay durations sum to 13 days (Berlin 6 + Porto 2 + Krakow 5 = 13).
  ;;;    This conflicts with the provided "Total trip duration is 11 days". To produce a feasible plan
  ;;;    that respects the traveler's hard constraints (stay durations and wedding attendance), I assume
  ;;;    the total trip duration must be 13 days. Therefore days are numbered day1..day13.
  ;;; 2) To allow reaching Porto on the required wedding day while respecting only-direct-flights
  ;;;    (where Krakow and Porto have no direct connection), I allow chaining multiple direct flight legs
  ;;;    within the same calendar day (e.g., Krakow -> Berlin -> Porto within one day) by using the
  ;;;    fly_same_day_traveler action that permits multiple direct legs per day. Each leg used is a direct flight,
  ;;;    so the "direct flights only" constraint is preserved per leg.
  ;;; 3) I assume the traveler starts the trip in Berlin on day1 (earliest feasible start) to follow the
  ;;;    instruction to prefer the earliest feasible schedule.
  ;;; These assumptions are necessary because the provided constraints are otherwise unsatisfiable.
  ;;; They are encoded above and should be reviewed.

5) Day 4 -> Day 5 — stay_amsterdam_5_day4
   - Remain in Amsterdam for 1 day (consumes day4; time advances to day5).
   - At this point: Amsterdam stay complete (5 days total in Amsterdam).

6) Day 5 (instantaneous) — fly_amsterdam_to_vilnius
   - Take a direct flight from Amsterdam to Vilnius on day5 (flight does not consume an extra modeled “day” in this plan).

7) Day 5 -> Day 6 — stay_vilnius_1_day5
   - Remain in Vilnius for 1 day (consumes day5; time advances to day6).

8) Day 6 -> Day 7 — stay_vilnius_2_day6
   - Remain in Vilnius for 1 day (consumes day6; time advances to day7).
   - At this point: Vilnius stay complete (2 days total in Vilnius).

9) Day 7 (instantaneous) — fly_vilnius_to_amsterdam
   - Take a direct flight from Vilnius back to Amsterdam on day7 (instant in model).

10) Day 7 (instantaneous) — fly_amsterdam_to_bucharest
    - Immediately take a direct flight from Amsterdam to Bucharest on day7 (instant in model).

11) Day 7 -> Day 8 — stay_bucharest_1_day7
    - Remain in Bucharest for 1 day (consumes day7; time advances to day8).

12) Day 8 -> Day 9 — stay_bucharest_2_day8
    - Remain in Bucharest for 1 day (consumes day8; time advances to day9).

13) Day 9 -> Day 10 — stay_bucharest_3_day9
    - Remain in Bucharest for 1 day (consumes day9; time advances to day10).

14) Day 10 -> Day 11 — stay_bucharest_4_day10
    - Remain in Bucharest for 1 day (consumes day10; time advances to day11).
    - At this point: Bucharest stays recorded for 4 days (days 7–11 start).

15) Day 11 (instantaneous) — meet_friends_in_bucharest_day11
    - Meet friends in Bucharest on day11 (meeting requirement satisfied between day6 and day11).

Summary: This sequence follows the provided plan exactly. Day-by-day accounting:
- Amsterdam: 5 days (days 0–5)
- Vilnius: 2 days (days 5–7)
- Bucharest: 4 days (days 7–11)
- Meeting with friends occurs on day 11 (within the required window day6–day11)
- Final model time state: at-day day11 and meeting completed.

  (:documentation
   "Assumptons and modelling notes:
    - Days are discrete and numbered 1..13. The initial state starts at day=1.
    - The plan model uses an 'advance' action that sets the city for the next day and increments counters.
    - The initial day (day 1) is counted already toward the initial city's spent-<city> counter.
    - Flights/transitions are only allowed when a 'connected' relation exists between cities.
    - Self-connections represent staying in the same city for the next day (no separate 'stay' action needed).
    - The model assumes flights/transitions happen between day t and day t+1 and do not consume additional fractional time beyond advancing the day.
    - The integrated plan chooses the earliest feasible schedule satisfying hard constraints: Florence days 1-4, Amsterdam days 5-9, Riga days 10-13.
    - Minimal negotiated adjustments: Amsterdam reduced to 5 days and Riga reduced to 4 days to respect the 13-day total while keeping Florence fixed at 4 days (to meet the workshop constraint).
    - This domain uses numeric fluents (PDDL 2.1 style) and conditional effects; FastDownward supports these constructs."

PROBLEM
------------------------------
You plan to visit 3 European cities for 10 days in total. You only take direct flights to commute between cities. You want to spend 2 days in Krakow. You are going to attend a wedding in Krakow between day 9 and day 10. You plan to stay in Dubrovnik for 7 days. You would like to visit Frankfurt for 3 days.

Here are the cities that have direct flights:
Frankfurt and Krakow, Dubrovnik and Frankfurt.

Find a trip plan of visiting the cities for 10 days by taking direct flights to commute between them.

ENVIRONMENT
------------------------------
You plan to visit 3 European cities for 10 days in total. You only take direct flights to commute between cities. You want to spend 2 days in Krakow. You are going to attend a wedding in Krakow between day 9 and day 10. You plan to stay in Dubrovnik for 7 days. You would like to visit Frankfurt for 3 days.

Here are the cities that have direct flights:
Frankfurt and Krakow, Dubrovnik and Frankfurt.

Find a trip plan of visiting the cities for 10 days by taking direct flights to commute between them.
================================================================================


FINAL-PLAN
------------------------------
Summary and chosen itinerary (conflict resolution)
- Conflict: requested stays sum to 12 days (Dubrovnik 7 + Frankfurt 3 + Krakow 2) but total trip length is 10 days.
- Resolution chosen (minimal change, respects direct-flight connectivity and wedding):
  - Shorten Frankfurt stay from 3 days → 1 day.
  - Itinerary (earliest feasible schedule consistent with constraints and direct flights):
    - Days 1–7: Dubrovnik
    - Day 8: Frankfurt
    - Days 9–10: Krakow (wedding between day 9 and day 10 satisfied; present in Krakow on both days)
  - Travel legs (direct flights only):
    - Fly Dubrovnik -> Frankfurt between day 7 and day 8 (direct flight exists)
    - Fly Frankfurt -> Krakow between day 8 and day 9 (direct flight exists)
- This itinerary meets:
  - Total = 10 days
  - Dubrovnik 7 days, Krakow 2 days, Frankfurt 1 day
  - Wedding presence in Krakow during the day9–day10 window
  - Uses only provided direct flight connections

Below are the FastDownward-compatible PDDL domain and problem files encoding the multi-day itinerary model.
Notes on modeling choices (encoded in PDDL):
- Discrete days modeled as objects day1..day10, with a next(day_i day_{i+1}) relation.
- Predicate (at ?city ?day) indicates presence in a city on that day.
- Predicate (free ?day) indicates the day has not yet been assigned a city; actions require the next day to be free and then occupy it (ensures exactly one city per day).
- Two traveler-specific actions are provided:
  - traveler-stay: remain in the same city for the next day
  - traveler-fly: move to a directly connected city for the next day (requires a flightexists fact)
- Direct flights are only those explicitly declared in the initial state.

NATURAL-PLAN sas_plan_0
------------------------------
1) Stay in Dubrovnik — day1 → day2
   - Remain in Dubrovnik from Day 1 through Day 2 (covers Day 1 → Day 2).

2) Stay in Dubrovnik — day2 → day3
   - Remain in Dubrovnik from Day 2 through Day 3 (covers Day 2 → Day 3).

3) Stay in Dubrovnik — day3 → day4
   - Remain in Dubrovnik from Day 3 through Day 4 (covers Day 3 → Day 4).

4) Stay in Dubrovnik — day4 → day5
   - Remain in Dubrovnik from Day 4 through Day 5 (covers Day 4 → Day 5).

5) Stay in Dubrovnik — day5 → day6
   - Remain in Dubrovnik from Day 5 through Day 6 (covers Day 5 → Day 6).

6) Stay in Dubrovnik — day6 → day7
   - Remain in Dubrovnik from Day 6 through Day 7 (covers Day 6 → Day 7).

7) Fly Dubrovnik → Frankfurt — day7 → day8
   - Take a direct flight from Dubrovnik on Day 7 to arrive in Frankfurt on Day 8 (covers the travel between Day 7 and Day 8).

8) Fly Frankfurt → Krakow — day8 → day9
   - Take a direct flight from Frankfurt on Day 8 to arrive in Krakow on Day 9 (covers the travel between Day 8 and Day 9).

9) Stay in Krakow — day9 → day10
   - Remain in Krakow from Day 9 through Day 10 (covers Day 9 → Day 10).

Summary / final state:
- Dubrovnik: Days 1,2,3,4,5,6,7 (7 days)
- Frankfurt: Day 8 (1 day)
- Krakow: Days 9,10 (2 days)

This itinerary satisfies the wedding constraint (present in Krakow during the Day 9 → Day 10 window) and fits the 10-day total. Note: the traveler's original per-city requests (Krakow 2, Dubrovnik 7, Frankfurt 3 = 12 days) conflicted with the 10-day total; the plan resolves this by reducing the stay in Frankfurt to 1 day.

Find a trip plan of visiting the cities for 14 days by taking direct flights to commute between them.
================================================================================


FINAL-PLAN
------------------------------
I don’t yet have the traveler’s itinerary or the flight planner’s direct-flight sequences in this conversation. I can’t invent availability or dates—so I need those inputs to generate a correct FastDownwards-compatible PDDL domain and problem.

Please provide the following (explicitly and exactly) so I can produce the integrated PDDL files:

1) Days / timeline
- Number or list of discrete days (e.g., Day1 Day2 ... Day7). If you prefer calendar dates, give them and I will map them to day identifiers.
- If there are time-of-day constraints (morning/afternoon/evening) state them and whether flights can occur within a day or only between days.

2) Cities
- A list of city names used by the traveler and the flight planner (ensure consistent names; I will normalize case and hyphens if you indicate).

3) Traveler’s day-by-day itinerary (the traveler’s constraints)
- For each day, specify either:
  - a fixed stay in a city (e.g., Day3: Zurich), or
  - a constraint like "must be in CityX for N consecutive days starting no earlier than DayY", or
  - "available/free" (meaning no fixed city).
- Any strict constraints (these will be encoded as hard constraints) such as "must be in Zurich on Day4 for the show" — give exact day.

4) Flight planner’s direct-flight sequences / availability (the planner’s constraints)
- A list of direct-flight facts of the form (from-city, to-city) and the days they are available, e.g.:
  - Flight: CityA -> CityB available Day2
  - Or if a direct flight is available every day in the timeline, say so.
- If flights are directional or bidirectional, state that explicitly.
- If multi-leg connections are given as sequences (e.g., A->B, B->C), provide them as direct edges; I will not invent intermediate connections.

5) Initial state
- The traveler's starting city and starting day (e.g., Day1 at CityA).

6) Goals / optimization rules
- The primary goal: e.g., satisfy the traveler's itinerary and arrive at some final city by final day.
- If there are multiple possible valid schedules, you asked to "Prioritise the earliest time that respects every constraint" — treating earliest as a hard constraint means: if the traveler specified earliest allowable days, include them; otherwise please confirm whether you want an additional minimization objective (FastDownward supports optimal search with metric but keep in mind you asked to treat preferences as hard constraints). If you want me to encode minimizing number of flight-days, say so.

7) Any additional constraints
- e.g., “At most one flight per day”, “cannot visit more than one city on a single day”, minimum stay durations, or “show constraint in Zurich requires being in Zurich on DayX and not flying that day”.

Format suggestion (copy-paste friendly):
- Days: Day1 Day2 Day3 Day4
- Cities: Zurich Paris Rome London
- Traveler itinerary:
  - Day1: London
  - Day2: free
  - Day3: Zurich (must attend show)
  - Day4: Zurich (stay)
- Flights:
  - London -> Paris available Day1
  - Paris -> Zurich available Day2
  - London -> Zurich available Day2
  - (Specify directional/bidirectional)
- Initial: Day1 at London
- Goal: Be in Zurich on Day3; end anywhere on Day4 / be in Zurich Day4 / etc.

Once you provide these inputs I will:
- Normalize names and days.
- Build a PDDL domain modeling days as objects, predicates for (at ?person ?city ?day) and (flight ?from ?to ?day).
- Actions for staying in a city (carry forward at next day) and for flying (move from day d to d+1 if a flight exists that day, or within the same day if you specify).
- Encode the traveler's itinerary as hard constraints in the problem (initial state and goal facts).
- Encode flight planner availability as flight predicates in the initial state.
- Encode the Zurich show constraint as a hard requirement (must be in Zurich on that day and not flying that day).
- Produce the PDDL domain and problem enclosed in <domain></domain> and <problem></problem> tags compatible with FastDownwards.

Provide the itinerary and flight data and I’ll generate the complete PDDL domain and problem.

Here are the cities that have direct flights:

Find a trip plan of visiting the cities for 10 days by taking direct flights to commute between them.
================================================================================


FINAL-PLAN
------------------------------
Summary of stays, hard constraints, and acceptable flexibility

- Hard shared constraints
  - Total itinerary length: exactly 10 days (days d1..d10).
  - Only direct flights allowed. Direct connections available: Frankfurt <-> Reykjavik and Frankfurt <-> Split. There is no direct flight Reykjavik <-> Split.
  - The Reykjavik workshop is a hard constraint: Reykjavik must be visited on one of days d8, d9, or d10 (at least one of those days the traveler must be in Reykjavik). The traveler prefers the earliest feasible slot in that window (prefer day d8 if possible).
  - Flights consume one day (a flight occurs during the daytime and results in being in the destination city on the next day).
  - Daytime-travel preference treated as a hard temporal constraint: flights are allowed only when there is a "next day" (i.e., flights may be taken from d1..d9 and arrive the next day). This prevents scheduling flights on d10 (no next day).
  - Minimize flight legs is encoded as a hard upper bound on the number of flight legs: flight-count <= 3 (this keeps flight legs low and consistent with the hub requirement; it enforces the travel preference as a strict constraint).

- Starting-location assumption (declared): to minimize flight legs and because direct flights connect via Frankfurt, the model assumes the traveler starts in Frankfurt on day d1 (this assumption is explicit and used only to keep the model realizable given the flight network).

- Desired stays, firmness and allowed flexibility (to resolve the 2+3+7 = 12 > 10 inconsistency)
  - Frankfurt: desired 2 days. Flexibility: firm minimum 1 day, maximum 2 days. Preference: prefer 2 days if it fits.
  - Reykjavik: desired 3 days. Flexibility: firm minimum 1 day, maximum 3 days. Hard constraint: at least one of Reykjavik days must be on d8..d10 (workshop). Preference: prefer 3 days and prefer that one of those Reykjavik days be d8 (earliest possible).
  - Split: desired 7 days. Flexibility: firm minimum 1 day, maximum 7 days. Preference: prefer more days in Split up to 7, but constrained by total=10.
  - Total-days constraint: the sum of days spent across the three cities must equal 10; individual city days must respect their min/max bounds above.

- Feasible visit sequences given direct flights only (and given we start in Frankfurt)
  - With Frankfurt as hub, possible sequences that respect the no-direct-R<->S constraint:
    - F -> R -> F -> S  (two visits to Frankfurt, two flight round-trips; counts as 3 flights)
    - F -> S -> F -> R  (similar)
  - These sequences comply with direct-flight availability; visiting both Reykjavik and Split requires transiting through Frankfurt at least once.
  - With the flight-count <= 3 cap and the start-in-Frankfurt assumption the planner will pick one of the hub patterns above.

- Practical encoding choices for the PDDL model
  - Days d1..d10 are explicit objects and day progression is explicit via next(d_i,d_{i+1}).
  - The model uses numeric fluents to count days spent per city and to count flight legs (days-in frankfurt, days-in reykjavik, days-in split, flight-count).
  - Flights are only allowed on days that have a defined next day (d1..d9), enforcing the daytime-travel hard preference.
  - The Reykjavik workshop constraint is encoded as a requirement that (at reykjavik d8) or (at reykjavik d9) or (at reykjavik d10) must hold.
  - The solver is asked to produce a plan that satisfies all hard constraints (including the flight-count cap and the per-city min/max day bounds). The "earliest feasible" preference for Reykjavik (day d8) is expressed as preference in the summary; the PDDL requires at least one of d8..d10 — the solver will find a plan and, given the other hard constraints and the flight-count cap, should prefer schedules that hit the earliest feasible Reykjavik day (d8) when that fits.

Starting state: you are in Rome on day 1.

Planned actions (each action consumes one day, showing start -> end day and arrival day):

1. Stay in Rome from day 1 to day 2 (remain in Rome; present on day 2).  
2. Stay in Rome from day 2 to day 3 (remain in Rome; present on day 3).  
3. Fly from Rome to Barcelona between day 3 and day 4 (depart on day 3, arrive in Barcelona on day 4).  
4. Stay in Barcelona from day 4 to day 5 (remain in Barcelona; present on day 5).  
5. Stay in Barcelona from day 5 to day 6 (remain in Barcelona; present on day 6).  
6. Stay in Barcelona from day 6 to day 7 (remain in Barcelona; present on day 7).  
7. Stay in Barcelona from day 7 to day 8 (remain in Barcelona; present on day 8).  
8. Stay in Barcelona from day 8 to day 9 (remain in Barcelona; present on day 9).  
9. Fly from Barcelona to Krakow between day 9 and day 10 (depart on day 9, arrive in Krakow on day 10).  
10. Stay in Krakow from day 10 to day 11 (remain in Krakow; present on day 11).  
11. Stay in Krakow from day 11 to day 12 (remain in Krakow; present on day 12).  
12. Stay in Krakow from day 12 to day 13 (remain in Krakow; present on day 13).  

Result: Total itinerary spans days 1–13, with presence in Krakow on days 10–13 (meeting window satisfied).
