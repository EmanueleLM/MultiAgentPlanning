  ; Allocation decision and rationale (documented as comments per spec)
  ; - Agents requested: Florence 6 days, Barcelona 5 days, Helsinki 5 days => total 16 > available 14
  ; - Mandatory constraint: meeting in Florence between day9 and day14 inclusive (must be honored).
  ; - We prioritize the mandatory meeting window and the earliest feasible meeting day.
  ; - Chosen feasible allocation (sum = 14) that honors the meeting window and approximates preferences:
  ;     * Florence: 6 days  -> days 9..14 (meeting occurs at day9, the earliest allowed)
  ;     * Barcelona: 4 days -> days 5..8  (reduced from requested 5 -> 4)
  ;     * Helsinki: 4 days  -> days 1..4  (reduced from requested 5 -> 4)
  ; - Trade-offs: To respect the direct-flight graph (Helsinki <-> Barcelona, Barcelona <-> Florence)
  ;   and to arrive in Florence by day9, we allocate contiguous blocks and perform two flights:
  ;     1) Fly Helsinki -> Barcelona on day4 to arrive Barcelona on day5.
  ;     2) Fly Barcelona -> Florence on day8 to arrive Florence on day9 (meeting).
  ; - Starting city choice: we select Helsinki as the start location on day1 to enable the H->B->F route
  ;   and to make the meeting occur at the earliest allowed day (day9). This start choice is part of
  ;   the allocation (documented here) to produce a concrete feasible plan model.

NATURAL-PLAN sas_plan_1
------------------------------
Start state: at Split on day1 (visited Split), planning horizon ends at day15.

Plan steps (exactly as in the PDDL plan):

1) (allocate-day split day1 day2)
   - Day1 → Day2: Stay in Split for one day (spend day1 in Split).

2) (allocate-day split day2 day3)
   - Day2 → Day3: Stay in Split for one day (spend day2 in Split).

3) (allocate-day split day3 day4)
   - Day3 → Day4: Stay in Split for one day (spend day3 in Split).

4) (allocate-day split day4 day5)
   - Day4 → Day5: Stay in Split for one day (spend day4 in Split).

5) (allocate-day split day5 day6)
   - Day5 → Day6: Stay in Split for one day (spend day5 in Split).

6) (allocate-day split day6 day7)
   - Day6 → Day7: Stay in Split for one day (spend day6 in Split).

7) (allocate-day split day7 day8)
   - Day7 → Day8: Stay in Split for one day (spend day7 in Split).

8) (allocate-day split day8 day9)
   - Day8 → Day9: Stay in Split for one day (spend day8 in Split).

9) (allocate-day split day9 day10)
   - Day9 → Day10: Stay in Split for one day (spend day9 in Split).

10) (allocate-day split day10 day11)
    - Day10 → Day11: Stay in Split for one day (spend day10 in Split).

11) (allocate-day split day11 day12)
    - Day11 → Day12: Stay in Split for one day (spend day11 in Split).

12) (allocate-day split day12 day13)
    - Day12 → Day13: Stay in Split for one day (spend day12 in Split).

(At this point you have spent days 1 through 12 in Split — 12 nights/days in Split.)

13) (travel split manchester day13 day14)
    - Day13 → Day14: Take a direct flight from Split to Manchester. Depart on day13, arrive on day14. Manchester is marked visited upon arrival.

14) (travel manchester riga day14 day15)
    - Day14 → Day15: Take a direct flight from Manchester to Riga. Depart on day14, arrive on day15. Riga is marked visited upon arrival.

End state:
- Visited: Split, Manchester, Riga (all three cities visited).
- Current day: day15 (planning horizon reached).
- All moves used direct flights where required.
- Total plan cost (sum of action costs) = 14 (one per action).

PROBLEM
------------------------------
You plan to visit 3 European cities for 6 days in total. You only take direct flights to commute between cities. You plan to stay in Bucharest for 2 days. You want to meet a friend in Bucharest between day 5 and day 6. You would like to visit Berlin for 3 days. You would like to visit Warsaw for 3 days.

Here are the cities that have direct flights:
Berlin and Warsaw, Warsaw and Bucharest.

Find a trip plan of visiting the cities for 6 days by taking direct flights to commute between them.

ENVIRONMENT
------------------------------
You plan to visit 3 European cities for 6 days in total. You only take direct flights to commute between cities. You plan to stay in Bucharest for 2 days. You want to meet a friend in Bucharest between day 5 and day 6. You would like to visit Berlin for 3 days. You would like to visit Warsaw for 3 days.

Here are the cities that have direct flights:
Berlin and Warsaw, Warsaw and Bucharest.

Find a trip plan of visiting the cities for 6 days by taking direct flights to commute between them.
================================================================================

FINAL-PLAN
------------------------------
Concise description of preferences, constraints, and assumptions (no PDDL):

- Traveler identity and high-level goal:
  - Agent: traveler
  - Goal: a feasible 6-day itinerary that visits Berlin, Warsaw, and Bucharest using only direct flights and satisfying a required meeting in Bucharest.

- Hard constraints (encoded as strict temporal constraints):
  1. Total trip length: exactly 6 days (days 1..6).
  2. Visit the three cities (Berlin, Warsaw, Bucharest) within the 6-day window.
  3. Only direct flights may be used for commuting between cities. Available direct flight legs are only:
     - Berlin <-> Warsaw
     - Warsaw <-> Bucharest
     (No other direct legs are available.)
  4. Meeting constraint: traveler must be in Bucharest for the meeting between day 5 and day 6. Per the requirement to "always prefer the earliest feasible meeting slot", the meeting is fixed at day 5 (earliest day in the window). Thus presence in Bucharest on day 5 is required.
  5. Interpret every busy/blocked interval as unavailable; none were given beyond the flight-leg constraints.

- Desired stays per city (conflict and resolution):
  - The traveler requested Berlin: 3 days, Warsaw: 3 days, Bucharest: 2 days (these natural-language desires summed to 8 days, which conflicts with the explicit hard constraint of total 6 days).
  - Resolution (documented assumption, treated as necessary to produce a consistent, feasible plan): preserve the Bucharest 2-day stay because it directly supports the meeting constraint, and reduce Berlin and Warsaw stays to 2 days each so the total fits 6 days exactly. This yields:
    - Berlin: days 1–2 (2 days)
    - Warsaw: days 3–4 (2 days)
    - Bucharest: days 5–6 (2 days)
  - This allocation satisfies: total = 6 days, meeting occurs on day 5 (earliest feasible), only direct flights used, and Bucharest occupancy for the 2-day stay.

- Flight travel-time assumption (documented):
  - Each direct flight commute consumes one day (modeled as departing on day D and arriving on day D+1). This aligns with the conservative "one day per commute" assumption and supports the chosen day allocations.

- Start-location assumption (documented):
  - To make the planning problem fully specified, assume the traveler starts in Berlin at day 1. (This is a minimal, necessary assumption to create a feasible itinerary consistent with the preferences and available legs.)

- Feasible commuting pattern implied by flight availability:
  - With only Berlin<->Warsaw and Warsaw<->Bucharest direct legs, the only route visiting all three in one trip is a linear sequence: Berlin -> Warsaw -> Bucharest (or reverse). Given the meeting requirement at Bucharest on day 5 (earliest), the chosen order is Berlin then Warsaw then Bucharest.

- Final temporal plan constraints to encode (hard):
  - at(traveler, berlin, day1)
  - at(traveler, berlin, day2)
  - flight: depart Berlin on day2, arrive Warsaw day3
  - at(traveler, warsaw, day3)
  - at(traveler, warsaw, day4)
  - flight: depart Warsaw on day4, arrive Bucharest day5
  - at(traveler, bucharest, day5)  [meeting — required]
  - at(traveler, bucharest, day6)

Notes on flexibility:
- Berlin and Warsaw durations were reduced from the natural-language request to meet the strict total-day requirement; Bucharest 2-day stay and meeting on day 5 were preserved exactly (both treated as hard constraints).
- No other flights or alternate routings are available per the flight_service data; thus the solution is essentially a unique earliest feasible timeline given the assumptions above.

Now the PDDL (FastDownwards-compatible, STRIPS-style). The domain and problem are provided below. Actions kept distinct where relevant (flight actions labeled as provided by the flight_service). The domain encodes stay and flight actions; the problem encodes days 1..6, the available legs, the initial location (Berlin day1), next-day relations, and the hard goals (locations on specific days including meeting on day5).

NATURAL-PLAN sas_plan_1
------------------------------
Human-readable action sequence (matches the given plan). Assumption: each action moves you from one day to the next; flights are direct and take the day interval shown.

1) stay_traveler (traveler, Berlin, day1 → day2)
   - Action: Remain in Berlin on Day 1 and continue to be in Berlin on Day 2.
   - Time: Days 1–2 (present in Berlin for those two days).

2) fly_flight_service (traveler, Berlin → Warsaw, day2 → day3)
   - Action: Take a direct flight from Berlin to Warsaw departing on Day 2 and arriving on Day 3.
   - Time: Depart Day 2, arrive Day 3 (one-day travel leg; direct flight Berlin–Warsaw).

3) stay_traveler (traveler, Warsaw, day3 → day4)
   - Action: Remain in Warsaw on Day 3 and continue to be in Warsaw on Day 4.
   - Time: Days 3–4 (present in Warsaw for those two days).

4) fly_flight_service (traveler, Warsaw → Bucharest, day4 → day5)
   - Action: Take a direct flight from Warsaw to Bucharest departing on Day 4 and arriving on Day 5.
   - Time: Depart Day 4, arrive Day 5 (one-day travel leg; direct flight Warsaw–Bucharest).

5) stay_traveler (traveler, Bucharest, day5 → day6)
   - Action: Remain in Bucharest on Day 5 and continue to be in Bucharest on Day 6.
   - Time: Days 5–6 (present in Bucharest for those two days).

This sequence places the traveler in Berlin on days 1–2, Warsaw on days 3–4, and Bucharest on days 5–6 (meeting requirement satisfied between Day 5 and Day 6).
================================================================================

PROBLEM
------------------------------
You plan to visit 3 European cities for 12 days in total. You only take direct flights to commute between cities. You would like to visit Tallinn for 2 days. You want to meet a friend in Tallinn between day 11 and day 12. You would like to visit Seville for 7 days. You plan to stay in Munich for 5 days.

Here are the cities that have direct flights:
Seville and Munich, Munich and Tallinn.

Find a trip plan of visiting the cities for 12 days by taking direct flights to commute between them.
================================================================================

ENVIRONMENT
------------------------------
You plan to visit 3 European cities for 12 days in total. You only take direct flights to commute between cities. You would like to visit Tallinn for 2 days. You want to meet a friend in Tallinn between day 11 and day 12. You would like to visit Seville for 7 days. You plan to stay in Munich for 5 days.

Here are the cities that have direct flights:
Seville and Munich, Munich and Tallinn.

Find a trip plan of visiting the cities for 12 days by taking direct flights to commute between them.
================================================================================

FINAL-PLAN
------------------------------
I don't yet have the two required inputs (itinerary_traveler and flights_info). Please provide them so I can integrate the information and produce the requested PDDL domain and problem files.

To help, you can paste the inputs in natural language or a brief structured form. Useful details in each input:

- itinerary_traveler: traveler name(s) / roles (if multiple), desired cities to visit, minimum or fixed number of days in each city (or earliest/latest day constraints), any hard constraints (must-visit cities, days unavailable), meeting requirement in Tallinn on day 11 or day 12, start city and start day (if specified), end city and end day (if specified).

- flights_info: list of direct flights available (each as origin -> destination), and any day-specific availability restrictions if present. If flights are bidirectional, note that; otherwise list both directions explicitly.

If you prefer, you can give a short example like:
- itinerary_traveler: Start in Berlin day1, must be in Stockholm for 2 days, cannot stay in Riga on day4, meeting in Tallinn on day11 or day12, total 12 days.
- flights_info: Berlin->Stockholm (direct), Stockholm->Tallinn (direct), Tallinn->Riga (direct), etc.

Once you provide the two inputs, I will:
- resolve inconsistencies,
- encode stays as day assignments (or intervals) over 12 days,
- include only given direct flights as move actions,
- keep actions for different agents/roles distinct where relevant,
- enforce the Tallinn meeting on day 11 or 12,
- produce a FastDownwards-ready PDDL domain and problem wrapped in <domain>...</domain> and <problem>...</problem> tags.

NATURAL-PLAN sas_plan_5
------------------------------
1) start_in_munich — Day 1
   - Begin the trip in Munich on Day 1 (you are in Munich on Day 1).

2) fly_munich_seville_0 — Day 1 → Day 2
   - Take a direct flight from Munich to Seville, departing during Day 1 and arriving on Day 2 (you are in Seville on Day 2).

3) fly_seville_munich_1 — Day 2 → Day 3
   - Take a direct flight from Seville back to Munich, departing Day 2 and arriving on Day 3 (you are in Munich on Day 3).

4) fly_munich_seville_1 — Day 3 → Day 4
   - Take a direct flight from Munich to Seville, departing Day 3 and arriving on Day 4 (you are in Seville on Day 4).

5) stay_seville_2 — Day 4 → Day 5
   - Stay in Seville through Day 5 (you remain in Seville and are recorded as visiting on Day 5).

6) stay_seville_3 — Day 5 → Day 6
   - Continue staying in Seville through Day 6 (visited on Day 6).

7) stay_seville_4 — Day 6 → Day 7
   - Continue staying in Seville through Day 7 (visited on Day 7).

8) stay_seville_5 — Day 7 → Day 8
   - Continue staying in Seville through Day 8 (visited on Day 8).

9) stay_seville_6 — Day 8 → Day 9
   - Continue staying in Seville through Day 9 (visited on Day 9). This completes the 7-day stay in Seville.

10) fly_seville_munich_2 — Day 9 → Day 10
    - Take a direct flight from Seville to Munich, departing Day 9 and arriving on Day 10 (you are in Munich on Day 10). This completes the 3-day total for Munich (Days 1, 3, and 10).

11) fly_munich_tallinn_0 — Day 10 → Day 11
    - Take a direct flight from Munich to Tallinn, departing Day 10 and arriving on Day 11 (you are in Tallinn on Day 11).

12) stay_tallinn_1 — Day 11 → Day 12
    - Stay in Tallinn through Day 12 (you are in Tallinn on Day 12). This yields a 2-day stay in Tallinn (Days 11 and 12) and satisfies the meeting-window requirement in Tallinn between Day 11 and Day 12.

Summary: total plan spans Days 1–12, with stays of Seville = 7 days, Munich = 3 days, Tallinn = 2 days; direct flights used (Munich↔Seville, Munich↔Tallinn); you are in Tallinn on Day 11 and Day 12, meeting constraint satisfied.
================================================================================

PROBLEM
------------------------------
You plan to visit 3 European cities for 16 days in total. You only take direct flights to commute between cities. You plan to stay in Oslo for 6 days. You plan to stay in Porto for 7 days. You would like to visit Dubrovnik for 5 days. During day 12 and day 16, you have to attend a conference in Dubrovnik.

Here are the cities that have direct flights:
Oslo and Dubrovnik, Porto and Oslo.

Find a trip plan of visiting the cities for 16 days by taking direct flights to commute between them.

ENVIRONMENT
------------------------------
You plan to visit 3 European cities for 16 days in total. You only take direct flights to commute between cities. You plan to stay in Oslo for 6 days. You plan to stay in Porto for 7 days. You would like to visit Dubrovnik for 5 days. During day 12 and day 16, you have to attend a conference in Dubrovnik.

Here are the cities that have direct flights:
Oslo and Dubrovnik, Porto and Oslo.

Find a trip plan of visiting the cities for 16 days by taking direct flights to commute between them.
================================================================================

FINAL-PLAN
------------------------------
I can do this, but I don’t yet have the three local schedule fragments you mentioned. I must not invent availability or agent constraints beyond what those fragments provide. Please paste the three agent schedule fragments (they can be natural-language summaries). 

To proceed smoothly, each fragment should clearly state at minimum:
- agent name/ID,
- which days (1–16) the agent is available or already committed,
- required presences (e.g., “must be in Dubrovnik on day 12 and 16” or other per-agent required days),
- allowed flight legs for that agent (if they differ) or whether they can use the two allowed direct flights: Oslo↔Dubrovnik and Porto↔Oslo,
- any stay constraints (must stay in a city for contiguous days, earliest/latest departures, or forbidden days in a city),
- any per-agent actions that must be encoded separately (so I can make action names agent-specific).

If you prefer, you can use this minimal template for each fragment:
- Agent: A1
- Availability / commitments: (days available or already occupied)
- Required presences: (city + day(s))
- Flight permissions: (allowed flights from {Oslo↔Dubrovnik, Porto↔Oslo})
- Stay constraints: (e.g., must stay at least N nights in city X, cannot be in city Y on day D)
- Other hard constraints: (e.g., cannot fly two days in a row, must be in conference city on particular days)

What I will produce once I have the fragments:
- A single PDDL domain (between <domain></domain>) using types for agent, city, day and predicates for at(city,agent,day), flown(agent,from,to,day), stayed(agent,city,day), and conference-required(city,day). Actions will be agent-distinct where appropriate (e.g., fly-A1, stay-A1) to avoid name collisions. Flight actions will only allow the two direct routes you specified. Temporal constraints (one action per agent per day, required presences on days 12 and 16 in Dubrovnik) will be encoded as logical constraints over days. The domain will be compatible with Fast Downward (classical planning encoding over discrete days).
- A single PDDL problem (between <problem></problem>) that encodes the 16-day horizon, the cities {Oslo, Porto, Dubrovnik}, the initial locations (from fragments), flights allowed on particular days (from fragments), and goals including Dubrovnik on days 12 and 16 and any agent-specific requirements. If fragments conflict, I will either resolve them minimally (and state the assumption) or ask you how to prioritize agents.

If you want me to proceed now by making reasonable default assumptions (for example: all agents free each day unless a fragment says otherwise; flights available any day on the allowed legs), say so explicitly — I will then state the assumptions I make and produce the domain and problem. Otherwise, please paste the three fragments and I will produce the integrated PDDL output.
