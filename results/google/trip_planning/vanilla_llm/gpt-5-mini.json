Which of those three stays are flexible, and by how much are you willing to shorten any city?  \n2) Are the listed direct flights bidirectional? Your message said \u201cfrom Dubrovnik to Istanbul, Istanbul and Venice\u201d \u2014 do you mean direct flights exist Dubrovnik\u2194Istanbul and Dubrovnik\u2194Venice (but not Istanbul\u2194Venice)? Or are there direct flights between every pair (Istanbul\u2194Venice too)?  \n3) Do arrival / departure days count as full days in the city (i.e., you count the day you arrive as a day of sightseeing)?\n\nIf you want a ready 11-day plan now, I\u2019ll assume:\n- Direct flights are available Dubrovnik\u2194Istanbul and Dubrovnik\u2194Venice (i.e., Dubrovnik is the hub).\n- Flights are bidirectional.\n- Arrival days count as days in the city.\n- You want to keep Venice at 6 days (non\u2011negotiable), and you\u2019re willing to shorten Dubrovnik and/or Istanbul to fit 11 days.\n\nSample feasible itinerary (keeps Venice = 6 days; fits 11 days total)\n- Days 1\u20136: Venice (6 days)\n- Day 7: Fly Venice \u2192 Dubrovnik (direct).

This meets the relatives requirement and uses only direct flights, but Dublin is only 1 day instead of 3.\n\nOption B \u2014 keep your desired stays in every city (Oslo 3, Valencia 5, Dublin 3) but extend the trip to 11 days:\n- Day 1\u20133: Oslo (3 days)\n  - Day 4: fly Oslo \u2192 Dublin (direct)\n- Day 4\u20136: Dublin (3 days)\n  - Day 7: fly Dublin \u2192 Valencia (direct)\n- Day 7\u201311: Valencia (5 days)\nNotes: All flights are direct.

If you meant you must be in Valencia covering the exact numbered days 5\u20139 of the trip, we can shift the schedule within an extended trip.\n\nIf you want, I can:\n- produce a day\u2011by\u2011day itinerary for either option with suggested flight times and sample arrival/departure timing, or\n- propose alternative splits (e.g., splitting the 3 Dublin days into two short visits) if non\u2011contiguous stays are acceptable.\n\nWhich constraints are flexible: total trip length, Dublin days, or Valencia window?"

    "response": "It\u2019s not possible as stated. Your requested stays add up to 13 days (Berlin 6 + Krakow 5 + Porto 2 = 13) but you specified the whole trip is 11 days. You must either lengthen the trip or shorten at least one city stay.\n\nAlso note the direct-flight graph you gave (Krakow \u2194 Berlin \u2194 Porto, with no direct Porto\u2194Krakow) means any Porto\u2194Krakow movement must go via Berlin.\n\nBefore giving a final plan I need one clarification:\n- Are the city stays required to be contiguous (one continuous block per city), or are non\u2011contiguous visits allowed (for example, split Berlin into two shorter stays)? Also, does \u201cattend a wedding in Porto between day 10 and day 11\u201d mean Porto must be visited on day 10 (or night 10\u201311) specifically?\n\nBelow are feasible options depending on what you allow.\n\nOption A \u2014 Keep your requested stays exactly (Berlin 6, Krakow 5, Porto 2)\n- You must extend the trip to 13 days. A workable 13\u2011day itinerary that respects direct\u2011flight constraints and has Porto on days 10\u201311 (wedding) is:\n  - Days 1\u20135: Krakow (5 days)\n    - Fly Krakow \u2192 Berlin on morning of day 6 (direct)\n  - Days 6\u20139: Berlin (4 of the 6 Berlin days)\n    - Fly Berlin \u2192 Porto on morning of day 10 (direct)\n  - Days 10\u201311: Porto (2 days; wedding)\n    - Fly Porto \u2192 Berlin on morning of day 12 (direct)\n  - Days 12\u201313: Berlin (remaining 2 Berlin days)\n  - Total: 13 days, Berlin total = 4+2 = 6, Krakow = 5, Porto = 2\n  - All intercity flights are direct (Krakow\u2194Berlin and Berlin\u2194Porto only).\n\nOption B \u2014 Keep total trip = 11 days by reducing one or more stays\nHere are a couple of simple 11\u2011day examples (all flights are direct and follow Krakow\u2192Berlin\u2192Porto order so no Porto\u2194Krakow direct needed):\n\n1) Keep Berlin = 6 days and Porto = 2 days; shorten Krakow to 3 days:\n  - Days 1\u20133: Krakow (3)\n    - Fly Krakow \u2192 Berlin day 4\n  - Days 4\u20139: Berlin (6)\n    - Fly Berlin \u2192 Porto day 10\n  - Days 10\u201311: Porto (2; wedding)\n  - Total = 11 days.\n\n2) Keep Krakow = 5 days and Berlin = 6 days; shorten Porto to 0 or 0\u2013? (not meeting your Porto 2 requirement) \u2014 not recommended if Porto attendance is fixed.\n\nOption C \u2014 If non\u2011contiguous stays are acceptable, but total must stay 11\n- Non\u2011contiguous does not solve the basic sum problem: the required totals still sum to 13, so you would still need 13 days. Splitting a city visit helps only with placement around the wedding, not with total days.\n\nSummary and next step\n- If you must have the exact city-day totals you listed, change total trip length to 13 days \u2014 I provided a 13\u2011day plan that meets all constraints (Option A).\n- If total trip must be 11 days, tell me which city length(s) you\u2019re willing to shorten and whether stays must be contiguous; I\u2019ll produce a direct-flight\u2013only itinerary that matches your revised constraints.\n- Also confirm what \u201cbetween day 10 and day 11\u201d precisely means for the wedding (day 10, night 10\u201311, or either day).\n\nTell me which option you prefer or provide the clarifications and I\u2019ll give a complete day\u2011by\u2011day itinerary and suggested flight days."

Given the direct flights you listed (Venice \u21c4 Zurich, and Zurich \u2192 Florence), a simple feasible plan is:\n\n- Days 1\u20136: Venice (6 days)  \n- Day 7: Fly Venice \u2192 Zurich (direct), arrive and start Zurich stay  \n- Days 7\u20138: Zurich (2 days)  \n- Day 9: Fly Zurich \u2192 Florence (direct)  \n- Days 9\u201312: Florence (4 days)\n\nThis uses only direct flights and totals 12 days.\n\n2) If you insist on your preferred lengths (Venice 6 + Florence 6 + Zurich 2), you need to extend the trip to 14 days. A straightforward 14\u2011day plan (also following the direct\u2011flight links) is:\n\n- Days 1\u20136: Venice  \n- Day 7: Fly Venice \u2192 Zurich  \n- Days 7\u20138: Zurich  \n- Day 9: Fly Zurich \u2192 Florence  \n- Days 9\u201314: Florence\n\n3) If you\u2019re flexible about which city gets shortened, you can instead do Venice 4 + Florence 6 + Zurich 2 (or 5+5+2), but note the flight direction matters: with only Zurich\u2192Florence guaranteed, the natural route is Venice \u2192 Zurich \u2192 Florence (or the reverse if Florence\u2192Zurich direct also exists).\n\nTell me which option you prefer (shorten Venice, shorten Florence, or extend to 14 days), and whether the Zurich\u2194Florence flight is two\u2011way for you \u2014 I\u2019ll produce exact flight-day timing and suggest departure/arrival times and connections."

    "response": "Short answer: impossible as stated. You requested 2 + 3 + 7 = 12 days in cities but the trip length is only 10 days. Also, Reykjavik must be scheduled between day 8\u201310, which makes fitting the other two stays even harder.\n\nBefore I propose workable plans, quick notes about the flight network you gave:\n- Direct flights exist only between Frankfurt \u2194 Reykjavik and Frankfurt \u2194 Split.\n- There is no direct Split \u2194 Reykjavik flight, so any travel between Split and Reykjavik must go via Frankfurt (using two direct legs).\n\nOptions you can choose from (pick one and I\u2019ll make a detailed day-by-day plan):\n\n1) Keep your desired stays exactly (Split 7d, Frankfurt 2d, Reykjavik 3d) \u2014 extend the trip to 12 days.\n   - Example 12\u2011day itinerary that keeps Reykjavik on days 8\u201310 (so workshop constraint satisfied) and uses only direct legs:\n     - Days 1\u20137: Split (7 days)\n     - Day 8: Split \u2192 Frankfurt (direct), then Frankfurt \u2192 Reykjavik (direct) same day (this is a same\u2011day connection through Frankfurt) \u2014 start Reykjavik stay\n     - Days 8\u201310: Reykjavik (3 days; workshop in the requested window)\n     - Days 11\u201312: Frankfurt (2 days)\n   - All movements use only direct flights (you do have a same\u2011day connection Split\u2192Frankfurt\u2192Reykjavik on day 8). If you don\u2019t want same\u2011day connections, another 12\u2011day ordering is possible but may move Reykjavik out of days 8\u201310.\n\n2) Keep the trip at 10 days \u2014 reduce one of the city stays so the totals = 10. For example reduce Split to 5 days:\n   - Total: Split 5d + Frankfurt 2d + Reykjavik 3d = 10 days\n   - Feasible itinerary (uses only direct flights):\n     - Days 1\u20135: Split (5 days)\n     - Day 6: Fly Split \u2192 Frankfurt (direct) \u2014 Frankfurt day 6\n     - Day 7: Frankfurt day 7 (2 days in Frankfurt completed)\n     - Day 8: Fly Frankfurt \u2192 Reykjavik (direct) \u2014 start Reykjavik\n     - Days 8\u201310: Reykjavik (3 days; workshop in the requested window)\n\n3) If you only need to attend the workshop sometime between days 8\u201310 (not necessarily that all 3 Reykjavik days must be exactly days 8\u201310) we can shift parts of the Reykjavik stay so at least one Reykjavik day falls on day 8\u201310 while keeping the total trip length 10. (Tell me whether the workshop is a single day or you must be in Reykjavik for the whole 3\u2011day block that falls in 8\u201310.)\n\nWhich would you prefer?\n- Extend to 12 days and keep all stays exactly (Option 1)?\n- Stay at 10 days and reduce Split (or another city) to fit (Option 2)?\n- Or do you want me to craft a 10\u2011day plan that uses same\u2011day flight connections/transits so you keep more of your desired nights (I\u2019ll need to know whether same\u2011day multiple flights / transits are OK and whether travel days count as \u201cspent\u201d)?"

That means any transfer between Bucharest and Dubrovnik must go through Zurich (two direct flights).\n\nI can proceed two ways \u2014 tell me which you prefer, or I can draft examples for each:\n\n1) Extend the trip to 12 days (keeps all your requested lengths and respects the relatives window)\n   - Days 1\u20133: Bucharest (3)\n   - Day 4\u20135: Zurich (2) \u2014 fly B -> Z on morning of day 4\n   - Day 6\u201312: Dubrovnik (7) \u2014 fly Z -> D on morning of day 6\n   - Relatives visit: Dubrovnik days 6\u201312 includes days 6\u201310, so satisfied.\n\n2) Keep 10 days but change one or more city durations (examples)\n   - If Dubrovnik must be 7 contiguous days AND relatives visit must happen between days 4\u201310 (that window is exactly 7 days), Dubrovnik must occupy days 4\u201310. That leaves only days 1\u20133 (3 days) for Bucharest and Zurich combined, so you must shorten either Bucharest or Zurich. Example feasible 10\u2011day plan:\n     - Day 1: Bucharest (1)\n     - Days 2\u20133: Zurich (2)\n     - Days 4\u201310: Dubrovnik (7)\n     (flights: B -> Z day 2; Z -> D day 4)\n   - If you insist Bucharest = 3 and Zurich = 2, you must reduce Dubrovnik (example):\n     - Days 1\u20133: Bucharest (3)\n     - Days 4\u20135: Zurich (2) \u2014 B -> Z on day 4\n     - Days 6\u201310: Dubrovnik (5) \u2014 Z -> D on day 6\n     (relatives visit OK if it only needs to fall within day 4\u201310)\n\n3) Keep all stays but allow Dubrovnik not contiguous by extending total days of trip (or change total-trip length).\n\nWhich constraint(s) are flexible for you?\n- Is the 10\u2011day total fixed?\n- Must Dubrovnik\u2019s 7 days be contiguous?\n- Must relatives visit occur somewhere between day 4 and day 10 (inclusive), or must the entire Dubrovnik stay be within that window?\n\nTell me which you want to change and I\u2019ll give a complete day\u2011by\u2011day itinerary with flight legs."

    "response": "Short answer: your requested stays (Lyon 6 + Zurich 7 + Rome 6 = 19 days) cannot fit into a 17\u2011day trip. Two straightforward options:\n\n1) Keep total = 17 days (must shorten some city stays).\n2) Keep your desired city lengths (6/7/6) but extend the trip to 19 days.\n\nBelow are concrete itineraries for both options. Note: there is no direct flight Lyon \u2194 Zurich, so any Lyon\u2194Zurich movement must go via Rome. The sequence Zurich \u2192 Rome \u2192 Lyon uses only direct flights (Zurich\u2194Rome and Rome\u2194Lyon) and also allows you to be in Zurich during days 1\u20137 for the wedding.\n\nOption A \u2014 Fit everything into 17 days (compromise: Lyon shortened to 4 days)\n- Rationale: keeps Zurich 7 days (so you can attend the wedding between day 1 and 7) and Rome 6 days, reduces Lyon to 4 days so total = 17.\n- Day 1\u20137: Zurich (7 nights). Attend wedding sometime between day 1 and day 7.\n- Day 8: Fly Zurich \u2192 Rome (direct). Arrive Day 8.\n- Day 8\u201313: Rome (6 nights: days 8\u201313).\n- Day 14: Fly Rome \u2192 Lyon (direct). Arrive Day 14.\n- Day 14\u201317: Lyon (4 nights: days 14\u201317).\n- Day 18 (if needed): depart from Lyon homeward.\n\nOption B \u2014 Keep your requested durations (requires 19 days total)\n- Rationale: no compromise on days in each city; total = 19.\n- Day 1\u20137: Zurich (7 nights). Wedding fits between days 1\u20137.\n- Day 8: Fly Zurich \u2192 Rome (direct). Arrive Day 8.\n- Day 8\u201313: Rome (6 nights).\n- Day 14: Fly Rome \u2192 Lyon (direct). Arrive Day 14.\n- Day 14\u201319: Lyon (6 nights).\n- Depart from Lyon on Day 20 (or end of Day 19 depending on flight).\n\nNotes and suggestions\n- If you prefer to keep Lyon at 6 days but must stay within 17 calendar days, we could look at partially counting travel days as stay days (same\u2011day morning/late\u2011night flights), but that still requires compressing at least 2 full nights somewhere.\n- If you want a different order (e.g., start in Lyon), you can, but to meet the wedding constraint (Zurich between day 1\u20137) you must be in Zurich during those early days \u2014 so the route should place Zurich in that first-week window. The Zurich \u2192 Rome \u2192 Lyon sequence is the simplest direct-flight sequence that satisfies the wedding timing.\n- I can convert either option to exact calendar dates and suggest flight times and sample flights if you give me your departure date and home airport.\n\nWhich option would you like me to finalize (A: 17 days with Lyon 4 nights, or B: extend to 19 days to keep 6/7/6)?"

    "response": "Short answer: the constraints are inconsistent. You cannot spend 2 days in each of Split, Manchester and Geneva (2+2+2 = 6 days) if your total trip is only 4 days. Also you need to be in Split at the boundary between Day 2 and Day 3 to meet your friend, which fixes where that night must be spent.\n\nWhich constraint should be relaxed? I can do either:\n- keep the 4\u2011day total (and sacrifice some of the \u201c2 days in X\u201d requests), or\n- keep 2 days in each city and extend the trip to 6 days.\n\nBelow are two concrete, direct\u2011flight itineraries\u2014one for each choice. Pick which you prefer or tell me which city/day counts are flexible and I\u2019ll refine.\n\nOption A \u2014 4\u2011day trip (keeps the meet in Split; Manchester kept as 2 days, Geneva shortened)\n- Day 1: Manchester \u2014 full day in Manchester.\n- Day 2: Manchester \u2014 daytime in Manchester.

Split gets the night and one full day (not two full days). Geneva gets one day. All commutes are on direct flights (Manchester\u2192Split, Split\u2192Geneva).\n\nOption B \u2014 Extend to 6 days (keeps 2 days in each city and the meet)\n- Day 1: Manchester \u2014 Day 1 in Manchester.\n- Day 2: Manchester \u2014 Day 2 in Manchester. Late evening direct flight Manchester \u2192 Split so you arrive in Split for the night.\n- Night between Day 2 and Day 3: in Split \u2014 meet your friend.\n- Day 3: Split \u2014 full day.\n- Day 4: Split \u2014 second full day in Split.\n- Day 5: Split \u2192 Geneva (direct flight), Day 5 in Geneva.\n- Day 6: Geneva \u2014 second full day in Geneva; depart from Geneva.\n\nNotes: This satisfies all your \u201c2 days in each city\u201d wishes and places you in Split at the required boundary. All city hops use direct flights (Manchester\u2192Split, Split\u2192Geneva). If you prefer to end back in Manchester, you can add a direct Geneva\u2192Manchester flight.\n\nWhich option do you want?

    "response": "I can\u2019t make the three requested stays (Reykjavik 5 days + Milan 7 days + Split 3 days) fit into a 13\u2011day trip \u2014 those add up to 15 days. Also note there is no direct Split\u2194Reykjavik flight, so any travel between them must go via Milan (which is fine because there are direct Split\u2194Milan and Milan\u2194Reykjavik flights).\n\nHere are three feasible choices you can pick from (all obey the \u201conly direct flights\u201d rule and the requirement to be in Split between day 1 and day 3):\n\nOption A \u2014 keep Reykjavik 5 days, reduce Milan to 5 days (total 13 days)\n- Days 1\u20133: Split (visit relatives)\n- Day 4: Fly Split \u2192 Milan (direct)\n- Days 4\u20138: Milan (5 days total in Milan, counting day 4 as your first Milan day)\n- Day 9: Fly Milan \u2192 Reykjavik (direct)\n- Days 9\u201313: Reykjavik (5 days)\n\nOption B \u2014 keep Milan 7 days, reduce Reykjavik to 3 days (total 13 days)\n- Days 1\u20133: Split (visit relatives)\n- Day 4: Fly Split \u2192 Milan (direct)\n- Days 4\u201310: Milan (7 days)\n- Day 11: Fly Milan \u2192 Reykjavik (direct)\n- Days 11\u201313: Reykjavik (3 days)\n\nOption C \u2014 keep all requested city-stays and extend the trip to 15 days (no reductions)\n- Days 1\u20133: Split (visit relatives)\n- Day 4: Fly Split \u2192 Milan (direct)\n- Days 4\u201310: Milan (7 days)\n- Day 11: Fly Milan \u2192 Reykjavik (direct)\n- Days 11\u201315: Reykjavik (5 days)\n\nIf you want, I can:\n- produce a more detailed day\u2011by\u2011day schedule (suggest activities, morning/evening flights), or\n- create alternatives that split stays (e.g., return to Milan mid\u2011trip), or\n- adjust which city you end in or the exact flight days/times.\n\nWhich option do you prefer, or would you like me to reallocate days differently?"
