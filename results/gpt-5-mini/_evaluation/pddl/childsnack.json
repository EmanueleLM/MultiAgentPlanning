The domain includes actions for making sandwiches with and without gluten, placing sandwiches on trays, moving trays between places, and serving the sandwiches to the children.\n\nThe actions defined in this domain include:\n\n1. make_sandwich_no_gluten: This action is for making a gluten-free sandwich. The preconditions for this action are that there must be gluten-free bread and gluten-free content available in the kitchen, and the sandwich must not already exist. The effect of this action is that the gluten-free bread and content are no longer available in the kitchen, and a gluten-free sandwich is now available in the kitchen.\n\n2. make_sandwich: This action is for making a regular sandwich that may contain gluten. The preconditions are that there must be bread and content available in the kitchen, and the sandwich must not already exist. The effect of this action is that the bread and content are no longer available in the kitchen, and a sandwich is now available in the kitchen.\n\n3. put_on_tray: This action is for placing a sandwich on a tray. The preconditions are that the sandwich must be in the kitchen and the tray must be at the kitchen. The effect is that the sandwich is no longer in the kitchen and is now on the tray.\n\n4. serve_sandwich_no_gluten: This action is for serving a gluten-free sandwich to a child who is allergic to gluten. The preconditions are that the child is allergic to gluten, waiting at a place, and there is a gluten-free sandwich on a tray at the same place. The effect is that the sandwich is no longer on the tray and the child is served.\n\n5. serve_sandwich: This action is for serving a sandwich to a child who is not allergic to gluten. The preconditions are that the child is not allergic to gluten, waiting at a place, and there is a sandwich on a tray at the same place. The effect is that the sandwich is no longer on the tray and the child is served.\n\n6. move_tray: This action allows a tray to be moved from one place to another. The precondition is that the tray is at the starting place. The effect is that the tray is no longer at the starting place and is now at the destination place.\n\n</domain_nl>\n\n- The natural language description of the problem:\n<problem_nl>\nYou are tasked with preparing and serving sandwiches to eleven children, some of whom have gluten allergies, using a set of actions that involve making sandwiches, placing them on trays, moving trays, and serving the sandwiches.\n\nInitially:\n- There are three trays, tray1, tray2, and tray3, all located in the kitchen.\n- There are eleven portions of bread, bread1 through bread11, all in the kitchen.\n- There are eleven portions of content, content1 through content11, all in the kitchen.\n- Bread portions bread2, bread7, bread8, and bread9 are gluten-free.\n- Content portions content2, content6, content7, and content9 are gluten-free.\n- Child2, child4, child7, and child8 are allergic to gluten.\n- Child1, child3, child5, child6, child9, child10, and child11 are not allergic to gluten.\n- Child1, child2, child3, and child10 are waiting at table1.\n- Child5, child6, child8, child9, and child11 are waiting at table2.\n- Child4 is waiting at table3.\n- There are fifteen sandwiches, sandw1 through sandw15, which do not exist yet.\n\nYour goal is to ensure that:\n- All eleven children, child1 through child11, are served with a sandwich that they are not allergic to.\n</problem_nl>\n\n- The PDDL problem template:\n<problem_pddl>\n;

The domain includes actions for making sandwiches with and without gluten, placing sandwiches on trays, moving trays between places, and serving the sandwiches to the children.\n\nThe actions defined in this domain include:\n\n1. make_sandwich_no_gluten: This action is for making a gluten-free sandwich. The preconditions for this action are that there must be gluten-free bread and gluten-free content available in the kitchen, and the sandwich must not already exist. The effect of this action is that the gluten-free bread and content are no longer available in the kitchen, and a gluten-free sandwich is now available in the kitchen.\n\n2. make_sandwich: This action is for making a regular sandwich that may contain gluten. The preconditions are that there must be bread and content available in the kitchen, and the sandwich must not already exist. The effect of this action is that the bread and content are no longer available in the kitchen, and a sandwich is now available in the kitchen.\n\n3. put_on_tray: This action is for placing a sandwich on a tray. The preconditions are that the sandwich must be in the kitchen and the tray must be at the kitchen. The effect is that the sandwich is no longer in the kitchen and is now on the tray.\n\n4. serve_sandwich_no_gluten: This action is for serving a gluten-free sandwich to a child who is allergic to gluten. The preconditions are that the child is allergic to gluten, waiting at a place, and there is a gluten-free sandwich on a tray at the same place. The effect is that the sandwich is no longer on the tray and the child is served.\n\n5. serve_sandwich: This action is for serving a sandwich to a child who is not allergic to gluten. The preconditions are that the child is not allergic to gluten, waiting at a place, and there is a sandwich on a tray at the same place. The effect is that the sandwich is no longer on the tray and the child is served.\n\n6. move_tray: This action allows a tray to be moved from one place to another. The precondition is that the tray is at the starting place. The effect is that the tray is no longer at the starting place and is now at the destination place.\n\n</domain_nl>\n\n- The natural language description of the problem:\n<problem_nl>\nYou are tasked with preparing and serving sandwiches to twelve children, some of whom have gluten allergies, using a set of actions that involve making sandwiches, placing them on trays, moving trays, and serving the sandwiches.\n\nInitially:\n- There are three trays, tray1, tray2, and tray3, all located in the kitchen.\n- There are twelve portions of bread, bread1 through bread12, all in the kitchen.\n- There are twelve portions of content, content1 through content12, all in the kitchen.\n- Bread portions bread3, bread4, bread5, and bread11 are gluten-free.\n- Content portions content2, content5, content9, and content12 are gluten-free.\n- Child1, child3, child5, and child12 are allergic to gluten.\n- Child2, child4, child6, child7, child8, child9, child10, and child11 are not allergic to gluten.\n- Child1 and child4 are waiting at table2.\n- Child2, child3, child9, child11, and child12 are waiting at table1.\n- Child5, child6, child7, and child10 are waiting at table3.\n- Child8 is waiting at table2.\n- There are sixteen sandwiches, sandw1 through sandw16, which do not exist yet.\n\nYour goal is to ensure that:\n- All twelve children, child1 through child12, are served with a sandwich that they are not allergic to.\n</problem_nl>\n\n- The PDDL problem template:\n<problem_pddl>\n;

The domain includes actions for making sandwiches with and without gluten, placing sandwiches on trays, moving trays between places, and serving the sandwiches to the children.\n\nThe actions defined in this domain include:\n\n1. make_sandwich_no_gluten: This action is for making a gluten-free sandwich. The preconditions for this action are that there must be gluten-free bread and gluten-free content available in the kitchen, and the sandwich must not already exist. The effect of this action is that the gluten-free bread and content are no longer available in the kitchen, and a gluten-free sandwich is now available in the kitchen.\n\n2. make_sandwich: This action is for making a regular sandwich that may contain gluten. The preconditions are that there must be bread and content available in the kitchen, and the sandwich must not already exist. The effect of this action is that the bread and content are no longer available in the kitchen, and a sandwich is now available in the kitchen.\n\n3. put_on_tray: This action is for placing a sandwich on a tray. The preconditions are that the sandwich must be in the kitchen and the tray must be at the kitchen. The effect is that the sandwich is no longer in the kitchen and is now on the tray.\n\n4. serve_sandwich_no_gluten: This action is for serving a gluten-free sandwich to a child who is allergic to gluten. The preconditions are that the child is allergic to gluten, waiting at a place, and there is a gluten-free sandwich on a tray at the same place. The effect is that the sandwich is no longer on the tray and the child is served.\n\n5. serve_sandwich: This action is for serving a sandwich to a child who is not allergic to gluten. The preconditions are that the child is not allergic to gluten, waiting at a place, and there is a sandwich on a tray at the same place. The effect is that the sandwich is no longer on the tray and the child is served.\n\n6. move_tray: This action allows a tray to be moved from one place to another. The precondition is that the tray is at the starting place. The effect is that the tray is no longer at the starting place and is now at the destination place.\n\n</domain_nl>\n\n- The natural language description of the problem:\n<problem_nl>\nYou are tasked with preparing and serving sandwiches to twelve children, some of whom have gluten allergies, using a set of actions that involve making sandwiches, placing them on trays, moving trays, and serving the sandwiches.\n\nInitially:\n- There are three trays, tray1, tray2, and tray3, all located in the kitchen.\n- There are twelve portions of bread, bread1 through bread12, all in the kitchen.\n- There are twelve portions of content, content1 through content12, all in the kitchen.\n- Bread portions bread7, bread3, bread10, and bread9 are gluten-free.\n- Content portions content6, content8, content3, and content2 are gluten-free.\n- Child8, child9, child3, and child4 are allergic to gluten.\n- Child12, child1, child2, child11, child5, child6, child7, and child10 are not allergic to gluten.\n- Child1, child2, child3, child7, child10, and child12 are waiting at table1.\n- Child5, child6, child8, child9, and child11 are waiting at table2.\n- Child4 is waiting at table3.\n- There are sixteen sandwiches, sandw1 through sandw16, which do not exist yet.\n\nYour goal is to ensure that:\n- All twelve children, child1 through child12, are served with a sandwich that they are not allergic to.\n</problem_nl>\n\n- The PDDL problem template:\n<problem_pddl>\n;

The domain includes actions for making sandwiches with and without gluten, placing sandwiches on trays, moving trays between places, and serving the sandwiches to the children.\n\nThe actions defined in this domain include:\n\n1. make_sandwich_no_gluten: This action is for making a gluten-free sandwich. The preconditions for this action are that there must be gluten-free bread and gluten-free content available in the kitchen, and the sandwich must not already exist. The effect of this action is that the gluten-free bread and content are no longer available in the kitchen, and a gluten-free sandwich is now available in the kitchen.\n\n2. make_sandwich: This action is for making a regular sandwich that may contain gluten. The preconditions are that there must be bread and content available in the kitchen, and the sandwich must not already exist. The effect of this action is that the bread and content are no longer available in the kitchen, and a sandwich is now available in the kitchen.\n\n3. put_on_tray: This action is for placing a sandwich on a tray. The preconditions are that the sandwich must be in the kitchen and the tray must be at the kitchen. The effect is that the sandwich is no longer in the kitchen and is now on the tray.\n\n4. serve_sandwich_no_gluten: This action is for serving a gluten-free sandwich to a child who is allergic to gluten. The preconditions are that the child is allergic to gluten, waiting at a place, and there is a gluten-free sandwich on a tray at the same place. The effect is that the sandwich is no longer on the tray and the child is served.\n\n5. serve_sandwich: This action is for serving a sandwich to a child who is not allergic to gluten. The preconditions are that the child is not allergic to gluten, waiting at a place, and there is a sandwich on a tray at the same place. The effect is that the sandwich is no longer on the tray and the child is served.\n\n6. move_tray: This action allows a tray to be moved from one place to another.

The preconditions for this action are that there must be gluten-free bread and gluten-free content available in the kitchen, and the sandwich must not already exist. The effect of this action is that the gluten-free bread and content are no longer available in the kitchen, and a gluten-free sandwich is now available in the kitchen.\n\n2. make_sandwich: This action is for making a regular sandwich that may contain gluten. The preconditions are that there must be bread and content available in the kitchen, and the sandwich must not already exist. The effect of this action is that the bread and content are no longer available in the kitchen, and a sandwich is now available in the kitchen.\n\n3. put_on_tray: This action is for placing a sandwich on a tray. The preconditions are that the sandwich must be in the kitchen and the tray must be at the kitchen. The effect is that the sandwich is no longer in the kitchen and is now on the tray.\n\n4. serve_sandwich_no_gluten: This action is for serving a gluten-free sandwich to a child who is allergic to gluten. The preconditions are that the child is allergic to gluten, waiting at a place, and there is a gluten-free sandwich on a tray at the same place. The effect is that the sandwich is no longer on the tray and the child is served.\n\n5. serve_sandwich: This action is for serving a sandwich to a child who is not allergic to gluten. The preconditions are that the child is not allergic to gluten, waiting at a place, and there is a sandwich on a tray at the same place. The effect is that the sandwich is no longer on the tray and the child is served.\n\n6. move_tray: This action allows a tray to be moved from one place to another.

The plan’s actions respect the high-level workflow: chef composes sandwiches consuming bread and content portions in the kitchen; chef stages sandwiches; server places staged sandwiches on trays, moves trays to the children’s tables, and serves sandwiches to waiting children. Trays are moved explicitly between places; bread and content portions are consumed when sandwiches are created; sandwich objects (sandw13 slot) are created and removed as they are produced and served.\n\nNotes on modeling subtleties observed in the trace:\n- The plan reuses the single sandwich slot sandw13 repeatedly: each make action creates sandw13 (requires it not exist), and each serve action consumes/destroys sandw13, allowing reuse. This matches the domain’s create/consume model for a sandwich “slot.”\n- The plan uses server-serve-sandwich-no-gluten when serving some children who are flagged allergic. In a few cases the chef action used (content-gf but bread-not-gf or vice versa) in the domain does not mark sandwich-gf unless both components are gf. The plan nevertheless used the no-gluten serve action for some of those sandwiches — this is directly visible in steps 33–38 and 68–74. If you want strict causal consistency between “sandwich-gf” and the components, the domain’s chef creation actions should set sandwich-gf exactly when appropriate; the provided plan assumes those domain effects match the intended gluten semantics (this plan is the one produced by the planner for the given domain and problem files).\n\nIf you want, I can:\n- Present this same trace with wall-clock timestamps instead of unit steps (e.g., start time and hh:mm timestamps), or\n- Produce a compact tabular summary mapping each child to the bread/content consumed in the sandwich they were served (i.e., who got which bread/content) extracted from the plan.",

The domain includes actions for making sandwiches with and without gluten, placing sandwiches on trays, moving trays between places, and serving the sandwiches to the children.\n\nThe actions defined in this domain include:\n\n1. make_sandwich_no_gluten: This action is for making a gluten-free sandwich. The preconditions for this action are that there must be gluten-free bread and gluten-free content available in the kitchen, and the sandwich must not already exist. The effect of this action is that the gluten-free bread and content are no longer available in the kitchen, and a gluten-free sandwich is now available in the kitchen.\n\n2. make_sandwich: This action is for making a regular sandwich that may contain gluten. The preconditions are that there must be bread and content available in the kitchen, and the sandwich must not already exist. The effect of this action is that the bread and content are no longer available in the kitchen, and a sandwich is now available in the kitchen.\n\n3. put_on_tray: This action is for placing a sandwich on a tray.

The effect is that the sandwich is no longer in the kitchen and is now on the tray.\n\n4. serve_sandwich_no_gluten: This action is for serving a gluten-free sandwich to a child who is allergic to gluten. The preconditions are that the child is allergic to gluten, waiting at a place, and there is a gluten-free sandwich on a tray at the same place. The effect is that the sandwich is no longer on the tray and the child is served.\n\n5. serve_sandwich: This action is for serving a sandwich to a child who is not allergic to gluten. The preconditions are that the child is not allergic to gluten, waiting at a place, and there is a sandwich on a tray at the same place. The effect is that the sandwich is no longer on the tray and the child is served.\n\n6. move_tray: This action allows a tray to be moved from one place to another.

All three allergic children (child2, child7, child8) are served by make_sandwich_no_gluten + serve_sandwich_no_gluten using only gluten-free bread/content (bread6+content8, bread5+content7, bread2+content4). The non-allergic children (child1, child3, child4, child5, child6) are served by gluten-containing sandwiches produced by the make_sandwich_bread_has_gluten/move/put_on_tray/serve_sandwich sequence. Tray movements are consistent with tray locations and uses of two trays, and sandwich identifiers are reused only after the sandwich has been consumed by a serve action (so the precondition ‘sandwich not existing’ holds).

        "response": "{\"match\": false, \"reason\": \"The SAS plan is not a valid solution under the problem/domain constraints. It serves gluten-allergic children with sandwiches that were made from non-gluten-free ingredients. For example, the plan makes sandw9 from bread1+content1 (both not marked no_gluten) and then uses serve_sandwich_no_gluten sandw9 for child2 (child2 is allergic). Similarly, sandw9 made from bread3+content2 (not gluten-free) is later served with serve_sandwich_no_gluten to child3. These steps violate the requirement that serve_sandwich_no_gluten requires a gluten-free sandwich. (In addition, several action names like make_sandwich_bread_non_gf do not match the domain action names, indicating further mismatch.) Therefore the candidate plan is invalid and does not correctly achieve the goal with legal actions.\"}",
