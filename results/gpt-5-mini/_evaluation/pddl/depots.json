The sequence matches the plan exactly (no actions added or removed). The final goal (next object_8 object_6) is achieved at the end.\n\nInitial facts used (from the chosen initial state):\n- cats object_0, cats object_1\n- collect object_6 object_2, collect object_7 object_3\n- hand object_8\n- next object_0 object_6, next object_1 object_6, next object_4 object_6, next object_5 object_7, next object_8 object_7\n- sneeze object_4, sneeze object_5\n- spring object_6, spring object_7\n- stupendous object_2, stupendous object_3\n- texture object_6, texture object_7\n\nPlan (4 steps, unit cost = 4):\n\nStep 1 — (memory object_1 object_6 object_7)\n- Timestamp: 00:00:00 (duration ~1s)\n- Parameters: ?o0=object_1, ?o1=object_6, ?o2=object_7\n- Action preconditions (memory):\n  1. cats object_1 — satisfied by initial fact (cats object_1)\n  2. spring object_6 — satisfied by initial fact (spring object_6)\n  3. spring object_7 — satisfied by initial fact (spring object_7)\n  4. next object_1 object_6 — satisfied by initial fact (next object_1 object_6)\n- Effects:\n  - Adds: next object_1 object_7\n  - Deletes: next object_1 object_6\n- Verification notes: All preconditions are present in the initial state. After this step the state no longer has next object_1 object_6 but has next object_1 object_7.\n\nStep 2 — (sip object_8 object_1 object_7)\n- Timestamp: 00:00:01 (duration ~1s)\n- Parameters: ?o0=object_8, ?o1=object_1, ?o2=object_7\n- Action preconditions (sip):\n  1. hand object_8 — satisfied by initial fact (hand object_8)\n  2. cats object_1 — satisfied by initial fact (cats object_1)\n  3. texture object_7 — satisfied by initial fact (texture object_7)\n  4. next object_8 object_7 — satisfied by initial fact (next object_8 object_7)\n  5. next object_1 object_7 — satisfied by effect of Step 1 (next object_1 object_7)\n- Effects:\n  - Adds: vase object_8 object_1\n  - Deletes: next object_8 object_7\n- Verification notes: All required preconditions are satisfied (some by initial facts, one by Step 1).

This re-establishes next object_1 object_6 and removes next object_1 object_7.\n\nStep 4 — (paltry object_8 object_1 object_6)\n- Timestamp: 00:00:03 (duration ~1s)\n- Parameters: ?o0=object_8, ?o1=object_1, ?o2=object_6\n- Action preconditions (paltry):\n  1. hand object_8 — satisfied by initial fact (hand object_8)\n  2. cats object_1 — satisfied by initial fact (cats object_1)\n  3. texture object_6 — satisfied by initial fact (texture object_6)\n  4. vase object_8 object_1 — satisfied by effect of Step 2 (vase object_8 object_1)\n  5. next object_1 object_6 — satisfied by effect of Step 3 (next object_1 object_6)\n- Effects:\n  - Adds: next object_8 object_6\n  - Deletes: vase object_8 object_1\n- Verification notes: All preconditions are satisfied (some originated in the initial state, some from prior steps). The action produces next object_8 object_6 and removes vase object_8 object_1.\n\nFinal state relevant facts (after Step 4):\n- next object_8 object_6 — ADDED by Step 4 (this meets the planning goal)\n- next object_1 object_6 — present (re-added by Step 3)\n- vase object_8 object_1 — deleted by Step 4\n- other initial facts unchanged unless explicitly deleted above\n\nConclusion\n- The provided sequence of four actions exactly matches the plan and is compliant with the domain/action precondition/effect definitions and the chosen initial state.\n- Every action’s preconditions are satisfied at the time it is executed (some by the initial state, some by effects of earlier actions). No missing facts or ambiguous references prevent verification.\n- The final goal next object_8 object_6 is achieved at the end of Step 4 (timestamp ~00:00:03).\n- Plan cost: 4 (unit cost per action).",
