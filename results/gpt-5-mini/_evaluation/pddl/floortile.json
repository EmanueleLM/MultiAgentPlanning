      "prompt_0shot": "You are an expert planner. I will provide you with:\n- A natural language description of the domain.\n- A natural language description of the problem. \n- A PDDL domain template.\n- A PDDL problem template.\n\nHere are:\n- The natural language description of the domain:\n<domain_nl>\nThe floor-tile domain is designed for planning the actions of robots to paint floor tiles with two colors. Each robot can move in four directions (up, down, right, left), change the color of paint it is carrying, and paint adjacent tiles. The domain also tracks the total cost of actions performed.\n\nThe actions defined in this domain include:\n\n1. change-color: This action allows a robot to change the color it has. The preconditions are that the robot currently has a color and the new color is available. The effect is that the robot no longer has the old color and now has the new color. This action increases the total cost by 5.\n\n2. paint-up: This action allows a robot to paint the tile above its current position. The preconditions are that the robot has a color, is at a certain tile, the tile above is clear, and the robot can move up. The effect is that the tile above is no longer clear and is now painted with the robot's color. This action increases the total cost by 2.\n\n3. paint-down: This action allows a robot to paint the tile below its current position. The preconditions are that the robot has a color, is at a certain tile, the tile below is clear, and the robot can move down. The effect is that the tile below is no longer clear and is now painted with the robot's color. This action increases the total cost by 2.\n\n4. up: This action allows a robot to move up to the tile above its current position. The preconditions are that the robot is at a certain tile, the tile above is clear, and the robot can move up. The effect is that the robot is now at the tile above, the tile it was previously at is now clear, and the tile it moved to is no longer clear. This action increases the total cost by 3.\n\n5. down: This action allows a robot to move down to the tile below its current position. The preconditions are that the robot is at a certain tile, the tile below is clear, and the robot can move down. The effect is that the robot is now at the tile below, the tile it was previously at is now clear, and the tile it moved to is no longer clear. This action increases the total cost by 1.\n\n6. right: This action allows a robot to move to the right to the tile adjacent to its current position. The preconditions are that the robot is at a certain tile, the tile to the right is clear, and the robot can move right. The effect is that the robot is now at the tile to the right, the tile it was previously at is now clear, and the tile it moved to is no longer clear. This action increases the total cost by 1.\n\n7. left: This action allows a robot to move to the left to the tile adjacent to its current position. The preconditions are that the robot is at a certain tile, the tile to the left is clear, and the robot can move left. The effect is that the robot is now at the tile to the left, the tile it was previously at is now clear, and the tile it moved to is no longer clear. This action increases the total cost by 1.\n\n</domain_nl>\n\n- The natural language description of the problem:\n<problem_nl>\nYou control a set of robots that can paint floor tiles with different colors. The robots can move in four directions: up, down, left, and right. They can paint with one color at a time and can change the color of their spray guns. Tiles can only be painted in the front (up) or behind (down) the robot, and once a tile is painted, no robot can stand on it.\n\nInitially:\n- There are fifteen tiles arranged in a 5x3 grid (tile_0-1 to tile_4-3).\n- Robot1 is at tile_4-1 and has a white spray gun.\n- Robot2 is at tile_4-3 and has a black spray gun.\n- The colors white and black are available for painting.\n- All tiles except tile_4-1 and tile_4-3 are clear and unpainted.\n- The tiles have directional relationships with each other, allowing the robots to move up, down, left, and right between adjacent tiles.\n\nYour goal is to paint the following tiles with the specified colors:\n- Tile tile_1-1 should be painted white.\n- Tile tile_1-2 should be painted black.\n- Tile tile_1-3 should be painted white.\n- Tile tile_2-1 should be painted black.\n- Tile tile_2-2 should be painted white.\n- Tile tile_2-3 should be painted black.\n- Tile tile_3-1 should be painted white.\n- Tile tile_3-2 should be painted black.\n- Tile tile_3-3 should be painted white.\n- Tile tile_4-1 should be painted black.\n- Tile tile_4-2 should be painted white.\n- Tile tile_4-3 should be painted black.\n\nAdditionally, you aim to minimize the total cost of the actions taken to achieve this goal.\n</problem_nl>\n\n- The PDDL problem template:\n<problem_pddl>\n(define (problem p01-432)\n (:domain floor-tile)\n (:objects tile_0-1 tile_0-2 tile_0-3 \n           tile_1-1 tile_1-2 tile_1-3 \n           tile_2-1 tile_2-2 tile_2-3 \n           tile_3-1 tile_3-2 tile_3-3 \n           tile_4-1 tile_4-2 tile_4-3 -

Each robot can move in four directions (up, down, right, left), change the color of paint it is carrying, and paint adjacent tiles. The domain also tracks the total cost of actions performed.\n\nThe actions defined in this domain include:\n\n1. change-color: This action allows a robot to change the color it has. The preconditions are that the robot currently has a color and the new color is available. The effect is that the robot no longer has the old color and now has the new color. This action increases the total cost by 5.\n\n2. paint-up: This action allows a robot to paint the tile above its current position. The preconditions are that the robot has a color, is at a certain tile, the tile above is clear, and the robot can move up. The effect is that the tile above is no longer clear and is now painted with the robot's color. This action increases the total cost by 2.\n\n3. paint-down: This action allows a robot to paint the tile below its current position. The preconditions are that the robot has a color, is at a certain tile, the tile below is clear, and the robot can move down. The effect is that the tile below is no longer clear and is now painted with the robot's color. This action increases the total cost by 2.\n\n4. up: This action allows a robot to move up to the tile above its current position. The preconditions are that the robot is at a certain tile, the tile above is clear, and the robot can move up. The effect is that the robot is now at the tile above, the tile it was previously at is now clear, and the tile it moved to is no longer clear. This action increases the total cost by 3.\n\n5. down: This action allows a robot to move down to the tile below its current position. The preconditions are that the robot is at a certain tile, the tile below is clear, and the robot can move down. The effect is that the robot is now at the tile below, the tile it was previously at is now clear, and the tile it moved to is no longer clear. This action increases the total cost by 1.\n\n6. right: This action allows a robot to move to the right to the tile adjacent to its current position. The preconditions are that the robot is at a certain tile, the tile to the right is clear, and the robot can move right. The effect is that the robot is now at the tile to the right, the tile it was previously at is now clear, and the tile it moved to is no longer clear. This action increases the total cost by 1.\n\n7. left: This action allows a robot to move to the left to the tile adjacent to its current position. The preconditions are that the robot is at a certain tile, the tile to the left is clear, and the robot can move left. The effect is that the robot is now at the tile to the left, the tile it was previously at is now clear, and the tile it moved to is no longer clear. This action increases the total cost by 1.\n\n</domain_nl>\n\n- The natural language description of the problem:\n<problem_nl>\nYou control a set of robots that can paint floor tiles with different colors. The robots can move in four directions: up, down, left, and right. They can paint with one color at a time and can change the color of their spray guns. Tiles can only be painted in the front (up) or behind (down) the robot, and once a tile is painted, no robot can stand on it.\n\nInitially:\n- There are fifteen tiles arranged in a 5x3 grid (tile_0-1 to tile_4-3).\n- Robot1 is at tile_3-2 and has a white spray gun.\n- Robot2 is at tile_4-1 and has a black spray gun.\n- The colors white and black are available for painting.\n- All tiles except tile_3-2 and tile_4-1 are clear and unpainted.\n- The tiles have directional relationships with each other, allowing the robots to move up, down, left, and right between adjacent tiles.\n\nYour goal is to paint the following tiles with the specified colors:\n- Tile tile_1-1 should be painted white.\n- Tile tile_1-2 should be painted black.\n- Tile tile_1-3 should be painted white.\n- Tile tile_2-1 should be painted black.\n- Tile tile_2-2 should be painted white.\n- Tile tile_2-3 should be painted black.\n- Tile tile_3-1 should be painted white.\n- Tile tile_3-2 should be painted black.\n- Tile tile_3-3 should be painted white.\n- Tile tile_4-1 should be painted black.\n- Tile tile_4-2 should be painted white.\n- Tile tile_4-3 should be painted black.\n\nAdditionally, you aim to minimize the total cost of the actions taken to achieve this goal.\n</problem_nl>\n\n- The PDDL problem template:\n<problem_pddl>\n(define (problem p02-432)\n (:domain floor-tile)\n (:objects tile_0-1 tile_0-2 tile_0-3 \n           tile_1-1 tile_1-2 tile_1-3 \n           tile_2-1 tile_2-2 tile_2-3 \n           tile_3-1 tile_3-2 tile_3-3 \n           tile_4-1 tile_4-2 tile_4-3 -

The preconditions are that the robot is at a certain tile, the tile above is clear, and the robot can move up. The effect is that the robot is now at the tile above, the tile it was previously at is now clear, and the tile it moved to is no longer clear. This action increases the total cost by 3.\n\n5. down: This action allows a robot to move down to the tile below its current position. The preconditions are that the robot is at a certain tile, the tile below is clear, and the robot can move down. The effect is that the robot is now at the tile below, the tile it was previously at is now clear, and the tile it moved to is no longer clear. This action increases the total cost by 1.\n\n6. right: This action allows a robot to move to the right to the tile adjacent to its current position. The preconditions are that the robot is at a certain tile, the tile to the right is clear, and the robot can move right. The effect is that the robot is now at the tile to the right, the tile it was previously at is now clear, and the tile it moved to is no longer clear. This action increases the total cost by 1.\n\n7. left: This action allows a robot to move to the left to the tile adjacent to its current position. The preconditions are that the robot is at a certain tile, the tile to the left is clear, and the robot can move left. The effect is that the robot is now at the tile to the left, the tile it was previously at is now clear, and the tile it moved to is no longer clear. This action increases the total cost by 1.\n\n</domain_nl>\n\n- The natural language description of the problem:\n<problem_nl>\nYou control a set of robots that can paint floor tiles with different colors. The robots can move in four directions: up, down, left, and right. They can paint with one color at a time and can change the color of their spray guns. Tiles can only be painted in the front (up) or behind (down) the robot, and once a tile is painted, no robot can stand on it.\n\nInitially:\n- There are twenty-four tiles arranged in a 6x4 grid (tile_0-1 to tile_5-4).\n- Robot1 is at tile_1-3 and has a white spray gun.\n- Robot2 is at tile_5-2 and has a black spray gun.\n- The colors white and black are available for painting.\n- All tiles are clear and unpainted.\n- The tiles have directional relationships with each other, allowing the robots to move up, down, left, and right between adjacent tiles.\n\nYour goal is to paint the following tiles with the specified colors:\n- Tile tile_1-1 should be painted white.\n- Tile tile_1-2 should be painted black.\n- Tile tile_1-3 should be painted white.\n- Tile tile_1-4 should be painted black.\n- Tile tile_2-1 should be painted black.\n- Tile tile_2-2 should be painted white.\n- Tile tile_2-3 should be painted black.\n- Tile tile_2-4 should be painted white.\n- Tile tile_3-1 should be painted white.\n- Tile tile_3-2 should be painted black.\n- Tile tile_3-3 should be painted white.\n- Tile tile_3-4 should be painted black.\n- Tile tile_4-1 should be painted black.\n- Tile tile_4-2 should be painted white.\n- Tile tile_4-3 should be painted black.\n- Tile tile_4-4 should be painted white.\n- Tile tile_5-1 should be painted white.\n- Tile tile_5-2 should be painted black.\n- Tile tile_5-3 should be painted white.\n- Tile tile_5-4 should be painted black.\n\nAdditionally, you aim to minimize the total cost of the actions taken to achieve this goal.\n</problem_nl>\n\n- The PDDL problem template:\n<problem_pddl>\n(define (problem p11-542)\n (:domain floor-tile)\n (:objects tile_0-1 tile_0-2 tile_0-3 tile_0-4 \n           tile_1-1 tile_1-2 tile_1-3 tile_1-4 \n           tile_2-1 tile_2-2 tile_2-3 tile_2-4 \n           tile_3-1 tile_3-2 tile_3-3 tile_3-4 \n           tile_4-1 tile_4-2 tile_4-3 tile_4-4 \n           tile_5-1 tile_5-2 tile_5-3 tile_5-4 -

I will provide you with:\n- A natural language description of the domain.\n- A natural language description of the problem. \n- A PDDL domain template.\n- A PDDL problem template.\n\nHere are:\n- The natural language description of the domain:\n<domain_nl>\nThe floor-tile domain is designed for planning the actions of robots to paint floor tiles with two colors. Each robot can move in four directions (up, down, right, left), change the color of paint it is carrying, and paint adjacent tiles. The domain also tracks the total cost of actions performed.\n\nThe actions defined in this domain include:\n\n1. change-color: This action allows a robot to change the color it has. The preconditions are that the robot currently has a color and the new color is available. The effect is that the robot no longer has the old color and now has the new color. This action increases the total cost by 5.\n\n2. paint-up: This action allows a robot to paint the tile above its current position. The preconditions are that the robot has a color, is at a certain tile, the tile above is clear, and the robot can move up. The effect is that the tile above is no longer clear and is now painted with the robot's color. This action increases the total cost by 2.\n\n3. paint-down: This action allows a robot to paint the tile below its current position. The preconditions are that the robot has a color, is at a certain tile, the tile below is clear, and the robot can move down. The effect is that the tile below is no longer clear and is now painted with the robot's color. This action increases the total cost by 2.\n\n4. up: This action allows a robot to move up to the tile above its current position. The preconditions are that the robot is at a certain tile, the tile above is clear, and the robot can move up. The effect is that the robot is now at the tile above, the tile it was previously at is now clear, and the tile it moved to is no longer clear. This action increases the total cost by 3.\n\n5. down: This action allows a robot to move down to the tile below its current position. The preconditions are that the robot is at a certain tile, the tile below is clear, and the robot can move down. The effect is that the robot is now at the tile below, the tile it was previously at is now clear, and the tile it moved to is no longer clear. This action increases the total cost by 1.\n\n6. right: This action allows a robot to move to the right to the tile adjacent to its current position. The preconditions are that the robot is at a certain tile, the tile to the right is clear, and the robot can move right. The effect is that the robot is now at the tile to the right, the tile it was previously at is now clear, and the tile it moved to is no longer clear. This action increases the total cost by 1.\n\n7. left: This action allows a robot to move to the left to the tile adjacent to its current position. The preconditions are that the robot is at a certain tile, the tile to the left is clear, and the robot can move left. The effect is that the robot is now at the tile to the left, the tile it was previously at is now clear, and the tile it moved to is no longer clear. This action increases the total cost by 1.\n\n</domain_nl>\n\n- The natural language description of the problem:\n<problem_nl>\nYou control a set of robots that can paint floor tiles with different colors. The robots can move in four directions: up, down, left, and right. They can paint with one color at a time and can change the color of their spray guns. Tiles can only be painted in the front (up) or behind (down) the robot, and once a tile is painted, no robot can stand on it.\n\nInitially:\n- There are twenty-four tiles arranged in a 6x4 grid (tile_0-1 to tile_5-4).\n- Robot1 is at tile_1-4 and has a white spray gun.\n- Robot2 is at tile_2-3 and has a black spray gun.\n- The colors white and black are available for painting.\n- All tiles are clear and unpainted.\n- The tiles have directional relationships with each other, allowing the robots to move up, down, left, and right between adjacent tiles.\n\nYour goal is to paint the following tiles with the specified colors:\n- Tile tile_1-1 should be painted white.\n- Tile tile_1-2 should be painted black.\n- Tile tile_1-3 should be painted white.\n- Tile tile_1-4 should be painted black.\n- Tile tile_2-1 should be painted black.\n- Tile tile_2-2 should be painted white.\n- Tile tile_2-3 should be painted black.\n- Tile tile_2-4 should be painted white.\n- Tile tile_3-1 should be painted white.\n- Tile tile_3-2 should be painted black.\n- Tile tile_3-3 should be painted white.\n- Tile tile_3-4 should be painted black.\n- Tile tile_4-1 should be painted black.\n- Tile tile_4-2 should be painted white.\n- Tile tile_4-3 should be painted black.\n- Tile tile_4-4 should be painted white.\n- Tile tile_5-1 should be painted white.\n- Tile tile_5-2 should be painted black.\n- Tile tile_5-3 should be painted white.\n- Tile tile_5-4 should be painted black.\n\nAdditionally, you aim to minimize the total cost of the actions taken to achieve this goal.\n</problem_nl>\n\n- The PDDL problem template:\n<problem_pddl>\n(define (problem p12-542)\n (:domain floor-tile)\n (:objects tile_0-1 tile_0-2 tile_0-3 tile_0-4 \n           tile_1-1 tile_1-2 tile_1-3 tile_1-4 \n           tile_2-1 tile_2-2 tile_2-3 tile_2-4 \n           tile_3-1 tile_3-2 tile_3-3 tile_3-4 \n           tile_4-1 tile_4-2 tile_4-3 tile_4-4 \n           tile_5-1 tile_5-2 tile_5-3 tile_5-4 -

I will provide you with:\n- A natural language description of the domain.\n- A natural language description of the problem. \n- A PDDL domain template.\n- A PDDL problem template.\n\nHere are:\n- The natural language description of the domain:\n<domain_nl>\nThe floor-tile domain is designed for planning the actions of robots to paint floor tiles with two colors. Each robot can move in four directions (up, down, right, left), change the color of paint it is carrying, and paint adjacent tiles. The domain also tracks the total cost of actions performed.\n\nThe actions defined in this domain include:\n\n1. change-color: This action allows a robot to change the color it has. The preconditions are that the robot currently has a color and the new color is available. The effect is that the robot no longer has the old color and now has the new color. This action increases the total cost by 5.\n\n2. paint-up: This action allows a robot to paint the tile above its current position. The preconditions are that the robot has a color, is at a certain tile, the tile above is clear, and the robot can move up. The effect is that the tile above is no longer clear and is now painted with the robot's color. This action increases the total cost by 2.\n\n3. paint-down: This action allows a robot to paint the tile below its current position. The preconditions are that the robot has a color, is at a certain tile, the tile below is clear, and the robot can move down. The effect is that the tile below is no longer clear and is now painted with the robot's color. This action increases the total cost by 2.\n\n4. up: This action allows a robot to move up to the tile above its current position. The preconditions are that the robot is at a certain tile, the tile above is clear, and the robot can move up. The effect is that the robot is now at the tile above, the tile it was previously at is now clear, and the tile it moved to is no longer clear. This action increases the total cost by 3.\n\n5. down: This action allows a robot to move down to the tile below its current position. The preconditions are that the robot is at a certain tile, the tile below is clear, and the robot can move down. The effect is that the robot is now at the tile below, the tile it was previously at is now clear, and the tile it moved to is no longer clear. This action increases the total cost by 1.\n\n6. right: This action allows a robot to move to the right to the tile adjacent to its current position. The preconditions are that the robot is at a certain tile, the tile to the right is clear, and the robot can move right. The effect is that the robot is now at the tile to the right, the tile it was previously at is now clear, and the tile it moved to is no longer clear. This action increases the total cost by 1.\n\n7. left: This action allows a robot to move to the left to the tile adjacent to its current position. The preconditions are that the robot is at a certain tile, the tile to the left is clear, and the robot can move left. The effect is that the robot is now at the tile to the left, the tile it was previously at is now clear, and the tile it moved to is no longer clear. This action increases the total cost by 1.\n\n</domain_nl>\n\n- The natural language description of the problem:\n<problem_nl>\nYou control a set of robots that can paint floor tiles with different colors. The robots can move in four directions: up, down, left, and right. They can paint with one color at a time and can change the color of their spray guns. Tiles can only be painted in the front (up) or behind (down) the robot, and once a tile is painted, no robot can stand on it.\n\nInitially:\n- There are fifteen tiles arranged in a 5x3 grid (tile_0-1 to tile_4-3).\n- Robot1 is at tile_2-3 and has a white spray gun.\n- Robot2 is at tile_1-1 and has a black spray gun.\n- The colors white and black are available for painting.\n- All tiles except tile_1-1 and tile_2-3 are clear and unpainted.\n- The tiles have directional relationships with each other, allowing the robots to move up, down, left, and right between adjacent tiles.\n\nYour goal is to paint the following tiles with the specified colors:\n- Tile tile_1-1 should be painted white.\n- Tile tile_1-2 should be painted black.\n- Tile tile_1-3 should be painted white.\n- Tile tile_2-1 should be painted black.\n- Tile tile_2-2 should be painted white.\n- Tile tile_2-3 should be painted black.\n- Tile tile_3-1 should be painted white.\n- Tile tile_3-2 should be painted black.\n- Tile tile_3-3 should be painted white.\n- Tile tile_4-1 should be painted black.\n- Tile tile_4-2 should be painted white.\n- Tile tile_4-3 should be painted black.\n\nAdditionally, you aim to minimize the total cost of the actions taken to achieve this goal.\n</problem_nl>\n\n- The PDDL problem template:\n<problem_pddl>\n(define (problem p03-432)\n (:domain floor-tile)\n (:objects tile_0-1 tile_0-2 tile_0-3 \n           tile_1-1 tile_1-2 tile_1-3 \n           tile_2-1 tile_2-2 tile_2-3 \n           tile_3-1 tile_3-2 tile_3-3 \n           tile_4-1 tile_4-2 tile_4-3 -

      "prompt_0shot": "You are an expert planner. I will provide you with:\n- A natural language description of the domain.\n- A natural language description of the problem. \n- A PDDL domain template.\n- A PDDL problem template.\n\nHere are:\n- The natural language description of the domain:\n<domain_nl>\nThe floor-tile domain is designed for planning the actions of robots to paint floor tiles with two colors. Each robot can move in four directions (up, down, right, left), change the color of paint it is carrying, and paint adjacent tiles. The domain also tracks the total cost of actions performed.\n\nThe actions defined in this domain include:\n\n1. change-color: This action allows a robot to change the color it has. The preconditions are that the robot currently has a color and the new color is available. The effect is that the robot no longer has the old color and now has the new color. This action increases the total cost by 5.\n\n2. paint-up: This action allows a robot to paint the tile above its current position. The preconditions are that the robot has a color, is at a certain tile, the tile above is clear, and the robot can move up. The effect is that the tile above is no longer clear and is now painted with the robot's color. This action increases the total cost by 2.\n\n3. paint-down: This action allows a robot to paint the tile below its current position. The preconditions are that the robot has a color, is at a certain tile, the tile below is clear, and the robot can move down. The effect is that the tile below is no longer clear and is now painted with the robot's color. This action increases the total cost by 2.\n\n4. up: This action allows a robot to move up to the tile above its current position. The preconditions are that the robot is at a certain tile, the tile above is clear, and the robot can move up. The effect is that the robot is now at the tile above, the tile it was previously at is now clear, and the tile it moved to is no longer clear. This action increases the total cost by 3.\n\n5. down: This action allows a robot to move down to the tile below its current position. The preconditions are that the robot is at a certain tile, the tile below is clear, and the robot can move down. The effect is that the robot is now at the tile below, the tile it was previously at is now clear, and the tile it moved to is no longer clear. This action increases the total cost by 1.\n\n6. right: This action allows a robot to move to the right to the tile adjacent to its current position. The preconditions are that the robot is at a certain tile, the tile to the right is clear, and the robot can move right. The effect is that the robot is now at the tile to the right, the tile it was previously at is now clear, and the tile it moved to is no longer clear. This action increases the total cost by 1.\n\n7. left: This action allows a robot to move to the left to the tile adjacent to its current position. The preconditions are that the robot is at a certain tile, the tile to the left is clear, and the robot can move left. The effect is that the robot is now at the tile to the left, the tile it was previously at is now clear, and the tile it moved to is no longer clear. This action increases the total cost by 1.\n\n</domain_nl>\n\n- The natural language description of the problem:\n<problem_nl>\nYou control a set of robots that can paint floor tiles with different colors. The robots can move in four directions: up, down, left, and right. They can paint with one color at a time and can change the color of their spray guns. Tiles can only be painted in the front (up) or behind (down) the robot, and once a tile is painted, no robot can stand on it.\n\nInitially:\n- There are sixteen tiles arranged in a 4x4 grid (tile_0-1 to tile_4-4).\n- Robot1 is at tile_0-3 and has a white spray gun.\n- Robot2 is at tile_3-4 and has a black spray gun.\n- The colors white and black are available for painting.\n- All tiles are clear and unpainted except for the ones where the robots are located.\n- The tiles have directional relationships with each other, allowing the robots to move up, down, left, and right between adjacent tiles.\n\nYour goal is to paint the following tiles with the specified colors:\n- Tile tile_1-1 should be painted white.\n- Tile tile_1-2 should be painted black.\n- Tile tile_1-3 should be painted white.\n- Tile tile_1-4 should be painted black.\n- Tile tile_2-1 should be painted black.\n- Tile tile_2-2 should be painted white.\n- Tile tile_2-3 should be painted black.\n- Tile tile_2-4 should be painted white.\n- Tile tile_3-1 should be painted white.\n- Tile tile_3-2 should be painted black.\n- Tile tile_3-3 should be painted white.\n- Tile tile_3-4 should be painted black.\n- Tile tile_4-1 should be painted black.\n- Tile tile_4-2 should be painted white.\n- Tile tile_4-3 should be painted black.\n- Tile tile_4-4 should be painted white.\n\nAdditionally, you aim to minimize the total cost of the actions taken to achieve this goal.\n</problem_nl>\n\n- The PDDL problem template:\n<problem_pddl>\n(define (problem p04-442)\n (:domain floor-tile)\n (:objects tile_0-1 tile_0-2 tile_0-3 tile_0-4 \n           tile_1-1 tile_1-2 tile_1-3 tile_1-4 \n           tile_2-1 tile_2-2 tile_2-3 tile_2-4 \n           tile_3-1 tile_3-2 tile_3-3 tile_3-4 \n           tile_4-1 tile_4-2 tile_4-3 tile_4-4 -

I will provide you with:\n- A natural language description of the domain.\n- A natural language description of the problem. \n- A PDDL domain template.\n- A PDDL problem template.\n\nHere are:\n- The natural language description of the domain:\n<domain_nl>\nThe floor-tile domain is designed for planning the actions of robots to paint floor tiles with two colors. Each robot can move in four directions (up, down, right, left), change the color of paint it is carrying, and paint adjacent tiles. The domain also tracks the total cost of actions performed.\n\nThe actions defined in this domain include:\n\n1. change-color: This action allows a robot to change the color it has. The preconditions are that the robot currently has a color and the new color is available. The effect is that the robot no longer has the old color and now has the new color. This action increases the total cost by 5.\n\n2. paint-up: This action allows a robot to paint the tile above its current position. The preconditions are that the robot has a color, is at a certain tile, the tile above is clear, and the robot can move up. The effect is that the tile above is no longer clear and is now painted with the robot's color. This action increases the total cost by 2.\n\n3. paint-down: This action allows a robot to paint the tile below its current position. The preconditions are that the robot has a color, is at a certain tile, the tile below is clear, and the robot can move down. The effect is that the tile below is no longer clear and is now painted with the robot's color. This action increases the total cost by 2.\n\n4. up: This action allows a robot to move up to the tile above its current position. The preconditions are that the robot is at a certain tile, the tile above is clear, and the robot can move up. The effect is that the robot is now at the tile above, the tile it was previously at is now clear, and the tile it moved to is no longer clear. This action increases the total cost by 3.\n\n5. down: This action allows a robot to move down to the tile below its current position. The preconditions are that the robot is at a certain tile, the tile below is clear, and the robot can move down. The effect is that the robot is now at the tile below, the tile it was previously at is now clear, and the tile it moved to is no longer clear. This action increases the total cost by 1.\n\n6. right: This action allows a robot to move to the right to the tile adjacent to its current position. The preconditions are that the robot is at a certain tile, the tile to the right is clear, and the robot can move right. The effect is that the robot is now at the tile to the right, the tile it was previously at is now clear, and the tile it moved to is no longer clear. This action increases the total cost by 1.\n\n7. left: This action allows a robot to move to the left to the tile adjacent to its current position. The preconditions are that the robot is at a certain tile, the tile to the left is clear, and the robot can move left. The effect is that the robot is now at the tile to the left, the tile it was previously at is now clear, and the tile it moved to is no longer clear. This action increases the total cost by 1.\n\n</domain_nl>\n\n- The natural language description of the problem:\n<problem_nl>\nYou control a set of robots that can paint floor tiles with different colors. The robots can move in four directions: up, down, left, and right. They can paint with one color at a time and can change the color of their spray guns. Tiles can only be painted in the front (up) or behind (down) the robot, and once a tile is painted, no robot can stand on it.\n\nInitially:\n- There are sixteen tiles arranged in a 4x4 grid (tile_0-1 to tile_4-4).\n- Robot1 is at tile_4-1 and has a white spray gun.\n- Robot2 is at tile_2-4 and has a black spray gun.\n- The colors white and black are available for painting.\n- All tiles except tile_2-4 are clear and unpainted.\n- The tiles have directional relationships with each other, allowing the robots to move up, down, left, and right between adjacent tiles.\n\nYour goal is to paint the following tiles with the specified colors:\n- Tile tile_1-1 should be painted white.\n- Tile tile_1-2 should be painted black.\n- Tile tile_1-3 should be painted white.\n- Tile tile_1-4 should be painted black.\n- Tile tile_2-1 should be painted black.\n- Tile tile_2-2 should be painted white.\n- Tile tile_2-3 should be painted black.\n- Tile tile_2-4 should be painted white.\n- Tile tile_3-1 should be painted white.\n- Tile tile_3-2 should be painted black.\n- Tile tile_3-3 should be painted white.\n- Tile tile_3-4 should be painted black.\n- Tile tile_4-1 should be painted black.\n- Tile tile_4-2 should be painted white.\n- Tile tile_4-3 should be painted black.\n- Tile tile_4-4 should be painted white.\n\nAdditionally, you aim to minimize the total cost of the actions taken to achieve this goal.\n</problem_nl>\n\n- The PDDL problem template:\n<problem_pddl>\n(define (problem p05-442)\n (:domain floor-tile)\n (:objects tile_0-1 tile_0-2 tile_0-3 tile_0-4 \n           tile_1-1 tile_1-2 tile_1-3 tile_1-4 \n           tile_2-1 tile_2-2 tile_2-3 tile_2-4 \n           tile_3-1 tile_3-2 tile_3-3 tile_3-4 \n           tile_4-1 tile_4-2 tile_4-3 tile_4-4 -

I will provide you with:\n- A natural language description of the domain.\n- A natural language description of the problem. \n- A PDDL domain template.\n- A PDDL problem template.\n\nHere are:\n- The natural language description of the domain:\n<domain_nl>\nThe floor-tile domain is designed for planning the actions of robots to paint floor tiles with two colors. Each robot can move in four directions (up, down, right, left), change the color of paint it is carrying, and paint adjacent tiles. The domain also tracks the total cost of actions performed.\n\nThe actions defined in this domain include:\n\n1. change-color: This action allows a robot to change the color it has. The preconditions are that the robot currently has a color and the new color is available. The effect is that the robot no longer has the old color and now has the new color. This action increases the total cost by 5.\n\n2. paint-up: This action allows a robot to paint the tile above its current position. The preconditions are that the robot has a color, is at a certain tile, the tile above is clear, and the robot can move up. The effect is that the tile above is no longer clear and is now painted with the robot's color. This action increases the total cost by 2.\n\n3. paint-down: This action allows a robot to paint the tile below its current position. The preconditions are that the robot has a color, is at a certain tile, the tile below is clear, and the robot can move down. The effect is that the tile below is no longer clear and is now painted with the robot's color. This action increases the total cost by 2.\n\n4. up: This action allows a robot to move up to the tile above its current position. The preconditions are that the robot is at a certain tile, the tile above is clear, and the robot can move up. The effect is that the robot is now at the tile above, the tile it was previously at is now clear, and the tile it moved to is no longer clear. This action increases the total cost by 3.\n\n5. down: This action allows a robot to move down to the tile below its current position. The preconditions are that the robot is at a certain tile, the tile below is clear, and the robot can move down. The effect is that the robot is now at the tile below, the tile it was previously at is now clear, and the tile it moved to is no longer clear. This action increases the total cost by 1.\n\n6. right: This action allows a robot to move to the right to the tile adjacent to its current position. The preconditions are that the robot is at a certain tile, the tile to the right is clear, and the robot can move right. The effect is that the robot is now at the tile to the right, the tile it was previously at is now clear, and the tile it moved to is no longer clear. This action increases the total cost by 1.\n\n7. left: This action allows a robot to move to the left to the tile adjacent to its current position. The preconditions are that the robot is at a certain tile, the tile to the left is clear, and the robot can move left. The effect is that the robot is now at the tile to the left, the tile it was previously at is now clear, and the tile it moved to is no longer clear. This action increases the total cost by 1.\n\n</domain_nl>\n\n- The natural language description of the problem:\n<problem_nl>\nYou control a set of robots that can paint floor tiles with different colors. The robots can move in four directions: up, down, left, and right. They can paint with one color at a time and can change the color of their spray guns. Tiles can only be painted in the front (up) or behind (down) the robot, and once a tile is painted, no robot can stand on it.\n\nInitially:\n- There are sixteen tiles arranged in a 4x4 grid (tile_0-1 to tile_4-4).\n- Robot1 is at tile_1-1 and has a white spray gun.\n- Robot2 is at tile_0-3 and has a black spray gun.\n- The colors white and black are available for painting.\n- All tiles are clear and unpainted except for the ones where the robots are located.\n- The tiles have directional relationships with each other, allowing the robots to move up, down, left, and right between adjacent tiles.\n\nYour goal is to paint the following tiles with the specified colors:\n- Tile tile_1-1 should be painted white.\n- Tile tile_1-2 should be painted black.\n- Tile tile_1-3 should be painted white.\n- Tile tile_1-4 should be painted black.\n- Tile tile_2-1 should be painted black.\n- Tile tile_2-2 should be painted white.\n- Tile tile_2-3 should be painted black.\n- Tile tile_2-4 should be painted white.\n- Tile tile_3-1 should be painted white.\n- Tile tile_3-2 should be painted black.\n- Tile tile_3-3 should be painted white.\n- Tile tile_3-4 should be painted black.\n- Tile tile_4-1 should be painted black.\n- Tile tile_4-2 should be painted white.\n- Tile tile_4-3 should be painted black.\n- Tile tile_4-4 should be painted white.\n\nAdditionally, you aim to minimize the total cost of the actions taken to achieve this goal.\n</problem_nl>\n\n- The PDDL problem template:\n<problem_pddl>\n(define (problem p06-442)\n (:domain floor-tile)\n (:objects tile_0-1 tile_0-2 tile_0-3 tile_0-4 \n           tile_1-1 tile_1-2 tile_1-3 tile_1-4 \n           tile_2-1 tile_2-2 tile_2-3 tile_2-4 \n           tile_3-1 tile_3-2 tile_3-3 tile_3-4 \n           tile_4-1 tile_4-2 tile_4-3 tile_4-4 -

I will provide you with:\n- A natural language description of the domain.\n- A natural language description of the problem. \n- A PDDL domain template.\n- A PDDL problem template.\n\nHere are:\n- The natural language description of the domain:\n<domain_nl>\nThe floor-tile domain is designed for planning the actions of robots to paint floor tiles with two colors. Each robot can move in four directions (up, down, right, left), change the color of paint it is carrying, and paint adjacent tiles. The domain also tracks the total cost of actions performed.\n\nThe actions defined in this domain include:\n\n1. change-color: This action allows a robot to change the color it has. The preconditions are that the robot currently has a color and the new color is available. The effect is that the robot no longer has the old color and now has the new color. This action increases the total cost by 5.\n\n2. paint-up: This action allows a robot to paint the tile above its current position. The preconditions are that the robot has a color, is at a certain tile, the tile above is clear, and the robot can move up. The effect is that the tile above is no longer clear and is now painted with the robot's color. This action increases the total cost by 2.\n\n3. paint-down: This action allows a robot to paint the tile below its current position. The preconditions are that the robot has a color, is at a certain tile, the tile below is clear, and the robot can move down. The effect is that the tile below is no longer clear and is now painted with the robot's color. This action increases the total cost by 2.\n\n4. up: This action allows a robot to move up to the tile above its current position. The preconditions are that the robot is at a certain tile, the tile above is clear, and the robot can move up. The effect is that the robot is now at the tile above, the tile it was previously at is now clear, and the tile it moved to is no longer clear. This action increases the total cost by 3.\n\n5. down: This action allows a robot to move down to the tile below its current position. The preconditions are that the robot is at a certain tile, the tile below is clear, and the robot can move down. The effect is that the robot is now at the tile below, the tile it was previously at is now clear, and the tile it moved to is no longer clear. This action increases the total cost by 1.\n\n6. right: This action allows a robot to move to the right to the tile adjacent to its current position. The preconditions are that the robot is at a certain tile, the tile to the right is clear, and the robot can move right. The effect is that the robot is now at the tile to the right, the tile it was previously at is now clear, and the tile it moved to is no longer clear. This action increases the total cost by 1.\n\n7. left: This action allows a robot to move to the left to the tile adjacent to its current position. The preconditions are that the robot is at a certain tile, the tile to the left is clear, and the robot can move left. The effect is that the robot is now at the tile to the left, the tile it was previously at is now clear, and the tile it moved to is no longer clear. This action increases the total cost by 1.\n\n</domain_nl>\n\n- The natural language description of the problem:\n<problem_nl>\nYou control a set of robots that can paint floor tiles with different colors. The robots can move in four directions: up, down, left, and right. They can paint with one color at a time and can change the color of their spray guns. Tiles can only be painted in the front (up) or behind (down) the robot, and once a tile is painted, no robot can stand on it.\n\nInitially:\n- There are eighteen tiles arranged in a 6x3 grid (tile_0-1 to tile_5-3).\n- Robot1 is at tile_3-3 and has a white spray gun.\n- Robot2 is at tile_4-1 and has a black spray gun.\n- The colors white and black are available for painting.\n- All tiles except tile_3-3 and tile_4-1 are clear and unpainted.\n- The tiles have directional relationships with each other, allowing the robots to move up, down, left, and right between adjacent tiles.\n\nYour goal is to paint the following tiles with the specified colors:\n- Tile tile_1-1 should be painted white.\n- Tile tile_1-2 should be painted black.\n- Tile tile_1-3 should be painted white.\n- Tile tile_2-1 should be painted black.\n- Tile tile_2-2 should be painted white.\n- Tile tile_2-3 should be painted black.\n- Tile tile_3-1 should be painted white.\n- Tile tile_3-2 should be painted black.\n- Tile tile_3-3 should be painted white.\n- Tile tile_4-1 should be painted black.\n- Tile tile_4-2 should be painted white.\n- Tile tile_4-3 should be painted black.\n- Tile tile_5-1 should be painted white.\n- Tile tile_5-2 should be painted black.\n- Tile tile_5-3 should be painted white.\n\nAdditionally, you aim to minimize the total cost of the actions taken to achieve this goal.\n</problem_nl>\n\n- The PDDL problem template:\n<problem_pddl>\n(define (problem p07-532)\n (:domain floor-tile)\n (:objects tile_0-1 tile_0-2 tile_0-3 \n           tile_1-1 tile_1-2 tile_1-3 \n           tile_2-1 tile_2-2 tile_2-3 \n           tile_3-1 tile_3-2 tile_3-3 \n           tile_4-1 tile_4-2 tile_4-3 \n           tile_5-1 tile_5-2 tile_5-3 -

I will provide you with:\n- A natural language description of the domain.\n- A natural language description of the problem. \n- A PDDL domain template.\n- A PDDL problem template.\n\nHere are:\n- The natural language description of the domain:\n<domain_nl>\nThe floor-tile domain is designed for planning the actions of robots to paint floor tiles with two colors. Each robot can move in four directions (up, down, right, left), change the color of paint it is carrying, and paint adjacent tiles. The domain also tracks the total cost of actions performed.\n\nThe actions defined in this domain include:\n\n1. change-color: This action allows a robot to change the color it has. The preconditions are that the robot currently has a color and the new color is available. The effect is that the robot no longer has the old color and now has the new color. This action increases the total cost by 5.\n\n2. paint-up: This action allows a robot to paint the tile above its current position. The preconditions are that the robot has a color, is at a certain tile, the tile above is clear, and the robot can move up. The effect is that the tile above is no longer clear and is now painted with the robot's color. This action increases the total cost by 2.\n\n3. paint-down: This action allows a robot to paint the tile below its current position. The preconditions are that the robot has a color, is at a certain tile, the tile below is clear, and the robot can move down. The effect is that the tile below is no longer clear and is now painted with the robot's color. This action increases the total cost by 2.\n\n4. up: This action allows a robot to move up to the tile above its current position. The preconditions are that the robot is at a certain tile, the tile above is clear, and the robot can move up. The effect is that the robot is now at the tile above, the tile it was previously at is now clear, and the tile it moved to is no longer clear. This action increases the total cost by 3.\n\n5. down: This action allows a robot to move down to the tile below its current position. The preconditions are that the robot is at a certain tile, the tile below is clear, and the robot can move down. The effect is that the robot is now at the tile below, the tile it was previously at is now clear, and the tile it moved to is no longer clear. This action increases the total cost by 1.\n\n6. right: This action allows a robot to move to the right to the tile adjacent to its current position. The preconditions are that the robot is at a certain tile, the tile to the right is clear, and the robot can move right. The effect is that the robot is now at the tile to the right, the tile it was previously at is now clear, and the tile it moved to is no longer clear. This action increases the total cost by 1.\n\n7. left: This action allows a robot to move to the left to the tile adjacent to its current position. The preconditions are that the robot is at a certain tile, the tile to the left is clear, and the robot can move left. The effect is that the robot is now at the tile to the left, the tile it was previously at is now clear, and the tile it moved to is no longer clear.

Each robot can move in four directions (up, down, right, left), change the color of paint it is carrying, and paint adjacent tiles. The domain also tracks the total cost of actions performed.\n\nThe actions defined in this domain include:\n\n1. change-color: This action allows a robot to change the color it has. The preconditions are that the robot currently has a color and the new color is available. The effect is that the robot no longer has the old color and now has the new color. This action increases the total cost by 5.\n\n2. paint-up: This action allows a robot to paint the tile above its current position. The preconditions are that the robot has a color, is at a certain tile, the tile above is clear, and the robot can move up. The effect is that the tile above is no longer clear and is now painted with the robot's color. This action increases the total cost by 2.\n\n3. paint-down: This action allows a robot to paint the tile below its current position. The preconditions are that the robot has a color, is at a certain tile, the tile below is clear, and the robot can move down. The effect is that the tile below is no longer clear and is now painted with the robot's color. This action increases the total cost by 2.\n\n4. up: This action allows a robot to move up to the tile above its current position. The preconditions are that the robot is at a certain tile, the tile above is clear, and the robot can move up. The effect is that the robot is now at the tile above, the tile it was previously at is now clear, and the tile it moved to is no longer clear. This action increases the total cost by 3.\n\n5. down: This action allows a robot to move down to the tile below its current position. The preconditions are that the robot is at a certain tile, the tile below is clear, and the robot can move down. The effect is that the robot is now at the tile below, the tile it was previously at is now clear, and the tile it moved to is no longer clear. This action increases the total cost by 1.\n\n6. right: This action allows a robot to move to the right to the tile adjacent to its current position. The preconditions are that the robot is at a certain tile, the tile to the right is clear, and the robot can move right. The effect is that the robot is now at the tile to the right, the tile it was previously at is now clear, and the tile it moved to is no longer clear. This action increases the total cost by 1.\n\n7. left: This action allows a robot to move to the left to the tile adjacent to its current position. The preconditions are that the robot is at a certain tile, the tile to the left is clear, and the robot can move left. The effect is that the robot is now at the tile to the left, the tile it was previously at is now clear, and the tile it moved to is no longer clear.

I will provide you with:\n- A natural language description of the domain.\n- A natural language description of the problem. \n- A PDDL domain template.\n- A PDDL problem template.\n\nHere are:\n- The natural language description of the domain:\n<domain_nl>\nThe floor-tile domain is designed for planning the actions of robots to paint floor tiles with two colors. Each robot can move in four directions (up, down, right, left), change the color of paint it is carrying, and paint adjacent tiles. The domain also tracks the total cost of actions performed.\n\nThe actions defined in this domain include:\n\n1. change-color: This action allows a robot to change the color it has. The preconditions are that the robot currently has a color and the new color is available. The effect is that the robot no longer has the old color and now has the new color. This action increases the total cost by 5.\n\n2. paint-up: This action allows a robot to paint the tile above its current position. The preconditions are that the robot has a color, is at a certain tile, the tile above is clear, and the robot can move up. The effect is that the tile above is no longer clear and is now painted with the robot's color. This action increases the total cost by 2.\n\n3. paint-down: This action allows a robot to paint the tile below its current position. The preconditions are that the robot has a color, is at a certain tile, the tile below is clear, and the robot can move down. The effect is that the tile below is no longer clear and is now painted with the robot's color. This action increases the total cost by 2.\n\n4. up: This action allows a robot to move up to the tile above its current position. The preconditions are that the robot is at a certain tile, the tile above is clear, and the robot can move up. The effect is that the robot is now at the tile above, the tile it was previously at is now clear, and the tile it moved to is no longer clear. This action increases the total cost by 3.\n\n5. down: This action allows a robot to move down to the tile below its current position. The preconditions are that the robot is at a certain tile, the tile below is clear, and the robot can move down. The effect is that the robot is now at the tile below, the tile it was previously at is now clear, and the tile it moved to is no longer clear. This action increases the total cost by 1.\n\n6. right: This action allows a robot to move to the right to the tile adjacent to its current position. The preconditions are that the robot is at a certain tile, the tile to the right is clear, and the robot can move right. The effect is that the robot is now at the tile to the right, the tile it was previously at is now clear, and the tile it moved to is no longer clear. This action increases the total cost by 1.\n\n7. left: This action allows a robot to move to the left to the tile adjacent to its current position. The preconditions are that the robot is at a certain tile, the tile to the left is clear, and the robot can move left. The effect is that the robot is now at the tile to the left, the tile it was previously at is now clear, and the tile it moved to is no longer clear. This action increases the total cost by 1.\n\n</domain_nl>\n\n- The natural language description of the problem:\n<problem_nl>\nYou control two robots that can paint floor tiles with different colors. The robots can move in four directions: up, down, left, and right. They can paint with one color at a time and can change the color of their spray guns. Tiles can only be painted in the front (up) or behind (down) the robot, and once a tile is painted, no robot can stand on it.\n\nInitially:\n- There are twenty-four tiles arranged in a 6x4 grid (tile_0-1 to tile_5-4).\n- Robot1 is at tile_1-3 and has a white spray gun.\n- Robot2 is at tile_1-1 and has a black spray gun.\n- The colors white and black are available for painting.\n- All tiles are clear and unpainted.\n- The tiles have directional relationships with each other, allowing the robots to move up, down, left, and right between adjacent tiles.\n\nYour goal is to paint the following tiles with the specified colors:\n- Tile tile_1-1 should be painted white.\n- Tile tile_1-2 should be painted black.\n- Tile tile_1-3 should be painted white.\n- Tile tile_1-4 should be painted black.\n- Tile tile_2-1 should be painted black.\n- Tile tile_2-2 should be painted white.\n- Tile tile_2-3 should be painted black.\n- Tile tile_2-4 should be painted white.\n- Tile tile_3-1 should be painted white.\n- Tile tile_3-2 should be painted black.\n- Tile tile_3-3 should be painted white.\n- Tile tile_3-4 should be painted black.\n- Tile tile_4-1 should be painted black.\n- Tile tile_4-2 should be painted white.\n- Tile tile_4-3 should be painted black.\n- Tile tile_4-4 should be painted white.\n- Tile tile_5-1 should be painted white.\n- Tile tile_5-2 should be painted black.\n- Tile tile_5-3 should be painted white.\n- Tile tile_5-4 should be painted black.\n\nAdditionally, you aim to minimize the total cost of the actions taken to achieve this goal.\n</problem_nl>\n\n- The PDDL problem template:\n<problem_pddl>\n(define (problem p10-542)\n (:domain floor-tile)\n (:objects tile_0-1 tile_0-2 tile_0-3 tile_0-4 \n           tile_1-1 tile_1-2 tile_1-3 tile_1-4 \n           tile_2-1 tile_2-2 tile_2-3 tile_2-4 \n           tile_3-1 tile_3-2 tile_3-3 tile_3-4 \n           tile_4-1 tile_4-2 tile_4-3 tile_4-4 \n           tile_5-1 tile_5-2 tile_5-3 tile_5-4 -
