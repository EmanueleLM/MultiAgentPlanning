LEFT (b) and RIGHT (a) are empty — this satisfies the specification’s required final configuration (middle peg holds A..G).\n\nNotes:\n- I followed the plan exactly, step-for-step, without adding or removing any actions.\n- I used one time unit per move (t = step number, duration = 1) as a simple timestamp/duration convention as requested.\n- If you need the explicit top-to-bottom contents after every intermediate step, I can generate the full stack contents for each timestamp (this will be a very long list), but the final state above confirms the plan achieves the specified goal.",

From smallest to largest they are disk A, disk B, disk C, disk D, disk E, disk F, and disk G.\nAs initial conditions I have that, the left peg holds, from top to bottom, disk A, disk B, disk C, disk D, disk E, disk F, and disk G, while the right peg and the middle peg are empty.\nMy goal is to have that the middle peg holds, from top to bottom, disk A, disk B, disk C, disk D, disk E, disk F, and disk G, and both the left peg and the right peg are empty again.\nThe right peg can be used as an intermediate parking spot but must end up empty.\n\nMy plan is as follows:\n\n[PLAN]",
