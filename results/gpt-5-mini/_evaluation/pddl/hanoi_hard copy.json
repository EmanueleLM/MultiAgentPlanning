      "prompt_0shot": "I am practicing the Tower of Hanoi puzzle. Here is the action I can do\n\nMove the top disk from one peg to another peg\n\nI must obey the following rules:\nI can move only one disk at a time.\nI may only move a disk that is on top of a peg.\nI can never place a larger disk on top of a smaller disk.\nOnce a disk is moved, it keeps its relative size ordering with the others.\n\n[STATEMENT]\nThere are 6 disks in total. From smallest to largest they are disk A, disk B, disk C, disk D, disk E, and disk F.\nAs initial conditions I have that, the right peg holds, from top to bottom, disk A, disk B, disk C, disk D, disk E, and disk F, while the left peg and the middle peg are empty.\nMy goal is to have that the middle peg holds, from top to bottom, disk A, disk B, disk C, disk D, disk E, and disk F, and both the right peg and the left peg are empty again.\nThe left peg can be used as an intermediate parking spot but must end up empty.\n\nMy plan is as follows:\n\n[PLAN]",
