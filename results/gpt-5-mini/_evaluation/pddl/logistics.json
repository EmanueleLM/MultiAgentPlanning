If you map stages to integer timestamps, you can view step N as occurring at timestamp stage_{N-1} (first action at stage_0, last at stage_14). Each action here is treated as occupying one stage token; duration per action = 1 stage (unit).\n\nThis sequence matches the provided plan exactly, preserves the action order and grounded arguments, and shows the causal preconditions/effects that produce the three goal next(...) predicates.",

I treated each transition as one time unit.  \n- Several objects temporarily held multiple next relations concurrently (e.g., object_4 had next to object_11 and object_10 at the same time between steps).

(next object_11 object_8) — produced at step 11\n  - (next object_12 object_8) — produced at step 8\n  - (next object_13 object_10) — produced at step 16\n  These match the goal: (next object_11 object_8), (next object_12 object_8), (next object_13 object_10).\n\nTiming / cost:\n- I used 1 time unit per action following the stage succession; total plan duration = 16 time units.\n- Plan cost reported in the PDDL was 16 (unit cost), consistent with one unit per action.\n\nIf you would like, I can:\n- Produce a compact machine-friendly list (same sequence) with only action names + parameters + timestamps.\n- Produce an auditor-style causal consistency report (but no causal violations were found).",

You can interpret each action as taking one time unit between the indicated stages.\n\nNotes / small remarks (compliance and assumptions)\n- I used the domain semantics given in the PDDL: memory swaps a next link from ?o1 to ?o2 for a cats object, sip creates a vase and removes a next link, paltry uses a vase and a next link to create a new next link and remove the vase. All preconditions were satisfied at their execution timestamps.\n- No extra actions were added or removed; the sequence and timestamps match exactly the provided plan.\n\nConclusion: The provided plan, executed in the given order with stage transitions s0→s1→s2→s3→s4, is valid under the given initial facts and achieves the goal (next object_8 object_7) and (next object_9 object_6).",

Time is reported as integer stages t0..t11; each action consumes one stage (tN → tN+1) and moves the enabled token from sN to sN+1. For each step I show the action (agent-attributed name and parameters), the time window, the minimal preconditions relied on (from the domain), and the effect summary (what next/vase facts are added and what next/vase facts are removed). After the final step the combined goals are satisfied:\n- next object_10 object_6\n- next object_9 object_6\n- next object_10 object_7\n- next object_11 object_8\n\nStep 1\n- Action: wretched_playera object_4 object_6 object_5 object_1\n- Agent / stage: player_a, s0 → s1 (t0 → t1)\n- Key preconditions used: sneeze(object_4), texture(object_6), texture(object_5), stupendous(object_1), next(object_4,object_6), collect(object_6,object_1), collect(object_5,object_1)\n- Effects (applied): add next(object_4,object_5); delete next(object_4,object_6)\n\nStep 2\n- Action: clip_playera object_10 object_4 object_5\n- Agent / stage: player_a, s1 → s2 (t1 → t2)\n- Key preconditions used: hand(object_10), sneeze(object_4), texture(object_5), next(object_4,object_5), next(object_10,object_5)\n- Effects (applied): add vase(object_10,object_4); delete next(object_10,object_5)\n\nStep 3\n- Action: wretched_playera object_4 object_8 object_7 object_2\n- Agent / stage: player_a, s2 → s3 (t2 → t3)\n- Key preconditions used: sneeze(object_4), texture(object_8), texture(object_7), stupendous(object_2), next(object_4,object_8), collect(object_8,object_2), collect(object_7,object_2)\n- Effects (applied): add next(object_4,object_7); delete next(object_4,object_8)\n\nStep 4\n- Action: tightfisted_playera object_10 object_4 object_7\n- Agent / stage: player_a, s3 → s4 (t3 → t4)\n- Key preconditions used: hand(object_10), sneeze(object_4), texture(object_7), next(object_4,object_7), vase(object_10,object_4)\n- Effects (applied): add next(object_10,object_7); delete vase(object_10,object_4)\n\nStep 5\n- Action: clip_playera object_9 object_4 object_5\n- Agent / stage: player_a, s4 → s5 (t4 → t5)\n- Key preconditions used: hand(object_9), sneeze(object_4), texture(object_5), next(object_4,object_5), next(object_9,object_5)\n- Effects (applied): add vase(object_9,object_4); delete next(object_9,object_5)\n\nStep 6\n- Action: wretched_playera object_4 object_7 object_6 object_2\n- Agent / stage: player_a, s5 → s6 (t5 → t6)\n- Key preconditions used: sneeze(object_4), texture(object_7), texture(object_6), stupendous(object_2), next(object_4,object_7), collect(object_7,object_2), collect(object_6,object_2)\n- Effects (applied): add next(object_4,object_6); delete next(object_4,object_7)\n\nStep 7\n- Action: tightfisted_playera object_9 object_4 object_6\n- Agent / stage: player_a, s6 → s7 (t6 → t7)\n- Key preconditions used: hand(object_9), sneeze(object_4), texture(object_6), next(object_4,object_6), vase(object_9,object_4)\n- Effects (applied): add next(object_9,object_6); delete vase(object_9,object_4)\n\nStep 8\n- Action: wretched_playera object_5 object_8 object_9 object_3\n- Agent / stage: player_a, s7 → s8 (t7 → t8)\n- Key preconditions used: sneeze(object_5), texture(object_8), texture(object_9), stupendous(object_3), next(object_5,object_8), collect(object_8,object_3), collect(object_9,object_3)\n- Effects (applied): add next(object_5,object_9); delete next(object_5,object_8)\n\nStep 9\n- Action: clip_playera object_11 object_5 object_9\n- Agent / stage: player_a, s8 → s9 (t8 → t9)\n- Key preconditions used: hand(object_11), sneeze(object_5), texture(object_9), next(object_5,object_9), next(object_11,object_9)\n- Effects (applied): add vase(object_11,object_5); delete next(object_11,object_9)\n\nStep 10\n- Action: wretched_playera object_5 object_9 object_8 object_3\n- Agent / stage: player_a, s9 → s10 (t9 → t10)\n- Key preconditions used: sneeze(object_5), texture(object_9), texture(object_8), stupendous(object_3), next(object_5,object_9), collect(object_9,object_3), collect(object_8,object_3)\n- Effects (applied): add next(object_5,object_8); delete next(object_5,object_9)\n\nStep 11\n- Action: tightfisted_playera object_11 object_5 object_8\n- Agent / stage: player_a, s10 → s11 (t10 → t11)\n- Key preconditions used: hand(object_11), sneeze(object_5), texture(object_8), next(object_5,object_8), vase(object_11,object_5)\n- Effects (applied): add next(object_11,object_8); delete vase(object_11,object_5)\n\nFinal state (relevant facts)\n- next(object_10,object_6): true (present from initial state and never deleted)\n- next(object_9,object_6): true (added at Step 7)\n- next(object_10,object_7): true (added at Step 4)\n- next(object_11,object_8): true (added at Step 11)\n\nConclusion: The plan as executed (steps 1–11, t0 → t11) is exactly the provided plan and yields the required goal conjunction: next object_10 object_6, next object_9 object_6, next object_10 object_7, and next object_11 object_8.",
