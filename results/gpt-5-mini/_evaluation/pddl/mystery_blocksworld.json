Each stage transition is a single discrete time step.\n\n1) Time s0 → s1\n- Action: attacker-attack(c, b)\n- Agent: attacker\n- Preconditions required: province(c), planet(b), harmony\n- Immediate effects: remove province(c), remove planet(b), remove harmony, add pain\n- Note: At s0 the initial state contained province(c), planet(b), and harmony, so the attack is valid.

Thus the attack is applicable and produces pain while removing province(d), planet(d), and harmony.\n\n4) Time s3 → s4\n- Action: succumber-succumb(c, a)\n- Agent: succumber\n- Preconditions required: pain\n- Immediate effects: remove pain, add harmony, add province(c), add planet(a)\n- Note: Step 3 created pain, so at s3 succumbing is allowed. This restores harmony and re-establishes province(c) and planet(a) as specified.\n\n5) Time s4 → s5\n- Action: feaster-feast(c, a)\n- Agent: feaster\n- Preconditions required: craves(c, a), province(c), harmony\n- Immediate effects: add pain, add province(a), remove craves(c, a), remove province(c), remove harmony\n- Note: The initial state had craves(c,a). Step 4 re-created province(c) and harmony, so feasting is applicable at s4. The result sets pain true, grants province(a), and removes the craves(c,a), province(c), and harmony.\n\n6) Time s5 → s6\n- Action: succumber-succumb(b, a)\n- Agent: succumber\n- Preconditions required: pain\n- Immediate effects: remove pain, add harmony, add province(b), add planet(a)\n- Note: Step 5 produced pain, so succumbing at s5 is allowed. This restores harmony, re-creates province(b), and ensures planet(a) (planet(a) may already exist from prior steps but is (re)asserted).\n\n7) Time s6 → s7\n- Action: attacker-attack(a, a)\n- Agent: attacker\n- Preconditions required: province(a), planet(a), harmony\n- Immediate effects: remove province(a), remove planet(a), remove harmony, add pain\n- Note: After step 6 province(a) and planet(a) are present and harmony exists, so the attacker can attack with p=a, pl=a. This produces pain and removes those facts.\n\n8) Time s7 → s8\n- Action: succumber-succumb(c, a)\n- Agent: succumber\n- Preconditions required: pain\n- Immediate effects: remove pain, add harmony, add province(c), add planet(a)\n- Note: Step 7 produced pain, so succumb is applicable at s7. This restores harmony and province(c) (and (re)asserts planet(a)).\n\n9) Time s8 → s9\n- Action: attacker-attack(b, a)\n- Agent: attacker\n- Preconditions required: province(b), planet(a), harmony\n- Immediate effects: remove province(b), remove planet(a), remove harmony, add pain\n- Note: After step 8 province(b) existed (from step 6) and planet(a) and harmony exist, so attacker-attack(b,a) at s8 is valid.

This makes pain true, grants province(d), and removes craves(a,d), province(a), and harmony.\n\n14) Time s13 → s14\n- Action: succumber-succumb(a, a)\n- Agent: succumber\n- Preconditions required: pain\n- Immediate effects: remove pain, add harmony, add province(a), add planet(a)\n- Note: Step 13 produced pain, so succumbing at s13 is allowed. This restores harmony and province(a) and planet(a).\n\n15) Time s14 → s15\n- Action: attacker-attack(d, a)\n- Agent: attacker\n- Preconditions required: province(d), planet(a), harmony\n- Immediate effects: remove province(d), remove planet(a), remove harmony, add pain\n- Note: At s14 province(d) was created in step 13 and planet(a) and harmony were restored in step 14, so attacker-attack(d,a) is applicable and produces pain while removing those facts.\n\n16) Time s15 → s16\n- Action: overcomer-overcome(c, a)\n- Agent: overcomer\n- Preconditions required: province(a), pain\n- Immediate effects: add harmony, add province(c), add craves(c, a), remove province(a), remove pain\n- Note: Step 15 created pain and province(a) existed at s15, so overcomer can create craves(c,a) and province(c) at the final transition while removing province(a) and pain.\n\nFinal state at time s16 (after step 16)\n- The goal fluents are satisfied:\n  - craves(a, b) — created in step 12 (overcomer-overcome(a, b))\n  - craves(c, a) — (re)established in the final step 16 (overcomer-overcome(c, a))\n  - craves(d, c) — created earlier in step 10 (overcomer-overcome(d, c))\n- Therefore the goal (craves a b) ∧ (craves c a) ∧ (craves d c) holds at s16.\n\nTiming note: each listed action is the discrete transition from stage sN to sN+1; treat each transition as a single time step.
