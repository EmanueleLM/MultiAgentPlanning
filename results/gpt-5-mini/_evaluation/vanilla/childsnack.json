making a sandwich removes notexist and adds in_kitchen for that sandwich.\n- Serving actions require the tray to be at the same place where the child is waiting and require allergy checks: allergic children must be served via serve_sandwich_no_gluten (which requires a no_gluten_sandwich). Non-allergic children require the not_allergic_gluten predicate.\n- Trays move with move_tray and put_on_tray requires the tray to be at the kitchen.\n\nYou can run FastDownward (or other PDDL planners supporting basic STRIPS with typed objects and negative effects) with these domain and problem files to find a plan that serves all six children without violating allergy constraints.",

The domain includes actions for making sandwiches with and without gluten, placing sandwiches on trays, moving trays between places, and serving the sandwiches to the children.\n\nThe actions defined in this domain include:\n\n1. make_sandwich_no_gluten: This action is for making a gluten-free sandwich. The preconditions for this action are that there must be gluten-free bread and gluten-free content available in the kitchen, and the sandwich must not already exist. The effect of this action is that the gluten-free bread and content are no longer available in the kitchen, and a gluten-free sandwich is now available in the kitchen.\n\n2. make_sandwich: This action is for making a regular sandwich that may contain gluten. The preconditions are that there must be bread and content available in the kitchen, and the sandwich must not already exist. The effect of this action is that the bread and content are no longer available in the kitchen, and a sandwich is now available in the kitchen.\n\n3. put_on_tray: This action is for placing a sandwich on a tray. The preconditions are that the sandwich must be in the kitchen and the tray must be at the kitchen. The effect is that the sandwich is no longer in the kitchen and is now on the tray.\n\n4. serve_sandwich_no_gluten: This action is for serving a gluten-free sandwich to a child who is allergic to gluten. The preconditions are that the child is allergic to gluten, waiting at a place, and there is a gluten-free sandwich on a tray at the same place. The effect is that the sandwich is no longer on the tray and the child is served.\n\n5. serve_sandwich: This action is for serving a sandwich to a child who is not allergic to gluten. The preconditions are that the child is not allergic to gluten, waiting at a place, and there is a sandwich on a tray at the same place. The effect is that the sandwich is no longer on the tray and the child is served.\n\n6. move_tray: This action allows a tray to be moved from one place to another. The precondition is that the tray is at the starting place. The effect is that the tray is no longer at the starting place and is now at the destination place.\n\n</domain_nl>\n\n- The natural language description of the problem:\n<problem_nl>\nYou are tasked with preparing and serving sandwiches to twelve children, some of whom have gluten allergies, using a set of actions that involve making sandwiches, placing them on trays, moving trays, and serving the sandwiches.\n\nInitially:\n- There are three trays, tray1, tray2, and tray3, all located in the kitchen.\n- There are twelve portions of bread, bread1 through bread12, all in the kitchen.\n- There are twelve portions of content, content1 through content12, all in the kitchen.\n- Bread portions bread3, bread4, bread5, and bread11 are gluten-free.\n- Content portions content2, content5, content9, and content12 are gluten-free.\n- Child1, child3, child5, and child12 are allergic to gluten.\n- Child2, child4, child6, child7, child8, child9, child10, and child11 are not allergic to gluten.\n- Child1 and child4 are waiting at table2.\n- Child2, child3, child9, child11, and child12 are waiting at table1.\n- Child5, child6, child7, and child10 are waiting at table3.\n- Child8 is waiting at table2.\n- There are sixteen sandwiches, sandw1 through sandw16, which do not exist yet.\n\nYour goal is to ensure that:\n- All twelve children, child1 through child12, are served with a sandwich that they are not allergic to.\n</problem_nl>\n\n- The PDDL problem template:\n<problem_pddl>\n;

The domain includes actions for making sandwiches with and without gluten, placing sandwiches on trays, moving trays between places, and serving the sandwiches to the children.\n\nThe actions defined in this domain include:\n\n1. make_sandwich_no_gluten: This action is for making a gluten-free sandwich. The preconditions for this action are that there must be gluten-free bread and gluten-free content available in the kitchen, and the sandwich must not already exist. The effect of this action is that the gluten-free bread and content are no longer available in the kitchen, and a gluten-free sandwich is now available in the kitchen.\n\n2. make_sandwich: This action is for making a regular sandwich that may contain gluten. The preconditions are that there must be bread and content available in the kitchen, and the sandwich must not already exist. The effect of this action is that the bread and content are no longer available in the kitchen, and a sandwich is now available in the kitchen.\n\n3. put_on_tray: This action is for placing a sandwich on a tray. The preconditions are that the sandwich must be in the kitchen and the tray must be at the kitchen. The effect is that the sandwich is no longer in the kitchen and is now on the tray.\n\n4. serve_sandwich_no_gluten: This action is for serving a gluten-free sandwich to a child who is allergic to gluten. The preconditions are that the child is allergic to gluten, waiting at a place, and there is a gluten-free sandwich on a tray at the same place. The effect is that the sandwich is no longer on the tray and the child is served.\n\n5. serve_sandwich: This action is for serving a sandwich to a child who is not allergic to gluten. The preconditions are that the child is not allergic to gluten, waiting at a place, and there is a sandwich on a tray at the same place. The effect is that the sandwich is no longer on the tray and the child is served.\n\n6. move_tray: This action allows a tray to be moved from one place to another. The precondition is that the tray is at the starting place. The effect is that the tray is no longer at the starting place and is now at the destination place.\n\n</domain_nl>\n\n- The natural language description of the problem:\n<problem_nl>\nYou are tasked with preparing and serving sandwiches to twelve children, some of whom have gluten allergies, using a set of actions that involve making sandwiches, placing them on trays, moving trays, and serving the sandwiches.\n\nInitially:\n- There are three trays, tray1, tray2, and tray3, all located in the kitchen.\n- There are twelve portions of bread, bread1 through bread12, all in the kitchen.\n- There are twelve portions of content, content1 through content12, all in the kitchen.\n- Bread portions bread7, bread3, bread10, and bread9 are gluten-free.\n- Content portions content6, content8, content3, and content2 are gluten-free.\n- Child8, child9, child3, and child4 are allergic to gluten.\n- Child12, child1, child2, child11, child5, child6, child7, and child10 are not allergic to gluten.\n- Child1, child2, child3, child7, child10, and child12 are waiting at table1.\n- Child5, child6, child8, child9, and child11 are waiting at table2.\n- Child4 is waiting at table3.\n- There are sixteen sandwiches, sandw1 through sandw16, which do not exist yet.\n\nYour goal is to ensure that:\n- All twelve children, child1 through child12, are served with a sandwich that they are not allergic to.\n</problem_nl>\n\n- The PDDL problem template:\n<problem_pddl>\n;

that action marks the sandwich as (glutenfree ?s). Regular make_sandwich does not mark glutenfree.\n- The serve_sandwich_no_gluten action requires the sandwich to be marked glutenfree and the child to be allergic. The serve_sandwich action requires the child to be not_allergic_gluten. (Non-allergic children may also be served a glutenfree sandwich because a glutenfree sandwich satisfies the on_tray precondition and a not_allergic_gluten child meets the serve_sandwich precondition.)\n- Trays carry sandwiches (on_tray), and the tray location (at) is moved by move_tray. Serve actions require the tray to be at the child's place.\n\nYou can run Fast Downward with these domain and problem files. If you want, I can also produce a sample plan (greedy plan) or tune the encoding further (e.g., allow constructing sandwiches directly on trays) to speed up solving.",

The domain includes actions for making sandwiches with and without gluten, placing sandwiches on trays, moving trays between places, and serving the sandwiches to the children.\n\nThe actions defined in this domain include:\n\n1. make_sandwich_no_gluten: This action is for making a gluten-free sandwich. The preconditions for this action are that there must be gluten-free bread and gluten-free content available in the kitchen, and the sandwich must not already exist. The effect of this action is that the gluten-free bread and content are no longer available in the kitchen, and a gluten-free sandwich is now available in the kitchen.\n\n2. make_sandwich: This action is for making a regular sandwich that may contain gluten. The preconditions are that there must be bread and content available in the kitchen, and the sandwich must not already exist. The effect of this action is that the bread and content are no longer available in the kitchen, and a sandwich is now available in the kitchen.\n\n3. put_on_tray: This action is for placing a sandwich on a tray. The preconditions are that the sandwich must be in the kitchen and the tray must be at the kitchen. The effect is that the sandwich is no longer in the kitchen and is now on the tray.\n\n4. serve_sandwich_no_gluten: This action is for serving a gluten-free sandwich to a child who is allergic to gluten. The preconditions are that the child is allergic to gluten, waiting at a place, and there is a gluten-free sandwich on a tray at the same place. The effect is that the sandwich is no longer on the tray and the child is served.\n\n5. serve_sandwich: This action is for serving a sandwich to a child who is not allergic to gluten. The preconditions are that the child is not allergic to gluten, waiting at a place, and there is a sandwich on a tray at the same place. The effect is that the sandwich is no longer on the tray and the child is served.\n\n6. move_tray: This action allows a tray to be moved from one place to another.

its effect marks the created sandwich as gluten_free.\n- make_sandwich consumes a bread and a content and creates a kitchen sandwich (not marked gluten_free).\n- put_on_tray moves a kitchen sandwich onto a tray that is at the kitchen.\n- move_tray relocates a tray to any place (e.g., table1/2/3).\n- serve_sandwich_no_gluten requires the child to be allergic and the sandwich to be gluten_free; serve_sandwich requires the child to be non-allergic. Both consume the sandwich (re-mark it notexist) and mark the child served so sandwiches are not reused.\n- All predicates used in the problem file are declared in the domain.\n\nIf you want, I can:\n- produce a sample plan (a possible action sequence) for this specific instance,\n- or adjust modeling choices (for example, allow make_sandwich to create gluten-free sandwiches automatically when both ingredients are gluten-free), or\n- add cost or optimize plan length constraints for Fast-Downward.",

The domain includes actions for making sandwiches with and without gluten, placing sandwiches on trays, moving trays between places, and serving the sandwiches to the children.\n\nThe actions defined in this domain include:\n\n1. make_sandwich_no_gluten: This action is for making a gluten-free sandwich. The preconditions for this action are that there must be gluten-free bread and gluten-free content available in the kitchen, and the sandwich must not already exist. The effect of this action is that the gluten-free bread and content are no longer available in the kitchen, and a gluten-free sandwich is now available in the kitchen.\n\n2. make_sandwich: This action is for making a regular sandwich that may contain gluten. The preconditions are that there must be bread and content available in the kitchen, and the sandwich must not already exist. The effect of this action is that the bread and content are no longer available in the kitchen, and a sandwich is now available in the kitchen.\n\n3. put_on_tray: This action is for placing a sandwich on a tray. The preconditions are that the sandwich must be in the kitchen and the tray must be at the kitchen. The effect is that the sandwich is no longer in the kitchen and is now on the tray.\n\n4. serve_sandwich_no_gluten: This action is for serving a gluten-free sandwich to a child who is allergic to gluten. The preconditions are that the child is allergic to gluten, waiting at a place, and there is a gluten-free sandwich on a tray at the same place. The effect is that the sandwich is no longer on the tray and the child is served.\n\n5. serve_sandwich: This action is for serving a sandwich to a child who is not allergic to gluten. The preconditions are that the child is not allergic to gluten, waiting at a place, and there is a sandwich on a tray at the same place. The effect is that the sandwich is no longer on the tray and the child is served.\n\n6. move_tray: This action allows a tray to be moved from one place to another. The precondition is that the tray is at the starting place. The effect is that the tray is no longer at the starting place and is now at the destination place.\n\n</domain_nl>\n\n- The natural language description of the problem:\n<problem_nl>\nYou are tasked with preparing and serving sandwiches to thirteen children, some of whom have gluten allergies, using a set of actions that involve making sandwiches, placing them on trays, moving trays, and serving the sandwiches.\n\nInitially:\n- There are three trays, tray1, tray2, and tray3, all located in the kitchen.\n- There are thirteen portions of bread, bread1 through bread13, all in the kitchen.\n- There are thirteen portions of content, content1 through content13, all in the kitchen.\n- Bread portions bread3, bread5, bread8, bread10, and bread11 are gluten-free.\n- Content portions content3, content7, content9, content11, and content12 are gluten-free.\n- Child1, child2, child3, child11, and child12 are allergic to gluten.\n- Child4, child5, child6, child7, child8, child9, child10, and child13 are not allergic to gluten.\n- Child1 is waiting at table3.\n- Child2, child3, child5, child6, and child8 are waiting at table2.\n- Child4, child7, child9, and child10 are waiting at table1.\n- Child11 and child12 are waiting at table3.\n- Child13 is waiting at table2.\n- There are seventeen sandwiches, sandw1 through sandw17, which do not exist yet.\n\nYour goal is to ensure that:\n- All thirteen children, child1 through child13, are served with a sandwich that they are not allergic to.\n</problem_nl>\n\n- The PDDL problem template:\n<problem_pddl>\n;

The domain includes actions for making sandwiches with and without gluten, placing sandwiches on trays, moving trays between places, and serving the sandwiches to the children.\n\nThe actions defined in this domain include:\n\n1. make_sandwich_no_gluten: This action is for making a gluten-free sandwich. The preconditions for this action are that there must be gluten-free bread and gluten-free content available in the kitchen, and the sandwich must not already exist. The effect of this action is that the gluten-free bread and content are no longer available in the kitchen, and a gluten-free sandwich is now available in the kitchen.\n\n2. make_sandwich: This action is for making a regular sandwich that may contain gluten. The preconditions are that there must be bread and content available in the kitchen, and the sandwich must not already exist. The effect of this action is that the bread and content are no longer available in the kitchen, and a sandwich is now available in the kitchen.\n\n3. put_on_tray: This action is for placing a sandwich on a tray. The preconditions are that the sandwich must be in the kitchen and the tray must be at the kitchen. The effect is that the sandwich is no longer in the kitchen and is now on the tray.\n\n4. serve_sandwich_no_gluten: This action is for serving a gluten-free sandwich to a child who is allergic to gluten. The preconditions are that the child is allergic to gluten, waiting at a place, and there is a gluten-free sandwich on a tray at the same place. The effect is that the sandwich is no longer on the tray and the child is served.\n\n5. serve_sandwich: This action is for serving a sandwich to a child who is not allergic to gluten. The preconditions are that the child is not allergic to gluten, waiting at a place, and there is a sandwich on a tray at the same place. The effect is that the sandwich is no longer on the tray and the child is served.\n\n6. move_tray: This action allows a tray to be moved from one place to another. The precondition is that the tray is at the starting place. The effect is that the tray is no longer at the starting place and is now at the destination place.\n\n</domain_nl>\n\n- The natural language description of the problem:\n<problem_nl>\nYou are tasked with preparing and serving sandwiches to fourteen children, some of whom have gluten allergies, using a set of actions that involve making sandwiches, placing them on trays, moving trays, and serving the sandwiches.\n\nInitially:\n- There are three trays, tray1, tray2, and tray3, all located in the kitchen.\n- There are fourteen portions of bread, bread1 through bread14, all in the kitchen.\n- There are fourteen portions of content, content1 through content14, all in the kitchen.\n- Bread portions bread3, bread13, bread5, bread6, and bread2 are gluten-free.\n- Content portions content12, content7, content2, content11, and content5 are gluten-free.\n- Children child8, child1, child4, child5, and child14 are allergic to gluten.\n- Children child12, child13, child2, child3, child6, child7, child9, child10, and child11 are not allergic to gluten.\n- Child1 is waiting at table2.\n- Child2 and child3 are waiting at table3.\n- Child4 is waiting at table3.\n- Child5 is waiting at table2.\n- Child6, child9, child11, child12, and child13 are waiting at table1.\n- Child7 and child10 are waiting at table3.\n- Child8 and child14 are waiting at table1.\n- There are nineteen sandwiches, sandw1 through sandw19, which do not exist yet.\n\nYour goal is to ensure that:\n- All fourteen children, child1 through child14, are served with a sandwich that they are not allergic to.\n</problem_nl>\n\n- The PDDL problem template:\n<problem_pddl>\n; child-snack task with 14 children and 0.4 gluten factor \n; constant factor of 1.3\n; random seed: 234324\n\n(define (problem prob-snack)\n  (:domain child-snack)\n  (:objects\n    child1 child2 child3 child4 child5 child6 child7 child8 child9 child10 child11 child12 child13 child14 -

The domain includes actions for making sandwiches with and without gluten, placing sandwiches on trays, moving trays between places, and serving the sandwiches to the children.\n\nThe actions defined in this domain include:\n\n1. make_sandwich_no_gluten: This action is for making a gluten-free sandwich. The preconditions for this action are that there must be gluten-free bread and gluten-free content available in the kitchen, and the sandwich must not already exist. The effect of this action is that the gluten-free bread and content are no longer available in the kitchen, and a gluten-free sandwich is now available in the kitchen.\n\n2. make_sandwich: This action is for making a regular sandwich that may contain gluten. The preconditions are that there must be bread and content available in the kitchen, and the sandwich must not already exist. The effect of this action is that the bread and content are no longer available in the kitchen, and a sandwich is now available in the kitchen.\n\n3. put_on_tray: This action is for placing a sandwich on a tray. The preconditions are that the sandwich must be in the kitchen and the tray must be at the kitchen. The effect is that the sandwich is no longer in the kitchen and is now on the tray.\n\n4. serve_sandwich_no_gluten: This action is for serving a gluten-free sandwich to a child who is allergic to gluten. The preconditions are that the child is allergic to gluten, waiting at a place, and there is a gluten-free sandwich on a tray at the same place. The effect is that the sandwich is no longer on the tray and the child is served.\n\n5. serve_sandwich: This action is for serving a sandwich to a child who is not allergic to gluten. The preconditions are that the child is not allergic to gluten, waiting at a place, and there is a sandwich on a tray at the same place. The effect is that the sandwich is no longer on the tray and the child is served.\n\n6. move_tray: This action allows a tray to be moved from one place to another. The precondition is that the tray is at the starting place. The effect is that the tray is no longer at the starting place and is now at the destination place.\n\n</domain_nl>\n\n- The natural language description of the problem:\n<problem_nl>\nYou are tasked with preparing and serving sandwiches to fourteen children, some of whom have gluten allergies, using a set of actions that involve making sandwiches, placing them on trays, moving trays, and serving the sandwiches.\n\nInitially:\n- There are three trays, tray1, tray2, and tray3, all located in the kitchen.\n- There are fourteen portions of bread, bread1 through bread14, all in the kitchen.\n- There are fourteen portions of content, content1 through content14, all in the kitchen.\n- Bread portions bread9, bread3, bread12, bread11, and bread5 are gluten-free.\n- Content portions content10, content3, content13, content4, and content7 are gluten-free.\n- Child12, child13, child3, child14, and child1 are allergic to gluten.\n- Child2, child11, child4, child5, child6, child7, child8, child9, and child10 are not allergic to gluten.\n- Child1 is waiting at table3.\n- Child2, child5, child6, and child13 are waiting at table2.\n- Child3 is also waiting at table2.\n- Child4, child7, child9, and child10 are waiting at table1.\n- Child8 is waiting at table2.\n- Child11 and child12 are waiting at table3.\n- Child14 is waiting at table3.\n- There are nineteen sandwiches, sandw1 through sandw19, which do not exist yet.\n\nYour goal is to ensure that:\n- All fourteen children, child1 through child14, are served with a sandwich that they are not allergic to.\n</problem_nl>\n\n- The PDDL problem template:\n<problem_pddl>\n; child-snack task with 14 children and 0.4 gluten factor \n; constant factor of 1.3\n; random seed: 101\n\n(define (problem prob-snack)\n  (:domain child-snack)\n  (:objects\n    child1 child2 child3 child4 child5 child6 child7 child8 child9 child10 child11 child12 child13 child14 -

The domain includes actions for making sandwiches with and without gluten, placing sandwiches on trays, moving trays between places, and serving the sandwiches to the children.\n\nThe actions defined in this domain include:\n\n1. make_sandwich_no_gluten: This action is for making a gluten-free sandwich. The preconditions for this action are that there must be gluten-free bread and gluten-free content available in the kitchen, and the sandwich must not already exist. The effect of this action is that the gluten-free bread and content are no longer available in the kitchen, and a gluten-free sandwich is now available in the kitchen.\n\n2. make_sandwich: This action is for making a regular sandwich that may contain gluten. The preconditions are that there must be bread and content available in the kitchen, and the sandwich must not already exist. The effect of this action is that the bread and content are no longer available in the kitchen, and a sandwich is now available in the kitchen.\n\n3. put_on_tray: This action is for placing a sandwich on a tray. The preconditions are that the sandwich must be in the kitchen and the tray must be at the kitchen. The effect is that the sandwich is no longer in the kitchen and is now on the tray.\n\n4. serve_sandwich_no_gluten: This action is for serving a gluten-free sandwich to a child who is allergic to gluten. The preconditions are that the child is allergic to gluten, waiting at a place, and there is a gluten-free sandwich on a tray at the same place. The effect is that the sandwich is no longer on the tray and the child is served.\n\n5. serve_sandwich: This action is for serving a sandwich to a child who is not allergic to gluten. The preconditions are that the child is not allergic to gluten, waiting at a place, and there is a sandwich on a tray at the same place. The effect is that the sandwich is no longer on the tray and the child is served.\n\n6. move_tray: This action allows a tray to be moved from one place to another. The precondition is that the tray is at the starting place. The effect is that the tray is no longer at the starting place and is now at the destination place.\n\n</domain_nl>\n\n- The natural language description of the problem:\n<problem_nl>\nYou are tasked with preparing and serving sandwiches to fifteen children, some of whom have gluten allergies, using a set of actions that involve making sandwiches, placing them on trays, moving trays, and serving the sandwiches.\n\nInitially:\n- There are three trays, tray1, tray2, and tray3, all located in the kitchen.\n- There are fifteen portions of bread, bread1 through bread15, all in the kitchen.\n- There are fifteen portions of content, content1 through content15, all in the kitchen.\n- Bread portions bread3, bread14, bread6, bread13, bread2, and bread9 are gluten-free.\n- Content portions content8, content2, content13, content5, content1, and content4 are gluten-free.\n- Child1, child10, child5, child7, child8, and child9 are allergic to gluten.\n- Child12, child13, child2, child3, child4, child14, child6, child15, and child11 are not allergic to gluten.\n- Child1 is waiting at table3.\n- Child2 is waiting at table2.\n- Child3, child5, child6, child8, child9, child10, and child13 are waiting at table1.\n- Child4, child7, and child12 are waiting at table3.\n- Child11, child14, and child15 are waiting at table2.\n- There are twenty sandwiches, sandw1 through sandw20, which do not exist yet.\n\nYour goal is to ensure that:\n- All fifteen children, child1 through child15, are served with a sandwich that they are not allergic to.\n</problem_nl>\n\n- The PDDL problem template:\n<problem_pddl>\n; child-snack task with 15 children and 0.4 gluten factor \n; constant factor of 1.3\n; random seed: 234324\n\n(define (problem prob-snack)\n  (:domain child-snack)\n  (:objects\n    child1 child2 child3 child4 child5 child6 child7 child8 child9 child10 child11 child12 child13 child14 child15 -

making a sandwich removes notexist and places the sandwich in the kitchen via (in_kitchen ?s).\n- Gluten-free sandwiches are explicitly tagged with (gluten_free ?s) by make_sandwich_no_gluten; serve_sandwich_no_gluten requires that tag and that the child is allergic_gluten.\n- Regular serve_sandwich requires the child to be not_allergic_gluten.\n- Trays have locations via (at ?tray ?place); move_tray changes that predicate.\n- put_on_tray requires the sandwich to be in the kitchen and the tray at the kitchen; it removes the in_kitchen predicate and adds (on ?s ?t).\n- Effects use deletions with (not (...)) and additions with positive atoms—this is standard PDDL effects.\n\nThis pair of domain + problem should be solvable by FastDownward. If you want, I can also:\n- produce a sample plan (sequence of actions) for this instance, or\n- modify the domain so make_sandwich automatically disallows using gluten-free ingredients unless the no-gluten action is used, or\n- add capacity constraints on trays (if trays can carry only one sandwich) or allow multiple sandwiches per tray (current model allows multiple sandwiches on a tray).",

The domain includes actions for making sandwiches with and without gluten, placing sandwiches on trays, moving trays between places, and serving the sandwiches to the children.\n\nThe actions defined in this domain include:\n\n1. make_sandwich_no_gluten: This action is for making a gluten-free sandwich. The preconditions for this action are that there must be gluten-free bread and gluten-free content available in the kitchen, and the sandwich must not already exist. The effect of this action is that the gluten-free bread and content are no longer available in the kitchen, and a gluten-free sandwich is now available in the kitchen.\n\n2. make_sandwich: This action is for making a regular sandwich that may contain gluten. The preconditions are that there must be bread and content available in the kitchen, and the sandwich must not already exist. The effect of this action is that the bread and content are no longer available in the kitchen, and a sandwich is now available in the kitchen.\n\n3. put_on_tray: This action is for placing a sandwich on a tray. The preconditions are that the sandwich must be in the kitchen and the tray must be at the kitchen. The effect is that the sandwich is no longer in the kitchen and is now on the tray.\n\n4. serve_sandwich_no_gluten: This action is for serving a gluten-free sandwich to a child who is allergic to gluten. The preconditions are that the child is allergic to gluten, waiting at a place, and there is a gluten-free sandwich on a tray at the same place. The effect is that the sandwich is no longer on the tray and the child is served.\n\n5. serve_sandwich: This action is for serving a sandwich to a child who is not allergic to gluten. The preconditions are that the child is not allergic to gluten, waiting at a place, and there is a sandwich on a tray at the same place. The effect is that the sandwich is no longer on the tray and the child is served.\n\n6. move_tray: This action allows a tray to be moved from one place to another. The precondition is that the tray is at the starting place. The effect is that the tray is no longer at the starting place and is now at the destination place.\n\n</domain_nl>\n\n- The natural language description of the problem:\n<problem_nl>\nYou are tasked with preparing and serving sandwiches to fifteen children, some of whom have gluten allergies, using a set of actions that involve making sandwiches, placing them on trays, moving trays, and serving the sandwiches.\n\nInitially:\n- There are three trays, tray1, tray2, and tray3, all located in the kitchen.\n- There are fifteen portions of bread, bread1 through bread15, all in the kitchen.\n- There are fifteen portions of content, content1 through content15, all in the kitchen.\n- Bread portions bread9, bread3, bread13, bread12, and bread6, bread7 are gluten-free.\n- Content portions content4, content15, content14, content9, content3, and content10 are gluten-free.\n- Child2, child11, child5, child15, child10, and child3 are allergic to gluten.\n- Child12, child1, child4, child14, child6, child7, child8, child9, and child13 are not allergic to gluten.\n- Child1, child4, child6, and child7 are waiting at table1.\n- Child2, child3, child5, child10, child12, child13, child14, and child15 are waiting at table2.\n- Child8, child9, and child11 are waiting at table3.\n- There are twenty sandwiches, sandw1 through sandw20, which do not exist yet.\n\nYour goal is to ensure that:\n- All fifteen children, child1 through child15, are served with a sandwich that they are not allergic to.\n</problem_nl>\n\n- The PDDL problem template:\n<problem_pddl>\n; child-snack task with 15 children and 0.4 gluten factor \n; constant factor of 1.3\n; random seed: 101\n\n(define (problem prob-snack)\n  (:domain child-snack)\n  (:objects\n    child1 child2 child3 child4 child5 child6 child7 child8 child9 child10 child11 child12 child13 child14 child15 -

The domain includes actions for making sandwiches with and without gluten, placing sandwiches on trays, moving trays between places, and serving the sandwiches to the children.\n\nThe actions defined in this domain include:\n\n1. make_sandwich_no_gluten: This action is for making a gluten-free sandwich. The preconditions for this action are that there must be gluten-free bread and gluten-free content available in the kitchen, and the sandwich must not already exist. The effect of this action is that the gluten-free bread and content are no longer available in the kitchen, and a gluten-free sandwich is now available in the kitchen.\n\n2. make_sandwich: This action is for making a regular sandwich that may contain gluten. The preconditions are that there must be bread and content available in the kitchen, and the sandwich must not already exist. The effect of this action is that the bread and content are no longer available in the kitchen, and a sandwich is now available in the kitchen.\n\n3. put_on_tray: This action is for placing a sandwich on a tray. The preconditions are that the sandwich must be in the kitchen and the tray must be at the kitchen. The effect is that the sandwich is no longer in the kitchen and is now on the tray.\n\n4. serve_sandwich_no_gluten: This action is for serving a gluten-free sandwich to a child who is allergic to gluten. The preconditions are that the child is allergic to gluten, waiting at a place, and there is a gluten-free sandwich on a tray at the same place. The effect is that the sandwich is no longer on the tray and the child is served.\n\n5. serve_sandwich: This action is for serving a sandwich to a child who is not allergic to gluten. The preconditions are that the child is not allergic to gluten, waiting at a place, and there is a sandwich on a tray at the same place. The effect is that the sandwich is no longer on the tray and the child is served.\n\n6. move_tray: This action allows a tray to be moved from one place to another. The precondition is that the tray is at the starting place. The effect is that the tray is no longer at the starting place and is now at the destination place.\n\n</domain_nl>\n\n- The natural language description of the problem:\n<problem_nl>\nYou are tasked with preparing and serving sandwiches to seven children, some of whom have gluten allergies, using a set of actions that involve making sandwiches, placing them on trays, moving trays, and serving the sandwiches.\n\nInitially:\n- There are two trays, tray1 and tray2, both located in the kitchen.\n- There are seven portions of bread, bread1 through bread7, all in the kitchen.\n- There are seven portions of content, content1 through content7, all in the kitchen.\n- Bread portions bread2 and bread5 are gluten-free.\n- Content portions content6 and content7 are gluten-free.\n- Child4 and child7 are allergic to gluten.\n- Child1, child2, child3, child5, and child6 are not allergic to gluten.\n- Child1, child2, child3, child5, and child7 are waiting at table1.\n- Child4 and child6 are waiting at table3.\n- There are ten sandwiches, sandw1 through sandw10, which do not exist yet.\n\nYour goal is to ensure that:\n- All seven children, child1 through child7, are served with a sandwich that they are not allergic to.\n</problem_nl>\n\n- The PDDL problem template:\n<problem_pddl>\n; child-snack task with 7 children and 0.4 gluten factor \n; constant factor of 1.3\n; random seed: 101\n\n(define (problem prob-snack)\n  (:domain child-snack)\n  (:objects\n    child1 child2 child3 child4 child5 child6 child7 - child\n    bread1 bread2 bread3 bread4 bread5 bread6 bread7 - bread-portion\n    content1 content2 content3 content4 content5 content6 content7 - content-portion\n    tray1 tray2 - tray\n    table1 table2 table3 - place\n    sandw1 sandw2 sandw3 sandw4 sandw5 sandw6 sandw7 sandw8 sandw9 sandw10 - sandwich\n  )\n  (:init\n     (at tray1 kitchen)\n     (at tray2 kitchen)\n     (at_kitchen_bread bread1)\n     (at_kitchen_bread bread2)\n     (at_kitchen_bread bread3)\n     (at_kitchen_bread bread4)\n     (at_kitchen_bread bread5)\n     (at_kitchen_bread bread6)\n     (at_kitchen_bread bread7)\n     (at_kitchen_content content1)\n     (at_kitchen_content content2)\n     (at_kitchen_content content3)\n     (at_kitchen_content content4)\n     (at_kitchen_content content5)\n     (at_kitchen_content content6)\n     (at_kitchen_content content7)\n     (no_gluten_bread bread5)\n     (no_gluten_bread bread2)\n     (no_gluten_content content7)\n     (no_gluten_content content6)\n     (allergic_gluten child4)\n     (allergic_gluten child7)\n     (not_allergic_gluten child1)\n     (not_allergic_gluten child2)\n     (not_allergic_gluten child3)\n     (not_allergic_gluten child5)\n     (not_allergic_gluten child6)\n     (waiting child1 table1)\n     (waiting child2 table1)\n     (waiting child3 table1)\n     (waiting child4 table3)\n     (waiting child5 table1)\n     (waiting child6 table3)\n     (waiting child7 table1)\n     (notexist sandw1)\n     (notexist sandw2)\n     (notexist sandw3)\n     (notexist sandw4)\n     (notexist sandw5)\n     (notexist sandw6)\n     (notexist sandw7)\n     (notexist sandw8)\n     (notexist sandw9)\n     (notexist sandw10)\n  )\n  (:goal\n    (and\n     (served child1)\n     (served child2)\n     (served child3)\n     (served child4)\n     (served child5)\n     (served child6)\n     (served child7)\n    )\n  )\n)\n\n</problem_pddl>\n\n- The PDDL domain template:\n<domain_template>\n(define (domain child-snack)\n  (:requirements :typing :equality)\n  (:types child bread-portion content-portion sandwich tray place)\n  (:constants kitchen - place)\n\n  (:predicates)\n\n  (:action make_sandwich_no_gluten\n    :parameters (?s - sandwich ?b - bread-portion ?c - content-portion)\n    :precondition ()\n    :effect ()\n  )\n\n  (:action make_sandwich\n    :parameters (?s - sandwich ?b - bread-portion ?c - content-portion)\n    :precondition ()\n    :effect ()\n  )\n\n  (:action put_on_tray\n    :parameters (?s - sandwich ?t - tray)\n    :precondition ()\n    :effect ()\n  )\n\n  (:action serve_sandwich_no_gluten\n    :parameters (?s - sandwich ?c - child ?t - tray ?p - place)\n    :precondition ()\n    :effect ()\n  )\n\n  (:action serve_sandwich\n    :parameters (?s - sandwich ?c - child ?t - tray ?p - place)\n    :precondition ()\n    :effect ()\n  )\n\n  (:action move_tray\n    :parameters (?t - tray ?p1 ?p2 - place)\n    :precondition ()\n    :effect ()\n  )\n)\n</domain_template>\n\nYour task is to generate a a PDDL domain and a PDDL problem that accurately represents the scenario described above, so that it is possible to solve the task with the FastDownwards solver.",

make_sandwich produces a gluten sandwich.\n- Serving actions are constrained so: serve_sandwich_no_gluten can serve allergic children (requires no_gluten_sandwich and allergic_gluten), while serve_sandwich can serve children known to be not allergic (requires gluten and not_allergic_gluten).\n- Sandwich creation consumes the specified bread and content in the kitchen (those kitchen predicates are removed).\n- Trays are moved using move_tray; sandwiches placed on trays remain associated with the tray and are served when the tray is at the child's place.\n- The domain uses only positive preconditions and standard delete/add effects (STRIPS-style), so it is compatible with Fast Downward.\n\nIf you want any variations (e.g., allow gluten-free sandwiches to be served to non-allergic children, track consumed sandwiches explicitly, or restrict trays to hold one sandwich), tell me and I will adapt the domain/problem accordingly.",

The domain includes actions for making sandwiches with and without gluten, placing sandwiches on trays, moving trays between places, and serving the sandwiches to the children.\n\nThe actions defined in this domain include:\n\n1. make_sandwich_no_gluten: This action is for making a gluten-free sandwich. The preconditions for this action are that there must be gluten-free bread and gluten-free content available in the kitchen, and the sandwich must not already exist. The effect of this action is that the gluten-free bread and content are no longer available in the kitchen, and a gluten-free sandwich is now available in the kitchen.\n\n2. make_sandwich: This action is for making a regular sandwich that may contain gluten. The preconditions are that there must be bread and content available in the kitchen, and the sandwich must not already exist. The effect of this action is that the bread and content are no longer available in the kitchen, and a sandwich is now available in the kitchen.\n\n3. put_on_tray: This action is for placing a sandwich on a tray. The preconditions are that the sandwich must be in the kitchen and the tray must be at the kitchen. The effect is that the sandwich is no longer in the kitchen and is now on the tray.\n\n4. serve_sandwich_no_gluten: This action is for serving a gluten-free sandwich to a child who is allergic to gluten. The preconditions are that the child is allergic to gluten, waiting at a place, and there is a gluten-free sandwich on a tray at the same place. The effect is that the sandwich is no longer on the tray and the child is served.\n\n5. serve_sandwich: This action is for serving a sandwich to a child who is not allergic to gluten. The preconditions are that the child is not allergic to gluten, waiting at a place, and there is a sandwich on a tray at the same place. The effect is that the sandwich is no longer on the tray and the child is served.\n\n6. move_tray: This action allows a tray to be moved from one place to another. The precondition is that the tray is at the starting place. The effect is that the tray is no longer at the starting place and is now at the destination place.\n\n</domain_nl>\n\n- The natural language description of the problem:\n<problem_nl>\nYou are tasked with preparing and serving sandwiches to eight children, some of whom have gluten allergies, using a set of actions that involve making sandwiches, placing them on trays, moving trays, and serving the sandwiches.\n\nInitially:\n- There are two trays, tray1 and tray2, both located in the kitchen.\n- There are eight portions of bread, bread1 through bread8, all in the kitchen.\n- There are eight portions of content, content1 through content8, all in the kitchen.\n- Bread portions bread2, bread3, and bread7 are gluten-free.\n- Content portions content1, content4, and content5 are gluten-free.\n- Child1, child4, and child6 are allergic to gluten.\n- Child2, child3, child5, child7, and child8 are not allergic to gluten.\n- Child1 and child4 are waiting at table2.\n- Child2, child3, child5, and child6 are waiting at table1.\n- Child7 is waiting at table2.\n- Child8 is waiting at table3.\n- There are eleven sandwiches, sandw1 through sandw11, which do not exist yet.\n\nYour goal is to ensure that:\n- All eight children, child1 through child8, are served with a sandwich that they are not allergic to.\n</problem_nl>\n\n- The PDDL problem template:\n<problem_pddl>\n;

The \"at\" predicate is used for trays.\n- make_sandwich_no_gluten requires both a gluten-free bread and a gluten-free content and produces a sandwich marked as gluten-free.\n- make_sandwich produces a sandwich without the no_gluten_sandwich flag (so serving to allergic children requires using make_sandwich_no_gluten when appropriate).\n- serve_sandwich_no_gluten requires the sandwich be marked no_gluten_sandwich and the child be allergic_gluten; serve_sandwich requires the sandwich not be gluten-free and the child not be allergic.\n- move_tray moves the tray from one place to another.\n- The domain uses :negative-preconditions to express conditions like (not (no_gluten_sandwich ?s)).\n\nYou can save the domain and problem to separate files and run them with Fast Downward. If you want, I can also generate a small example plan or a heuristic configuration for Fast Downward.",

The effect is that the sandwich is no longer in the kitchen and is now on the tray.\n\n4. serve_sandwich_no_gluten: This action is for serving a gluten-free sandwich to a child who is allergic to gluten. The preconditions are that the child is allergic to gluten, waiting at a place, and there is a gluten-free sandwich on a tray at the same place. The effect is that the sandwich is no longer on the tray and the child is served.\n\n5. serve_sandwich: This action is for serving a sandwich to a child who is not allergic to gluten. The preconditions are that the child is not allergic to gluten, waiting at a place, and there is a sandwich on a tray at the same place. The effect is that the sandwich is no longer on the tray and the child is served.\n\n6. move_tray: This action allows a tray to be moved from one place to another.

The serve_sandwich_no_gluten action requires that property and that the child is allergic. The serve_sandwich action requires the child is not allergic and can serve any sandwich (gluten-free or not).\n- Bread and content resource consumption is modeled by removing the corresponding (at_kitchen_bread ...) and (at_kitchen_content ...) facts when a sandwich is made.\n- Trays are moved via move_tray; put_on_tray requires the tray to be at the kitchen and the sandwich to be in the kitchen.\n- Sandwich existence is managed with (notexist ?s) and (in_kitchen_sandwich ?s). After making, (notexist ?s) is deleted and (in_kitchen_sandwich ?s) is added.\n- This encoding uses only standard PDDL constructs compatible with Fast Downward (typing and delete/add effects).\n\nIf you want, I can:\n- produce a small sample plan (sequence of actions) as an example,\n- adjust the model so non-allergic children may only be served regular (non-gluten-free) sandwiches,\n- or tweak resource usage (e.g., allow combining specific bread-content pairs only once).",

both serve actions require the tray to be at the child's waiting place and the sandwich to be on that tray.\n- After serving, the sandwich is removed from being on the tray and the child is marked served; the domain re-asserts notexist for the sandwich (so served sandwiches won't be reused).\n- These files are intendend for FastDownward; you can run the planner with these two files.",

The preconditions for this action are that there must be gluten-free bread and gluten-free content available in the kitchen, and the sandwich must not already exist. The effect of this action is that the gluten-free bread and content are no longer available in the kitchen, and a gluten-free sandwich is now available in the kitchen.\n\n2. make_sandwich: This action is for making a regular sandwich that may contain gluten.

The effect of this action is that the bread and content are no longer available in the kitchen, and a sandwich is now available in the kitchen.\n\n3. put_on_tray: This action is for placing a sandwich on a tray. The preconditions are that the sandwich must be in the kitchen and the tray must be at the kitchen. The effect is that the sandwich is no longer in the kitchen and is now on the tray.\n\n4. serve_sandwich_no_gluten: This action is for serving a gluten-free sandwich to a child who is allergic to gluten. The preconditions are that the child is allergic to gluten, waiting at a place, and there is a gluten-free sandwich on a tray at the same place. The effect is that the sandwich is no longer on the tray and the child is served.\n\n5. serve_sandwich: This action is for serving a sandwich to a child who is not allergic to gluten. The preconditions are that the child is not allergic to gluten, waiting at a place, and there is a sandwich on a tray at the same place. The effect is that the sandwich is no longer on the tray and the child is served.\n\n6. move_tray: This action allows a tray to be moved from one place to another.

The effect is that the sandwich is no longer in the kitchen and is now on the tray.\n\n4. serve_sandwich_no_gluten: This action is for serving a gluten-free sandwich to a child who is allergic to gluten. The preconditions are that the child is allergic to gluten, waiting at a place, and there is a gluten-free sandwich on a tray at the same place. The effect is that the sandwich is no longer on the tray and the child is served.\n\n5. serve_sandwich: This action is for serving a sandwich to a child who is not allergic to gluten. The preconditions are that the child is not allergic to gluten, waiting at a place, and there is a sandwich on a tray at the same place. The effect is that the sandwich is no longer on the tray and the child is served.\n\n6. move_tray: This action allows a tray to be moved from one place to another.

such sandwiches get predicate (no_gluten_sandw ?s).\n- \"notexist\" is used as an initial marker for available sandwich names; making a sandwich removes notexist and adds at_kitchen_sandw.\n- put_on_tray requires the tray to be in the kitchen (per description) and the sandwich to be at the kitchen. The sandwich is placed on the tray with (on_tray ?s ?t).\n- serve_sandwich_no_gluten requires the child to be allergic and the sandwich to be gluten-free; serve_sandwich requires child not allergic. Both require the tray to be at the child's place and the sandwich on that tray.\n- Tray movement is modeled by the at predicate for trays.\n\nYou can feed these files directly to FastDownward (or other PDDL planners supporting :typing and negative effects). If you want, I can also produce a small valid plan example (sequence of actions) or tune/alter the domain to add action costs or parallelization considerations.",
