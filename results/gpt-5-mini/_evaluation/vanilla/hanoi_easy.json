From smallest to largest they are disk A, disk B, disk C, and disk D.\nAs initial conditions I have that, the middle peg holds, from top to bottom, disk A, disk B, disk C, and disk D, while the left peg and the right peg are empty.\nMy goal is to have that the right peg holds, from top to bottom, disk A, disk B, disk C, and disk D, and both the middle peg and the left peg are empty again.\nThe left peg can be used as an intermediate parking spot but must end up empty.\n\nMy plan is as follows:\n\n[PLAN]",
