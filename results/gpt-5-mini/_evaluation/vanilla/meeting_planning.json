Financial → Richmond = 21 min.\n- Betty’s 60‑minute meeting must start no earlier than 5:15 PM and finish no later than 9:45 PM, so the meeting start time must be between 5:15 PM and 8:45 PM.\n\nOption A — Maximize meeting other friends in Richmond (recommended if most friends are in Richmond)\n- Stay in Richmond all day to meet Richmond friends.\n- Depart Richmond at 8:23 PM (22 min travel) → arrive Financial 8:45 PM.\n- Meet Betty 8:45–9:45 PM (60 min).\n- Optional return to Richmond: depart 9:45 PM → arrive Richmond 10:06 PM (21 min).\nWhy choose this: you preserve the maximum daytime availability in Richmond for meeting as many friends as possible and still satisfy the 60‑minute minimum with Betty.\n\nOption B — Meet Betty early and maximize time afterwards in Financial\n- Depart Richmond at 4:53 PM → arrive Financial 5:15 PM.\n- Meet Betty 5:15–6:15 PM (60 min) or extend as long as you like up to 9:45 PM.\n- If you only need 60 min with Betty and also want to meet Financial friends after, you can stay longer; if you want to return to Richmond after 60 min: depart Financial 6:15 PM → arrive Richmond 6:36 PM.\nWhy choose this: good if you want to meet Financial‑District friends after meeting Betty, or if some important friends are only available earlier in Financial.\n\nOption C — Balanced split (meet some Richmond friends during the day, arrive earlier in Financial to meet more Financial friends plus Betty)\n- Example: depart Richmond at 6:38 PM → arrive Financial 7:00 PM.\n- Meet Betty 7:00–8:00 PM (60 min) and use 8:00–9:45 PM for additional Financial friends or to extend the Betty meeting.\nWhy choose this: useful if you have meaningful commitments in both districts and want a compromise.\n\nPractical recommendations\n- If your priority is literally “meet as many friends as possible” and most friends are in Richmond during the day, choose Option A (leave at 8:23 PM). That maximizes time available to meet Richmond friends while guaranteeing the 60‑minute meeting with Betty.\n- If several friends are in the Financial District in the evening (before 8:45 PM) and you want to see them too, pick Option C or B and shift your Richmond departure earlier accordingly.\n- Add a small buffer (5–10 minutes) to departure times for unexpected delays or to be comfortably on time.\n\nIf you tell me where/when your other friends will be (which neighborhoods and their availability windows), I can generate an optimal minute-by-minute schedule that maximizes the number of friends you can meet.",

This is the best single‑trip plan to maximize number of distinct people seen.\n\nOption B — Maximize time with Jessica\n- 9:00–15:00 — Haight (or mix in errands).\n- 15:00 — depart Haight.\n- 15:15–20:15 — meet Jessica (full 5 hours).\nNotes: If your priority is time with Jessica, stay the whole window. You sacrifice late‑afternoon/evening time with Haight people.\n\nOption C — Split visits to see more people in both neighborhoods (more travel)\n- 9:00–14:45 — Haight friends.\n- 14:45 — depart Haight.\n- 15:00–15:45 — meet Jessica (45 min).\n- 15:45 — return to Haight (arrive 16:00) — see more people/commitments.\n- 18:30 — depart Haight.\n- 18:45–19:30 — meet Jessica again (45 min).\nTotal Jessica time = 90 minutes (split). Travel: 4 trips (two round‑trips). Use this only if you must see particular Haight friends in the late afternoon and still want to hit the 90‑minute minimum with Jessica.\n\nOption D — Late evening minimum (if you want to keep day free)\n- 9:00–17:30 — Haight.\n- 17:30 — depart Haight.\n- 17:45–19:15 — meet Jessica (90 minutes).\nNotes: Later meeting lets you maximize Haight time and still get a single 90‑minute block with Jessica well within her availability.\n\nRecommendation (best for “meet as many friends as possible”)\n- Choose Option A: stay in Haight until 15:00, depart at 15:00, arrive Sunset 15:15, meet Jessica 15:15–16:45 (90 minutes), then return to Haight at 16:45 if you have more Haight friends available (arrive 17:00).

Travel: 17 + (optional) 18 = 35 minutes (or 17 one‑way if you finish at Presidio).\n\nOption C — Split visits: see many friends and give Matthew a longer total time by visiting twice\n- Depart Nob Hill at 10:43 → arrive Presidio 11:00.\n- Meet Matthew 11:00–12:00 (1 hour).\n- Depart Presidio at 12:00 → arrive Nob Hill at 12:18; spend 12:18–2:28 with Nob Hill friends.\n- Depart Nob Hill 2:28 → arrive Presidio 2:45.\n- Meet Matthew 2:45–3:15 (30 minutes).\n- Outcome: You meet Matthew for 1.5 hours total while still spending a long block in Nob Hill.

Travel: three legs (17 + 18 + 17 = 52 minutes) plus any final return.\n\nOption D — Minimal travel, minimal disruption (if you don’t want to move much)\n- Remain in Nob Hill and only travel once as in Option B (2:28 depart) to get Matthew’s 30 minutes.

Leaving at 7:37 PM is the latest possible departure that still gets you to Chinatown by 8:00 PM, which is the latest start that allows a continuous 105-minute meeting before David leaves at 9:45 PM. This schedule therefore maximizes time at Golden Gate Park while satisfying the David constraint.\n\nQuick calculations and alternatives:\n- Travel GGP → Chinatown = 23 minutes. To begin meeting David by 8:00 PM (latest possible start to finish by 9:45 PM): depart GGP at 7:37 PM.\n- Time spent at GGP in this plan: 9:00 AM–7:37 PM = 10 hours 37 minutes.\n- Alternative if you prefer to maximize time with David: depart GGP at 3:37 PM, arrive Chinatown at 4:00 PM, meet David 4:00–9:45 PM (345 minutes). That reduces time at GGP but gives the longest possible meeting with David.\n- Splitting meetings (meeting David earlier and again later) is possible but doesn’t increase the number of distinct friends met and adds travel overhead (23 min each way).\n\nIf you want, I can produce a minute-by-minute timeline for the day or adjust the plan if you have specific other friends/locations and their availability.",

This meets the constraint (Margaret is available 19:00–19:45 and you have >=15 minutes).

Pros: less switching; cons: fewer distinct meetings in Pacific Heights.\n- Max Margaret time: stay in Pacific Heights from ~18:30 and meet Margaret 19:00–19:45 (45 min). Pros: longest time with Margaret; cons: reduces Marina late-afternoon time.\n- More Pacific time: move the midday switch earlier (e.g., go to Pacific at 11:00) if you have more friends there—same mechanics, different time split.\n\nPractical notes\n- Leave a 5–10 minute personal buffer before/from each travel segment for small delays or to finish conversations gracefully.\n- Confirm Margaret’s exact meeting spot and whether she prefers a start time (earlier in her 7:00–7:45 window or later).\n- If you want, tell me how many friends or specific meeting times/locations you have in each neighborhood and I’ll produce an optimized minute-by-minute plan.",

A single continuous meeting minimizes travel overhead so you maximize available time to meet other friends.\n\nWhy: Jeffrey is available 7:00–17:30 and you arrive Castro at 9:00. A single 105‑minute block at GGP uses the least extra time for travel (one round trip) so you free the most time back in Castro to meet other people.\n\nConcrete schedules considered\n\n1) Early single continuous meeting (recommended)\n- Depart The Castro at 9:00 → travel 11 min → arrive Golden Gate Park 9:11.\n- Meet Jeffrey 9:11–10:56 (105 minutes).\n- Depart GGP 10:56 → travel 13 min → arrive The Castro 11:09.\nResult: requirement met, you are back in Castro by 11:09 with the whole afternoon to meet other friends or sightsee.\n\n2) Longer single continuous meeting (also good if you want more time with Jeffrey)\n- Same departure 9:00 → arrive 9:11.\n- Meet Jeffrey, e.g., 9:11–12:11 (3 hours).\n- Return depart 12:11 → arrive Castro 12:24.\nUse if you want to prioritize Jeffrey more than meeting many others.\n\n3) Late single continuous meeting (if you want to meet other Castro friends in the morning)\n- Stay in Castro morning for meetings.\n- Leave Castro by 13:00 → arrive GGP 13:11.\n- Meet Jeffrey 13:11–14:56 (105 minutes).\n- Return depart 14:56 → arrive Castro 15:09.\nThis preserves morning availability in Castro but reduces afternoon time there.\n\n4) Split meeting (two blocks totalling ≥105 min) — not recommended if you want to maximize number of different friend meetings\n- Example: meet Jeffrey 9:11–9:56 (45 min), return to Castro 10:09, meet other people, go back to GGP later for a second 60‑minute block.\n- Downside: extra travel (each extra round trip costs 24 minutes total) reduces time available to see other people.\n\nFeasibility check\n- Jeffrey is present through 17:30, so any single continuous 105‑minute block between 9:11 and 17:30 is feasible.\n- Travel times: Castro→GGP = 11 min, GGP→Castro = 13 min. Account for 24 minutes round‑trip per visit.\n\nFinal pick\n- Schedule 1 (9:00 depart, 9:11–10:56 meeting, back to Castro 11:09) is the best tradeoff for meeting the most different friends overall: it meets the Jeffrey constraint and minimizes travel overhead so you maximize remaining time in Castro to meet additional friends.",

Embarcadero → Marina = 12 minutes.\n- Goal: meet as many friends as possible (implicit assumption: most other friends are in Marina and available during the day).\n\nKey idea\n- To maximize the number of Marina friends you can see, minimize time away from Marina while still meeting Barbara for at least 60 minutes sometime during her 1:30–8:45 window.

After 10:25 you have a single large free block from 10:25–5:45 (7 h 20 min) within Jessica’s availability window.\n\nOption B — Meet Jessica mid-day\n- Leave Presidio at 11:50, arrive Marina 12:00.\n- Meet Jessica 12:00–13:00, depart 13:00, arrive Presidio 13:10.\n- Result: two free blocks (9:00–11:50 = 2 h 50 min, and 13:10–5:45 = 4 h 35 min). Total free time in 9:00–5:45 = 7 h 25 min, but it’s fragmented (less convenient for many short meetings).\n\nOption C — Meet Jessica late (maximizes one big free block earlier)\n- Leave Presidio at 16:35, arrive Marina 16:45.\n- Meet Jessica 16:45–17:45 (60 minutes).\n- Leave Marina 17:45, arrive Presidio 17:55 (if you plan to return).\n- Result: you get a single long free block 9:00–16:35 = 7 h 35 min before meeting Jessica (largest single continuous block within the 9:15–5:45 window).\n\nOption D — Split the 60 minutes into multiple shorter visits\n- Example: two 30-minute visits requires extra travel (each round trip costs 20 minutes). Splitting increases travel overhead and fragments free time — worse for maximizing number of other meetings.\n\nEvaluation / tradeoffs\n- Splitting is inefficient due to repeated 10-minute trips each way.\n- Contiguous 60-minute meeting is best.\n- If your goal is to maximize the total contiguous time available to meet other friends in one continuous block, Option C (meet Jessica late, 4:45–5:45) is best: it leaves you 7 h 35 min in one block (9:00–4:35) for meeting many friends back-to-back with only one 10-minute trip at the end.\n- If you prefer to get Jessica done first thing so the rest of the day is free in the afternoon (for events that are more afternoon-oriented), Option A (9:15–10:15) is nearly as good; it yields a large contiguous afternoon block from 10:25 onward (7 h 20 min) and minimizes the chance of being delayed later in the day.\n\nRecommended plan (best for meeting the most friends)\n- Follow Option C: leave Presidio at 16:35, meet Jessica 16:45–17:45. This produces the longest single contiguous free block (9:00–16:35) in which you can schedule the largest number of sequential meetups with other friends, while still satisfying Jessica’s 60-minute requirement.\n\nIf you’d rather free up the afternoon instead, pick Option A (9:15–10:15).

I assume your “day” of meeting friends ends at 8:00 PM (Deborah’s end time); I’ll note how things change if you treat the day as longer than 8:00 PM.\n\nFeasible meeting-window constraint for Deborah\n- Latest possible start for a 75-minute meeting that finishes by 8:00 PM is 6:45 PM (6:45–8:00).\n- To arrive by 6:45 you must depart The Castro at 6:28 PM (6:28 + 17 min travel = 6:45).\n- Earliest possible arrival at Deborah’s location is 2:15 PM (depart The Castro at 1:58 PM).\n\nThree representative schedules\n\nOption A — Early short visit (meet Deborah as early as possible)\n- Leave The Castro at 1:58 PM → arrive Sunset 2:15 PM.\n- Meet Deborah 2:15–3:30 PM (75 min).\n- Leave Sunset 3:30 PM → arrive Castro 3:47 PM.\n- Remainder of day in Castro from 3:47–8:00 PM.\nPros: Gets Deborah done early so you can use the late afternoon / evening to see many people back in Castro. Cons: splits the day; you travel midday.\nCastro time between 9:00–8:00 (excluding away time) = 9 hrs 11 min.\n\nOption B — Latest possible meeting (stay in Castro as long as possible, meet Deborah at the end)\n- Stay in Castro until 6:28 PM.\n- Leave The Castro 6:28 PM → arrive Sunset 6:45 PM.\n- Meet Deborah 6:45–8:00 PM (75 min).\n- (Return trip arrives Castro at 8:17 PM, which is after 8:00 PM.)\nPros: Maximizes time spent in The Castro during the 9:00–8:00 window (so you can meet the most Castro-based friends during that window). Cons: you finish the Deborah meeting at the end of her availability and will travel home after 8:00.\nCastro time between 9:00–8:00 = 9 hrs 28 min (best if you want maximal time in Castro before 8:00).\n\nOption C — Mid-afternoon meeting\n- Example: Leave Castro 3:43 PM → arrive Sunset 4:00 PM.\n- Meet Deborah 4:00–5:15 PM (75 min).\n- Leave Sunset 5:15 PM → arrive Castro 5:32 PM.\nPros: Balanced: you keep much of the day in Castro and still finish early enough to have evening time in Castro. Castro time 9:00–8:00 = 9 hrs 11 min (same total Castro time as Option A if you count the full day to 8:00 and include travel after 8:00).\n\nWhich is best?\n- If your primary goal is to meet as many friends as possible who are concentrated in The Castro during the day (and you consider the “day” to end at 8:00 PM), Option B is best: depart at 6:28 PM, meet Deborah 6:45–8:00 PM. That leaves you in Castro the longest during 9:00–8:00.\n- If instead you want to be back in Castro earlier in the evening (for example to meet evening-only friends or events after 6:00 PM), choose Option A or C (meet Deborah earlier, minimum 75 minutes, and return to Castro well before 8:00 PM).\n- If your “day” continues past 8:00 PM and you count post-8:00 time as available for meeting friends, all options require the same total out-of-Castro time (17 + 75 + 17 = 109 minutes). In that case any start time for Deborah between 2:15 and 6:45 yields the same total available Castro-minutes across the full visit; then choose the schedule by personal preference (early, mid, or late meeting).\n\nConcrete recommended schedule (if you want to maximize number of friends seen in Castro before 8:00 PM)\n- Stay in Castro until 6:28 PM.\n- Depart 6:28 PM → arrive Sunset 6:45 PM.\n- Meet Deborah 6:45–8:00 PM (75 minutes).\n- Return trip: depart 8:00 PM → arrive Castro 8:17 PM.\n\nIf you’d like, tell me:\n- whether the “day” ends at 8:00 PM or later, and\n- whether your other friends are mostly in The Castro or spread around,\nand I’ll give a final optimized minute-by-minute itinerary for meeting the maximum number of friends.",

For each I give departure/arrival times, how much Nob Hill time remains for meeting other friends, travel overhead, pros and cons.\n\nOption A — Late short meeting (recommended if you want to maximize time available to meet other friends)\n- Plan: stay in Nob Hill all day, leave 6:13 PM, arrive Presidio 6:30 PM, meet Timothy 6:30–7:00 PM (30 min).\n- Travel back (optional): leave Presidio at 7:00 → arrive Nob Hill 7:18 PM.\n- Nob Hill time available for meeting other friends: 9:00 AM – 6:13 PM (9 h 13 m = 553 minutes).\n- Total travel overhead: 17 + 18 = 35 minutes (round trip).\n- Pros: Maximizes contiguous time in Nob Hill to meet the most friends; minimal travel disruption; guarantees the required 30-minute meeting.\n- Cons: Only a 30-minute meeting with Timothy.\n\nOption B — Early short meeting (minimum disruption, splits the day)\n- Plan: depart Nob Hill 12:43 PM → arrive Presidio 1:00 PM, meet Timothy 1:00–1:30 PM, depart 1:30 → arrive Nob Hill 1:48 PM.\n- Nob Hill time available: 9:00–12:43 (3 h 43 m) and 1:48 PM onward.\n- Travel overhead: 35 minutes round trip.\n- Pros: Lets you meet morning friends, still leaves most of afternoon/evening back in Nob Hill for more meetings.\n- Cons: Interrupts the middle of the day; you get only a 30-minute meeting unless you stay longer.\n\nOption C — Single long meeting with Timothy (if you prioritize long time with Timothy)\n- Example: depart 12:43 PM → meet 1:00–4:00 PM (3 hours) → depart 4:00 → arrive Nob Hill 4:18 PM.\n- Nob Hill time available: 9:00–12:43 (3 h 43 m) and 4:18 PM onward.\n- Travel overhead: 35 minutes round trip.\n- Pros: Substantial time with Timothy.\n- Cons: Large chunk of the day away from Nob Hill, reducing how many other friends you can meet.\n\nOption D — Two short visits (balance: meet lots of Nob Hill friends + see Timothy twice)\n- Plan example:\n  1) Depart 12:43 → meet Timothy 1:00–1:30 → back to Nob Hill by 1:48.\n  2) Depart 5:13 → arrive 5:30 → meet Timothy 5:30–6:30 → back by 6:48.\n- Total travel overhead: 2 round trips = 70 minutes.\n- Nob Hill time blocks: 9:00–12:43 (3 h 43 m) and 1:48–5:13 (3 h 25 m) and after 6:48.\n- Pros: You get two meaningful visits with Timothy while still keeping multiple Nob Hill meeting blocks (good if friends’ availability is scattered).\n- Cons: More travel time; breaks your day into multiple segments.\n\nRecommendation (best to meet the most friends)\n- If your primary objective is to maximize total time available to meet many distinct friends concentrated in Nob Hill, Option A (Late short meeting, 6:30–7:00) is the best: it gives you the largest continuous Nob Hill window (9:00–6:13) with minimal travel overhead while still satisfying Timothy’s 30-minute requirement.\n- If your friends’ availability is scattered across the day and you need multiple meeting windows, Option D (two visits) is a strong alternative — it increases the number of separate time blocks in which you can meet different people, at the cost of additional travel.\n\nPractical notes\n- To be safe with possible small delays, leave 5–10 minutes earlier than the exact departure times above (e.g., leave Nob Hill at 6:05–6:10 to arrive well before 6:30).\n- If you decide you want more than 30 minutes with Timothy, use Option C or extend Option D’s evening slot — just add the corresponding travel time.\n\nIf you tell me:\n- roughly how many other friends you want to meet and their likely availability windows (morning/afternoon/evening), I’ll produce a minute-by-minute schedule maximizing number of friend meetings and include buffers for travel.",

This maximizes time available in Haight and guarantees the required 90‑minute meeting with Robert before he leaves at 9:30.\n\nWhy this is optimal for your stated goal\n- You arrive Haight 9:00 AM and can meet any friends there all day.\n- Robert’s window is 4:30–9:30 PM. To still get a 90‑minute contiguous meeting before he leaves, the latest meeting start is 8:00 PM.\n- To arrive at North Beach by 8:00 you must depart Haight by 7:41 PM (travel = 19 minutes).

Meet Robert 4:30–9:30 PM (300 minutes).\n   - Best if your priority is maximizing length with Robert (but you’ll miss late‑afternoon/evening Haight friends).\n\n2) Split day and still visit Haight after meeting Robert:\n   - Leave Haight at 4:11 PM → arrive NB 4:30 PM.

Note: returning to North Beach later would require another 19‑minute trip each way.\n\nPractical suggestions\n- Add a 5–10 minute buffer to departure times for unpredictable delays; e.g., depart Haight at 7:35 PM instead of 7:41 if you want margin.\n- If you don’t actually have many Haight friends to meet, choose the 4:30 arrival to maximize time with Robert.\n\nIf you want, tell me:\n- How many friends/how many different meetups you expect in Haight and roughly when they’re available, and I’ll produce a minute-by-minute schedule that balances meeting count vs Robert time.",

Minimal travel time.\nCons: You spend almost the entire day in FD and miss daytime opportunities with friends at Union Square.\n\nOption B — Balanced / meet friends in both neighborhoods (recommended)\n- 9:00–12:30 PM: Meet friends in Financial District.\n- 12:30 PM: Leave FD for Union Square (arrive 12:39).\n- 12:45–4:45 PM: Meet friends in Union Square (afternoon block).\n- 4:45 PM: Leave US for FD (arrive 4:54).\n- 5:00–8:50 PM: Meet more friends / dinner in Financial District.\n- 9:21 PM: Leave FD for Union Square (arrive 9:30).\n- 9:30–10:00 PM: Meet Joseph (30 minutes).\n\nPros: You meet friends in both neighborhoods, avoid long evening travel (only one evening trip), and you still give Joseph a full 30-minute meeting. Total travel time: three crossings would be 27 minutes in this plan.\nCons: Requires two switches during the day (one midday, one late evening) and some downtime between 8:50 and 9:21 PM if you stay in FD.\n\nOption C — Stay in Union Square afternoon/evening (minimize evening rush, shorter day travel)\n- 9:00–2:30 PM: Meet Financial District friends in the morning.\n- 2:30 PM: Leave FD for Union Square (arrive 2:39).\n- 2:45–10:00 PM: Stay in Union Square (meet US friends, relax, and be ready for Joseph).\n- 9:30–9:45 (or longer) PM: Meet Joseph (minimum 15 minutes — you could meet him 9:30–10:00 for 30 minutes).\n- 10:00 PM: Done.\n\nPros: Only one one-way trip midday, you avoid an evening commute and any risk of being delayed when Joseph's window begins. Good if many friends are in US in late afternoon/evening.\nCons: You give up meeting FD friends later in the day and spend a long continuous stretch in US.\n\nRecommendation\n- If your goal is literally to \"meet as many friends as possible\" across both neighborhoods, Option B (Balanced) is the best compromise: it allows substantial blocks with friends in both FD and US while guaranteeing you arrive at US in time to meet Joseph for at least 15 minutes (in the schedule above you get the full 30 minutes).\n- If you prefer minimal travel and minimal logistical risk for Joseph's window, choose Option C and be already at Union Square by the evening.\n\nConcrete timing you can follow (exact times to guarantee Joseph meeting):\n- Latest you can leave FD and still get 15 minutes with Joseph: leave FD at 9:36 PM → arrive US 9:45 PM → meet 9:45–10:00 PM (15 min).\n- To maximize time with Joseph (full 30 minutes): leave FD at 9:21 PM → arrive US 9:30 PM → meet 9:30–10:00 PM.\n\nIf you want, tell me:\n- how many distinct friends you expect at FD and US (or times they’re available),\n- whether you prefer fewer trips or more meetings,\nand I’ll produce a refined hourly plan tailored to those preferences.",

I show several feasible schedules and pick the best depending on your objective.\n\nOption A — continuous meeting (several choices)\n\n1) Earliest continuous block (good if you want afternoon in Union Square)\n- Leave Union Square at 11:51 → arrive Nob Hill 12:00\n- Meet Mary 12:00–13:15 (75 minutes)\n- Leave Nob Hill 13:15 → arrive Union Square 13:22\n- Remaining day at Union Square after 13:22\n\n2) Latest continuous block (best if you want to spend the most time at Union Square first)\n- Stay at Union Square until 14:51\n- Leave Union Square 14:51 → arrive Nob Hill 15:00\n- Meet Mary 15:00–16:15 (75 minutes)\n- Leave Nob Hill 16:15 → arrive Union Square 16:22\n\n3) Maximum-length meeting with Mary (if your priority is maximum time with Mary)\n- Leave Union Square 11:51 → arrive Nob Hill 12:00\n- Meet Mary 12:00–16:15 (4 hr 15 min)\n- Leave Nob Hill 16:15 → arrive Union Square 16:22\n\n4) Balanced midday block (compromise)\n- Leave Union Square 12:21 → arrive Nob Hill 12:30\n- Meet Mary 12:30–13:45 (75 minutes)\n- Leave Nob Hill 13:45 → arrive Union Square 13:52\n\nOption B — split meetings (total meeting ≥ 75 minutes). Recommended if you want to meet many different friends at Union Square while still fulfilling the Mary minimum.\n\nExample split that yields exactly 75 minutes total while maximizing Union Square time:\n\nSplit plan (45 min + 30 min)\n- Leave Union Square 11:51 → arrive Nob Hill 12:00\n- Meet Mary 12:00–12:45 (45 min)\n- Leave Nob Hill 12:45 → arrive Union Square 12:52 (7 min return)\n- Meet friends at Union Square 12:52–14:36\n- Leave Union Square 14:36 → arrive Nob Hill 14:45 (9 min)\n- Meet Mary 14:45–15:15 (30 min)  — total with Mary = 45 + 30 = 75 min\n- Leave Nob Hill 15:15 → arrive Union Square 15:22\n\nThis split yields:\n- Large contiguous windows at Union Square (9:00–11:51 and 12:52–14:36) to see other people.\n- Only two short travel legs (9 and 7 minutes each way).\n- All Mary time falls within her 12:00–16:15 window.\n\nAlternate split with more flexibility (e.g., 40 + 35 or 50 + 25) can be constructed the same way; just ensure start times satisfy travel and Mary’s window and total ≥ 75.\n\nWhich is best?\n- If your top priority is to meet the maximum number of distinct friends across the day (most likely many are at Union Square), Option B (split visits) is best — it gives you large blocks at Union Square while still satisfying the 75-minute minimum with Mary.\n- If Mary must be met in one continuous block, Option A.2 (latest continuous block 15:00–16:15) is best for maximizing your time in Union Square before the Mary meeting. If your priority is maximum time with Mary, choose Option A.3 (12:00–16:15).\n\nRecommended schedule (practical, maximizes distinct meetings)\n- Use the split plan above (12:00–12:45 and 14:45–15:15). It minimizes disruption, satisfies the 75-minute minimum exactly, and leaves long windows at Union Square to meet as many other friends as possible.\n\nIf you want, tell me:\n- whether Mary’s 75 minutes must be continuous or can be split, and\n- whether most other friends will be at Union Square or Nob Hill\n\nand I’ll produce a final minute-by-minute itinerary for the whole day.",

        "response": "{\n  \"match\": false,\n  \"reason\": \"The golden plan specifies starting at Union Square at 9:00, traveling 9 minutes to Nob Hill arriving at 9:09, waiting until 12:00, then meeting Mary continuously from 12:00 to 1:15 (75 minutes). The candidate plan presents multiple alternative schedules and, in its recommended schedule, uses a split Mary visit (12:00–12:45 and 14:45–15:15) with additional Union Square blocks. This does not reproduce the golden plan’s exact start time and a single continuous Mary meeting, so it does not match the golden plan.\"\n}",
