Step-by-step preconditions are satisfied as noted.\n\nWhy next object_9 object_6 is unreachable\nTo add next object_9 object_6, one of the action types that can add a next fact for a hand object must apply to object_9:\n\n- paltry(9, X, 6) can add next 9 6 only if X is the object that has cats true (cats is only object_0). So paltry to make next 9 6 would require next 0 6 to exist and vase 9 0. But next 0 6 cannot be created in this domain because memory is the only operator that changes next for object_0, and memory requires springs on both the old and new targets. You have spring 5 and spring 7, not spring 6, so memory can only move next 0 from 5 to 7 (not to 6). No other action produces next 0 6. So paltry cannot produce next 9 6.\n\n- tightfisted(9, s, 6) can add next 9 6 if s is a sneeze object and next s 6 is true and vase 9 s exists. The sneeze objects available are object_3 and object_4. next object_3 object_6 is true initially, so s = object_3 is the only candidate (object_4's next targets are 7/8, not 6). So to use tightfisted you would need vase 9 3. But vase facts for a hand are only ever created by clip or sip; sip requires the middle argument to be cats (object_0), so sip cannot create vase 9 3 (it would require cats 3, which is false). So the only way to get vase 9 3 would be clip 9 3 t for some t where both next 3 t and next 9 t are true at the time of the clip. There is no t that satisfies both next 3 t and next 9 t in the initial state, and any t you might try to make common cannot be made without already having next 9 6 (circular) or making next 3 8 (which is impossible: wretched on object_3 can only toggle between targets 6 and 5 because collect(6,1) and collect(5,1) pair on the same stupendous; it cannot make next 3 8 because collect(6,1) and collect(8,2) are on different stupendous values). Thus you cannot create vase 9 3 by clip either.\n\nThere is no action that directly makes object_9 a sneeze object or that otherwise allows wretched/memory to act on 9. So both routes (paltry via next 0 6, or tightfisted via vase 9 3) are blocked.\n\nTherefore next object_9 object_6 is unreachable from the given initial facts and operators.\n\nIf you want to reach the full triple goal, you can modify the problem in one of these ways (examples):\n- Add spring object_6 (so memory 0 5 6 becomes possible), which would allow next 0 6 and then paltry 9 0 6 if you can also get vase 9 0.\n- Or add collect 8 1 (or collect 6 2) so that object_3 can be wretched to target 8 (or object_4 to target 6), enabling creation of a vase linking object_9 to the proper sneeze via clip.\n\nIf you want, I can (a) produce a fully explicit trace of the reachable plan above (with the exact facts after each step), (b) attempt to find a different plan that achieves a maximal subset of goals, or (c) show precisely which single minimal change to the initial facts would make next object_9 object_6 reachable.

      "response": "Summary: No valid plan exists from the given initial state to achieve all three goals. Two of the required goal facts (next object_10 object_7 and next object_11 object_9) are unreachable under the action models you provided.\n\nReasoning (concise, but complete):\n\n1. Which actions can add next facts?\n   - paltry adds next(o0,o2) but requires vase(o0,o1) and next(o1,o2) and also requires cats(o1) (the second parameter must be a cat).\n   - tightfisted adds next(o0,o2) but requires vase(o0,o1), sneeze(o1) (the second parameter must be a sneeze), and next(o1,o2).\n     (Note: tightfisted's second parameter must be a sneeze object and paltry's must be a cat object — see their preconditions.)\n   - memory adds next(o0,o2) but only when o0 is a cat and both o1 and o2 are spring objects (so it only maps cats between spring objects).\n   - wretched adds next(o0,o2) but only when o0 is a sneeze object and the o1/o2 pair must match the collect patterns (so it only produces next for sneeze objects, and its output targets come from the specific collect pairs).\n\n2. Which objects are cats, springs, sneeze?\n   - cats: object_0, object_1 (only these two).\n   - spring: object_6, object_8 (only these two).\n   - sneeze: object_4, object_5.\n\n3. Consequence for next facts involving cats:\n   - The only action that can produce next facts whose subject is a cat is memory, and memory requires the target to be a spring. Thus any next(cat, X) that can ever be true must have X ∈ {object_6, object_8} (the spring objects). In particular, next(object_0, object_7) and next(object_1, object_7) and next(object_0, object_9) and next(object_1, object_9) cannot be produced by any action.\n\n4. Consequence for achieving next(hand,7) and next(hand,9):\n   - paltry (which produces next(hand,·)) requires next(cat, target) as a precondition (it requires cats as the second parameter and next(second,param3)). tightfisted also needs next(o1,o2) where o1 is a sneeze.\n   - For the two specific goals next(object_10,object_7) and next(object_11,object_9) we would need some action to create those next facts:\n     - paltry(10, cat, 7) would need next(cat,7). But next(cat,7) is impossible (see 3).\n     - paltry(11, cat, 9) would need next(cat,9). But next(cat,9) is impossible (see 3).\n     - tightfisted cannot help here because its second parameter must be a sneeze object, and producing the needed next(sneeze,7) or next(sneeze,9) for those schemes either doesn't match available collect pairs or still doesn't allow producing next for the hand objects without a cat-vase that depends on impossible cat-nexts.\n   - Therefore next(object_10,object_7) and next(object_11,object_9) are unreachable.\n\n5. Since at least two goal facts are unreachable, the conjunction of goals is unreachable and no plan can achieve all three goals.\n\nIf you want, I can:\n- produce a proof-of-impossibility that spells out the exact impossibility of each required precondition in more formal detail, or\n- attempt to find a plan to achieve any subset of the goals that is actually reachable (for example, show how to get next(object_5,object_9) or next(object_0,object_8) which are reachable), or\n- suggest minimal changes to the domain or initial state that would make the three goals jointly achievable.

After these three actions you will have next 12 7.)\n\nWhy next 10 7 and next 11 7 are impossible\n- Which operators can produce a new fact next X 7? The only actions that add a next fact are paltry, memory, wretched and tightfisted.\n  - memory(object_0, object_1, object_2) can add next object_0 object_2, but it requires cats object_0. Objects 10 and 11 are not cats in the initial facts (cats only holds for object_0 and object_1). So memory cannot create next 10 7 or next 11 7.\n  - wretched(object_0, ...) can add next object_0 object_2 but it requires sneeze object_0. Only objects 4 and 5 have sneeze initially; 10 and 11 do not, and no operator ever adds sneeze. So wretched cannot produce next 10 7 or next 11 7.\n  - paltry(object_0, object_1, object_2) adds next object_0 object_2 but requires cats object_1 and next object_1 object_2. That means paltry could only add next for object_0 using a cats object_1 ∈ {0,1}. To get next * 7 via paltry you'd need next 0 7 or next 1 7 first. But neither next 0 7 nor next 1 7 can be created: memory could change next 0/1 but only among spring values (6,8) — there is no spring 7 — and wretched needs sneeze 0 or 1, which we don't have. So paltry cannot produce next 10 7 or next 11 7.\n  - tightfisted(object_0, object_1, object_2) can add next object_0 object_2 only if object_1 has sneeze and next object_1 object_2. The only sneezers are 4 and 5, so tightfisted could add next 10 7 only if there exists a sneeze object b∈{4,5} with next b 7 and a vase 10 b. We can make next 4 7 (via wretched 4,6,7,2), but to use tightfisted we also need vase 10 4. Creating vase 10 4 requires clip or sip:\n    - sip requires the second argument be a cats object (0 or 1), so sip cannot create vase 10 4.\n    - clip(10,4,c) requires next 10 c and next 4 c for some c. The only initial next for 4 is 6, so to use clip with 4 we need next 10 6. But next 10 6 cannot be created: memory can't (cats 10 false), wretched can't (no sneeze 10), paltry needs a cats b with next b 6 (only b=1 has next1 6) but paltry would require vase 10 1 (which in turn is blocked), so you get a circular dependency. There is no operator sequence that can produce the needed vase 10 4 (or vase 11 4) without already having the target next facts.\n- Because every route to create next 10 7 or next 11 7 runs into one of these unsatisfiable precondition blocks (no way to make 10 or 11 into a sneezing or cats object, and paltry/wretched alternatives require unreachable intermediate next facts), next 10 7 and next 11 7 are unreachable.\n\nConclusion\n- A partial plan can set next 12 7 (shown above).\n- No plan exists (in the given domain and from the given initial facts) that achieves next 10 7 or next 11 7, so the full goal {next 10 7, next 11 7, next 12 7} is unattainable.\n\nIf you want, I can:\n- Output the exact ordered action sequence that yields next 12 7 (three actions, as above).\n- Try to search for any nonobvious workaround (I already checked the operator patterns); or\n- If you can add or change initial facts (for example make 10 or 11 a cat or give them sneeze, or add a collect that aligns with 7), I can produce a full feasible plan.",

      "response": "Short answer: there is no valid plan — the goal is unreachable from the given initial state and operators. \n\nReasoning (key points, kept concise):\n\n1) Which actions can create next facts?\n- paltry(o0,o1,o2) adds next(o0,o2) but requires cats(o1). cats is true only for object_0, so paltry can only add next(o0,o2) when next(object_0,o2) already exists. In the second initial state next(object_0,·) is only next(object_0,object_5). Memory can only change next(object_0,·) among nodes that are spring nodes; here the spring nodes are object_5 and object_7, so paltry can only ever produce next(...,object_5) or next(...,object_7). Therefore paltry cannot produce next(...,object_6) or next(...,object_8).\n\n- tightfisted(o0,o1,o2) adds next(o0,o2) but requires (a) sneeze(o1) and (b) next(o1,o2) and (c) vase(o0,o1). In the initial state sneeze nodes are only object_3 and object_4, and initially next(object_3,object_6) and next(object_4,object_8) are the only next facts with sneeze sources. So tightfisted can only add next(...,object_6) (by using object_3 as o1) or next(...,object_8) (by using object_4 as o1) — but each application also requires a vase relation vase(o0,o1) already in place.\n\n- wretched can add next(o0,o2) only when o0 is a sneeze node (so again only possible for o0 = object_3 or object_4). It therefore cannot directly create next for o0 = object_9,10,11,12 since those objects are not sneeze nodes.\n\n- memory only affects next(object_0,·) (and only between spring nodes object_5 and object_7 here).\n\n2) Creating the needed vase(o0,o1) is the sticking point\n- The only actions that add vase facts are clip and sip.\n- sip(o0,o1,o2) requires cats(o1) — so sip can only add vase(o0,object_0). That is useful only if you already have next(o0,o2) and next(object_0,o2).\n- clip(o0,o1,o2) requires next(o1,o2) and next(o0,o2). Thus clip can create vase(o0,o1) only if next(o0,o2) is already present (the very same o2). In other words, clip cannot bootstrap a vase for a pair (o0,o1) unless the desired next(o0,o2) already exists. Clip is therefore circular for producing the vase needed by tightfisted when the target next does not already exist.\n\n3) Consequence: circular dependencies for goals that require next(...,object_6) or next(...,object_8)\n- Example: target next(object_11,object_6). The only operators that can add next(object_11,object_6) are tightfisted (needs vase(object_11,o1) and next(o1,object_6) with o1 a sneeze node) or paltry (but paltry cannot add next(...,object_6) as explained in (1)). For tightfisted we would need a vase(object_11,o1) where o1 must be a sneeze node with next(o1,object_6) (the only such o1 initially is object_3 since next(object_3,object_6) holds). To get vase(object_11,object_3) we can only use clip or sip. sip can't create vase(...,object_3) because cats only holds for object_0. clip requires next(object_11, some_o2) and next(object_3, same_o2) — in particular clip(object_11,object_3,6) would require next(object_11,6) already. That is circular: you cannot create vase(object_11,object_3) without the next(object_11,6) you were trying to create. No other operator gives vase(object_11,object_3). Therefore next(object_11,object_6) is impossible.\n\n- The same circularity applies to next(object_10,object_8) and next(object_12,object_8): to make next(object_10,8) via tightfisted you need vase(object_10,o1) where o1 is a sneeze node that already points to 8 (object_4). But creating vase(object_10,4) via clip would require next(object_10,8) already. sip cannot make such vase (cats constraint). paltry cannot make next(...,8) because paltry is limited to object_5/object_7 targets as above. So next(object_10,8) is unreachable. Similar reasoning for object_12.\n\n- For next(object_9,object_5): paltry could make next(object_9,5) only if vase(object_9,object_0) exists (paltry requires cats(object_0)), and vase(object_9,object_0) can only be made by sip( object_9, object_0, o2 ) which requires next(object_9,o2) already — again circular. tightfisted would require vase(object_9,o1) for some sneeze o1 that has next(o1,5); but initially there is no sneeze node pointing to 5 (object_3 points to 6 not 5; object_4 points to 8). You can make object_3 point to 5 by a wretched(3,6,5,1) but then you still need vase(object_9,3). To make vase(object_9,3) via clip you would again need next(object_9,5) already (circular). So next(object_9,5) is also unreachable.\n\n4) Conclusion\nBecause each goal next(...) value either requires making a vase that can only be produced if that next already exists, or requires paltry to produce a next that paltry cannot produce (paltry can only produce next(...,object_5) or next(...,object_7)), the four required facts (next 10 8, next 11 6, next 12 8, next 9 5) cannot be simultaneously achieved from the given initial state with the provided operators.\n\nIf you want, I can:\n- produce a short witness showing the circular dependencies for each goal in more formal detail, or\n- propose a modified initial condition (e.g. add a vase or extra sneeze/collect/spring事实) that would make the goal achievable, or\n- search for a maximal subset of the goals that is actually achievable and produce a plan attaining those.

I can produce valid steps that achieve some of the goals (11→9 and 13→9), and I can explain precisely why the remaining two (10→6 and 12→7) are blocked by the operators’ precondition structure and the available collect/spring facts.\n\nWhat I can do for you now\n- I give a small, correct subplan that achieves next object_13 object_9 and next object_11 object_9 (both are doable).\n- I then show why next object_10 object_6 and next object_12 object_7 cannot be established given the initial facts and the action schemas.\n\nSubplan that achieves next object_13 object_9 and next object_11 object_9\n(Every action below is applicable given the second initial state you gave; I show the intuitive purpose of each step.)\n\n1) sip object_13 object_0 object_6\n   - Uses: hand 13, cats 0, texture 6, next 13 6, next 0 6\n   - Effect: creates vase(13,0) and deletes next(13,6)\n   - Purpose: create a vase between hand 13 and cat 0 so we can later move 13 away and use the vase for later manipulations.\n\n2) memory object_0 object_6 object_8\n   - Uses: cats 0, spring 6, spring 8, next 0 6\n   - Effect: adds next(0,8), deletes next(0,6)\n   - Purpose: move cat 0’s pointer from 6 to 8 so paltry can later put 13 to 8.\n\n3) paltry object_13 object_0 object_8\n   - Uses: hand 13, cats 0, texture 8, vase(13,0), next(0,8)\n   - Effect: adds next(13,8), deletes vase(13,0)\n   - Purpose: place 13 → 8.\n\n4) wretched object_5 object_9 object_8 object_3\n   - Uses: sneeze 5, texture 9, texture 8, stupendous 3, next 5 9, collect 9 3, collect 8 3\n   - Effect: adds next(5,8), deletes next(5,9)\n   - Purpose: move sneeze 5 from 9 to 8 (we will use 5 as the sneeze partner to make a vase for 13 and 11).\n\n5) clip object_13 object_5 object_8\n   - Uses: hand 13, sneeze 5, texture 8, next 5 8, next 13 8\n   - Effect: adds vase(13,5), deletes next(13,8)\n   - Purpose: create vase between hand 13 and sneeze 5 (we need a vase with sneeze 5 to use tightfisted).\n\n6) wretched object_5 object_8 object_9 object_3\n   - Uses: sneeze 5, texture 8, texture 9, stupendous 3, next 5 8, collect 8 3, collect 9 3\n   - Effect: adds next(5,9), deletes next(5,8)\n   - Purpose: move sneeze 5 back to 9 so tightfisted can use next(5,9).\n\n7) tightfisted object_13 object_5 object_9\n   - Uses: hand 13, sneeze 5, texture 9, next 5 9, vase(13,5)\n   - Effect: adds next(13,9), deletes vase(13,5)\n   - Result: next object_13 object_9 is achieved.\n\nNow do the same style for object_11 (similar pattern):\n\n8) wretched object_5 object_9 object_8 object_3\n   - (again move 5 → 8 so clip on 11 can create vase(11,5))\n   - Effect: adds next(5,8), deletes next(5,9)\n\n9) clip object_11 object_5 object_8\n   - Uses: hand 11, sneeze 5, texture 8, next 5 8, next 11 8\n   - Effect: adds vase(11,5), deletes next(11,8)\n\n10) wretched object_5 object_8 object_9 object_3\n   - Move 5 back to 9: adds next(5,9), deletes next(5,8)\n\n11) tightfisted object_11 object_5 object_9\n   - Uses: hand 11, sneeze 5, texture 9, next 5 9, vase(11,5)\n   - Effect: adds next(11,9), deletes vase(11,5)\n   - Result: next object_11 object_9 is achieved.\n\nSo steps (1)–(7) produced next(13,9); steps (8)–(11) produced next(11,9). (There is some reuse of the sneeze 5 moves; the exact interleaving above is one valid ordering.)\n\nWhy next object_10 object_6 and next object_12 object_7 are not achievable (explanation)\nI searched for ways to get next(10,6) and next(12,7) and ran into unavoidable precondition deadlocks caused by the way vases are created and by the collect/spring structure:\n\n- To add next(H, X) for a hand H the only operators that can create next with subject = a hand are paltry and tightfisted. Both require a vase(H, Y) to exist at the time you add the new next(H, X):\n  - paltry requires vase(H, catY) and next(catY, X)\n  - tightfisted requires vase(H, sneezeY) and next(sneezeY, X)\n\n- A vase(H, Y) is only created by clip or sip:\n  - clip(H, sneezeY, a) requires next(H,a) and next(sneezeY,a)\n  - sip(H, catsY, a) requires next(H,a) and next(catsY,a)\n  Both of these require next(H,a) to exist before the vase can be made.\n\nSo creating a vase(H, Y) that will be useful to get H→X typically requires that H already point at some a that Y also points at. Then clip/sip can create the vase at that shared target a, removing next(H,a). After that you can move Y to X (if allowed), then use paltry/tightfisted to place H→X. That pattern works only when:\n  (i) there exists an object Y that can be moved (via available operators) to point to the desired target X, and\n  (ii) there exists a common target a initially shared by H and Y so that the required vase can be created.\n\nWhen you examine the specific desires:\n\n- For next(10,6):\n  - Initially 10→9. To create a vase(10,Y) we need some Y that also points to 9. Which Y point to 9 initially? Only 5 and 12 point to 9 initially (and 10 itself). Y must be a sneeze (for tightfisted) or a cat (for paltry).\n  - sneeze objects are 4 and 5. Only sneeze 5 initially points to 9. So we could create vase(10,5) by clip(10,5,9). That deletes 10→9 and gives vase(10,5). To use tightfisted(10,5,6) we need next(5,6). But 5 cannot be moved from 9 to 6 because wretched can move 5 from 9 only to textures whose collect partner shares the same collect index: collect(9,3) and collect(6,2) have different second arguments, so the required wretched preconditions to go 9→6 do not hold. In short: 5 can move between 9 and 8 (both collect * 3) but not to 6 (collect * 2). Therefore you cannot get next(5,6) → tightfisted(10,5,6) is impossible.\n  - Trying cats: cats 0 and 1 point to 6 initially. But to create vase(10,cat) via sip we must have next(10,a) and next(cat,a). The only a equal to next(10,*) initially is 9, but cat0 or cat1 do not point to 9. There is no operator that moves a cat to 9 (memory only moves cats between springs 6 and 8). So you cannot create a vase(10,catY) that pairs 10 with a cat that can later be made to point to 6 in a way needed by paltry. The circular dependencies cannot be broken with the available collect/spring facts.\n  - Therefore next(10,6) cannot be produced.\n\n- For next(12,7):\n  - Initially 12→9. There is a sneeze 4 that already points to 7 (good), so if we could create vase(12,4) we could use tightfisted(12,4,7). But a vase(12,4) requires that 12 and 4 currently point to the same a; initially 12→9 and 4→7, so no shared a. You could try to move 4 to 9 or 12 to 7 first, but operators that move sneeze pointers have the same collect-index constraint. In particular, to move 4 from 7 to 9 you would need collect(7,o3) and collect(9,o3) for the same o3; collect(7,2) and collect(9,3) do not match. So 4 cannot be moved to 9, nor can 12 be moved to 7 without a vase that depends on a shared target. All attempts lead to circular requirements that cannot be satisfied.\n  - Therefore next(12,7) cannot be produced.\n\nSummary\n- A valid plan exists that yields next object_13 object_9 and next object_11 object_9; I gave one above (11 actions for object_13 and 3–4 for object_11; they can be interleaved).\n- Given the initial facts and the operator preconditions/effects, next object_10 object_6 and next object_12 object_7 are not achievable: the required intermediate pointer moves for the needed sneeze/cat objects are blocked by the collect/spring structure (no operator chain can establish the required preconditions).\n\nIf you want\n- I can output the full linearized plan for achieving the two achievable goals (11→9 and 13→9) in a compact action list.\n- Or I can try an automated search to double-check exhaustively (takes a bit longer) and return either a full plan if one exists or a counterexample proof that no full plan exists. Which would you prefer?",

So we must produce some vase(11,Y).\n\n- vase(11,Y) can only be produced by clip or sip.\n  - sip(11,Y,T) requires next(11,T) and next(Y,T) (and cats(Y) etc.) — it therefore requires next(11,T) already.\n  - clip(11,Y,T) requires next(11,T) and next(Y,T) (and sneeze(Y), texture(T)). So both clip and sip need some existing next(11,T).\n  - The only existing next with first argument 11 in the initial state is next(11,6). So any clip/sip that can make vase(11,Y) must use T = 6 and therefore requires next(Y,6).\n\n- So we must produce next(Y,6) for some Y with sneeze(Y) (clip requires sneeze(Y)). The only objects with sneeze are 3 and 4, so Y must be 3 or 4.\n\n- From the initial next facts:\n  - next(3,7) is the only next for 3; next(4,8) is the only next for 4.\n  - wretched can change next(o0, o1) → next(o0, o2) only when o1 and o2 are in the same collect-group (and o0 has sneeze). Collect-groups here are {5,6,7} (with stupendous 1) and {8,9,10} (with stupendous 2).\n  - Thus:\n    - For o0 = 3 (next(3,7) initially, 7 ∈ {5,6,7}) wretched can make next(3,6) or next(3,5), but it cannot make next(3,10) because 10 ∉ {5,6,7}.\n    - For o0 = 4 (next(4,8) initially, 8 ∈ {8,9,10}) wretched can make next(4,9) or next(4,10), but that helps only to make vase(11,4) via clip if next(11,9) or next(11,10) already existed — circular.\n\n- Therefore the only viable route to get vase(11,Y) is:\n  1) make next(3,6) via wretched(3,7,6,1), then\n  2) clip(11,3,6) to get vase(11,3) (since next(11,6) exists initially).\n  But after that, both paltry(11,3,10) and tightfisted(11,3,10) need next(3,10), which is impossible to produce for object 3 because 3's next can only move within {5,6,7}, never to 10.\n\n- There is no other way to obtain the required preconditions (cats(11) or sneeze(11) are not available and cannot be produced), so next(11,10) is unreachable.\n\nConclusion: no plan exists from the given initial state to achieve next object_11 object_10.",

      "response": "I checked the available actions, their preconditions/effects, and the second initial state. Conclusion: there is no valid plan from the given initial state that achieves both goals next object_11 object_7 and next object_12 object_5. Below is a concise explanation / proof sketch showing why each goal cannot be reached with the available operators.\n\nWhich operators can add a next(x,y) fact?\n- wretched(sneeze, t1, t2, stup) — adds next(sneeze, t2)\n- memory(cats, spring1, spring2) — adds next(cats, spring2)\n- tightfisted(hand, sneeze, texture) — adds next(hand, texture) (requires vase(hand, sneeze) and next(sneeze, texture))\n- paltry(hand, cats, texture) — adds next(hand, texture) (requires vase(hand, cats) and next(cats, texture))\n\nThus to get next(11,7) the only possibilities are:\n- paltry(11, cats=0, 7) — needs vase(11,0) and next(0,7). next(0,7) is not present initially; memory is the only action that can change next(0,·) and memory(0,5,8) can only change next(0,5) → next(0,8) (springs available are 5 and 8). There is no way to produce next(0,7). So paltry(11,0,7) is impossible.\n- tightfisted(11, s, 7) for some sneeze s (s ∈ {3,4}) — needs vase(11,s) and next(s,7).\n  - We can make next(3,7) by wretched(3,6,7,1) (collect(6,1) and collect(7,1) and next(3,6) are present), so next(3,7) is achievable.\n  - But tightfisted(11,3,7) additionally requires vase(11,3). The only way to get vase(11,3) is:\n    - clip(11,3,t) which needs next(3,t) and next(11,t) for the same t, or\n    - sip(11,0,t) which would create vase(11,0) (not vase(11,3)) and requires next(11,t) and next(0,t) for same t.\n  - Initially next(11,9) and next(3,6). There is no t that makes next(3,t) and next(11,t) true simultaneously initially. You can make next(3,9) by wretched only if collect(6,?) and collect(9,?) share the same stupendous, but they do not (collect(6,1) vs collect(9,2)). So you cannot produce a t that allows clip(11,3,t). The other route (sip) would produce vase(11,0) only if next(11,t) and next(0,t) match; next(0,5) and next(11,9) do not match, and next(0,·) can only be changed to 8 via memory(0,5,8) — still no match to 9. All attempts lead to circular requirements (you need a next you are trying to create to enable the operation that would produce the vase required to create it). Therefore vase(11,s) cannot be produced in a way that lets you then do tightfisted(11,s,7).\n\nHence next(11,7) is unreachable.\n\nFor next(12,5) the analogous analysis:\n- paltry(12,0,5) would need vase(12,0) and next(0,5). next(0,5) exists initially, but vase(12,0) can only be created by sip(12,0,t) which requires next(12,t) and next(0,t) for the same t. Initially next(12,10) and next(0,5) differ; next(0,·) can only become 8 (memory), so you cannot match next(12,t) to next(0,t) without already having the target next you are trying to create. Circular again.\n- tightfisted(12,s,5) would need vase(12,s) and next(s,5). You can make vase(12,4) by first doing wretched(4,8,10,2) to get next(4,10) and then clip(12,4,10) (that yields vase(12,4)), but tightfisted(12,4,5) then requires next(4,5). Producing next(4,5) would require wretched(4,10,5,o3) for some o3 where collect(10,o3) and collect(5,o3) both hold; no such common o3 exists (collect(10,2), collect(5,1)), so next(4,5) cannot be produced. The other sneeze (3) can get next(3,5) by wretched(3,6,5,1), but then you would need vase(12,3). Creating vase(12,3) requires a shared texture t with next(12,t) and next(3,t) — there is no way to create such a t without already creating next(12,5) (again circular) or matching collects that do not exist. So next(12,5) is also unreachable.\n\nBecause both subgoals require vases between a hand and a cats/sneeze that cannot be produced without already having matching next facts that are being sought, and because the collect/stupendous rules block the necessary wretched changes to align those next facts, there is no sequence of allowed actions that produces next(11,7) and next(12,5) from the given initial state.\n\nIf you want, I can:\n- produce a short counterexample plan search trace that fails (showing the circular dependencies), or\n- try a relaxed variant of the problem (e.g., allow adding or changing some collect/stupendous facts) to produce a feasible plan, or\n- search for a plan that achieves one of the two goals (if you only need one).

Key points of the reasoning (sketch):\n\n- The only actions that can add a next relation with first argument = object_13 are paltry and tightfisted (they add next a c where a is the first argument). memory/wretched require the first argument to be cats / sneeze respectively; object_13 is neither cats nor sneeze in the initial state, so only paltry/tightfisted can ever add a next for object_13.\n\n- Both paltry and tightfisted require that a vase involving object_13 already exists (paltry needs vase object_13 b with b a cats; tightfisted needs vase object_13 b with b a sneeze). A vase object_13 b can only be created by clip or sip.\n\n- clip and sip both require next object_13 c to be already true (they need next a c in their preconditions). That means you cannot create a vase object_13 b unless some next object_13 c already exists. There is one such initial next: next object_13 object_7. So any vase you can create for object_13 must be created with c = object_7.\n\n- If you create vase object_13 b using c = object_7:\n  - clip produces vase object_13 b for b that is a sneeze object and requires next b object_7. You can make next 4 7 (wretched 4 8 7 2), so clip can produce vase object_13 object_4, but object_4 is not a cats object, so paltry (which needs b to be cats and next b 9) cannot use that vase.\n  - sip could produce vase object_13 b only if b is a cats object and next b object_7 holds. But the cats objects are only object_0 and object_1, and neither has next to object_7 initially, nor can any available action add next object_0 object_7 or next object_1 object_7 without losing their required next-to-9 link (memory would move their next but deletes the previous next). Thus you cannot obtain a vase object_13 b where b is a cat and next b 9 remains available for paltry.\n\n- Because paltry (which would use a cats b with next b 9 to set next object_13 object_9) cannot get the required vase for a cats b, and tightfisted (which would use a sneeze b with next b 9) cannot be applied because no sneeze object initially has next to 9 (and making such a next for a sneeze object either destroys the needed other preconditions or cannot bootstrap without already having next object_13 to the needed c), there is no viable sequence that produces next object_13 object_9 from the given initial facts.\n\nConclusion\n- A valid plan to achieve next object_12 object_10 is:\n  1) clip object_12 object_5 object_11\n  2) wretched object_5 object_11 object_10 object_3\n  3) tightfisted object_12 object_5 object_10\n\n- Given the available actions and initial facts, next object_13 object_9 is unreachable; no sequence of the allowed actions can produce it (as sketched above). If you want, I can produce a more detailed step-by-step unreachable-proof (covering all action classes and cases) or try alternate weaker goals for object_13.",

      "response": "Short answer: The full goal (next object_11 object_8, next object_12 object_8, next object_13 object_10) is not achievable from the given initial state. I can show why and also give the maximal reachable change (we can achieve next object_11 object_8) and the short sequence that does that.\n\nWhy the full goal is impossible\n- The only operators that can add a next fact with a hand as the first argument are paltry and tightfisted (they add next object_0 object_2 where object_0 is a hand). Both require a vase fact vase object_0 object_1 as a precondition.\n- A vase fact can only be produced by clip or sip. Both clip and sip require next object_0 object_2 (i.e. require an existing next fact for the same hand object_0) in their preconditions. In other words, to create vase for a hand object you already need that hand to have a next-to-some-texture fact.\n- Therefore for a hand node that does not already share a texture-successor with some sneeze/cats node, you cannot bootstrap a new next for that hand: creating the vase you would need is circular (requires the hand's next already).\n- In the given initial state:\n  - object_11 already has next object_11 object_10 and there exists sneeze object_4 with next object_4 object_10 — so we can create vase(11,4) and then change the successors by using wretched/tightfisted. So next object_11 object_8 is reachable.\n  - object_12 has next object_12 object_6, but there is no sneeze node that currently has next -> 6 (sneeze nodes are 3 and 4, their nexts are 3->7 and 4->10). Although we can change sneeze 3 or 4, there is no way to produce the specific combination of collects/springs needed to move a sneeze node to 8 while simultaneously producing a vase for 12; attempts to do the necessary intermediate steps run into the same circular vase/next dependency. So next object_12 object_8 cannot be produced.\n  - object_13 has next object_13 object_9; there is no appropriate sneeze node that both has next -> 10 and is sneeze (or other arrangement) that would let us create a vase linking 13 to such a sneeze node; creating vase(13,...) runs into the same circular dependence. Thus next object_13 object_10 cannot be produced.\n\nTherefore no plan can achieve all three goal facts simultaneously.\n\nFeasible partial plan (achieves next object_11 object_8)\nIf you are interested in the reachable part, here is a valid sequence that achieves next object_11 object_8 (but it does not produce the other two required facts):\n\n1) clip object_11 object_4 object_10\n   - Pre satisfied: hand(11), sneeze(4), texture(10), next(4,10), next(11,10)\n   - Effects: vase(11,4) becomes true; next(11,10) is deleted.\n\n2) wretched object_4 object_10 object_8 object_2\n   - Pre satisfied: sneeze(4), texture(10), texture(8), stupendous(2), next(4,10), collect(10,2), collect(8,2)\n   - Effects: next(4,8) becomes true; next(4,10) is deleted.\n\n3) tightfisted object_11 object_4 object_8\n   - Pre satisfied after steps above: hand(11), sneeze(4), texture(8), next(4,8), vase(11,4)\n   - Effects: next(11,8) becomes true; vase(11,4) is deleted.\n\nAfter these three actions you will have next object_11 object_8 (and you will no longer have next 11->10). The other two required next facts (next 12->8 and next 13->10) remain unachievable as explained.\n\nIf you want, I can:\n- produce a formal proof of impossibility (trace of why every relevant operator chain is circular),\n- try to find any alternative weaker goal set that is jointly achievable,\n- or search again if you can allow adding an initial vase or an extra collect/spring/sneeze/cats fact (i.e., change the initial facts) — with a small change the full goal may become achievable.

      "response": "I checked the possible actions and effects and found the goal (next 11 5, next 12 9, next 13 10) cannot be reached from the given initial state. Reasoning (sketch):\n\n1) Which actions can add next facts for a hand H?\n   - paltry(H, X, T) adds next H T but requires X to be a cats object and next X T to already hold. Here the only cats object is object_0, and next object_0 can only ever be 8 or 5 (memory only swaps the cat's next between springs 8 and 5). So paltry can only produce next H 8 or next H 5 — it cannot produce next H 9 or next H 10.\n   - tightfisted(H, s, T) adds next H T but requires (a) a vase(H, s) and (b) next s T (s must be a sneeze object). So producing next H T via tightfisted requires some sneeze s that already can have next s T and also a vase(H, s).\n\n2) For next 12 9:\n   - The only sneeze that can have next ... 9 is object_4 (object_3's nexts are limited to the st=1 group {5,6,7}; object_4's next can be in the st=2 group {8,9,10}). Thus tightfisted to produce next 12 9 would need vase(12, 4).\n   - vase(12,4) can be produced only by clip(12,4,o2) (clip produces vase(hand,sneeze)). clip(12,4,o2) requires next 12 o2 and next 4 o2 to both hold for some o2.\n   - In the initial state next 12 = 7 and next 4 ∈ {8,9,10} (it starts as 9 and can be changed only among {8,9,10}). There is no o2 that belongs to both sets, so clip cannot create vase(12,4).\n   - sip cannot create vase(12,4) because sip creates vase(hand, O) only when O is a cats object; object_4 is not cats.\n   - paltry cannot create next 12 9 (see point 1).\n   => next 12 9 is impossible.\n\n3) For next 13 10:\n   - By the same argument, only object_4 can reach 10 (object_3 is confined to {5,6,7}), so tightfisted to get next 13 10 would need vase(13,4).\n   - Creating vase(13,4) by clip requires a shared o2 with next13 and next4, but next13 = 7 and next4 ∈ {8,9,10} — no intersection. sip cannot produce vase(13,4). paltry cannot produce 10 for a hand.\n   => next 13 10 is impossible.\n\n4) next 11 5 alone might be reachable (paltry or tightfisted paths can give 5), but because two required target facts (next 12 9 and next 13 10) are unreachable, the whole goal conjunction is unreachable.\n\nConclusion: there is no valid plan that achieves the goal next object_11 object_5, next object_12 object_9 and next object_13 object_10 from the given initial state. If you want, I can:\n- produce a proof trace that focuses on the impossibility of next 12 9 / next 13 10, or\n- search for a maximal achievable subset of the three goals and give a plan for those reachable parts (for example, next 11 5 may be achievable), or\n- suggest minimal changes to the initial facts (e.g., making next 12 point to a value in {8,9,10} or adding a collect/vase that bridges groups) so the goal becomes achievable.

(We temporarily change next object_0 to object_5 to create vase object_12 object_0 via sip, then restore next object_0 object_8 with a second memory, so paltry can use next object_0 object_8.)\n- Steps 9–12 produce next object_13 object_5 (as required).\n\nWhy next object_14 object_7 is unreachable from the given initial state\n- The only actions that can set a \"next\" relation for a hand object (like object_14) are paltry and tightfisted (they add next object_0 object_2) and those both require as a precondition either:\n  - paltry: vase object_0 object_1 where object_1 must be a cats object (only object_0 in the problem), plus next object_1 object_2 (so paltry for object_14 would require next object_0 <target>), or\n  - tightfisted: vase object_0 sneeze and next sneeze <target>.\n- To make next object_14 object_7 via tightfisted you would need to have a vase object_14 3 (sneeze = object_3) and next object_3 object_7. next object_3 object_7 is attainable (object_3 is sneeze and through wretched can take values {5,6,7}), so that part is OK.\n- The blocker is creating vase object_14 object_3. The only action that creates vase object_14 X is clip (or sip, but sip needs cats X and cats exist only for object_0). clip requires next object_14 A and next object_3 A for the same A. But object_14's initial next is in the collect-group-2 textures (object_9), while object_3's nexts belong to collect-group-1 textures (5,6,7). There is no way, under the given collect facts, to make object_14's current next value fall into the same group as object_3's next value required by clip without already having a vase for object_14 (circular) or cats on object_3 (not available).\n- In short: the domain constraints (collect-group partitioning and available sneeze/cats facts) and the available actions produce a structural barrier: you cannot create the required vase object_14 object_3, so tightfisted/paltry cannot be used to set next object_14 object_7. I checked the natural alternative routes (paltry via cats/object_0, sip to create vase, various clip/wretched sequences) and each is blocked by the same partitioning/circularity.\n\nIf you want to make next object_14 object_7 reachable, one of these changes would help (examples):\n- add collect facts that put object_9 and object_7 into the same collect-group (so wretched on a sneeze could connect them), or\n- add a cats fact for object_3 (so sip could create vase object_14 object_3), or\n- give object_14 an initial next in the same collect-group as object_3 so clip could create vase object_14 object_3 directly.\n\nIf you want, I can:\n- produce the plan in a different format,\n- show the state after each step (to verify pre/postconditions),\n- or search for an alternative proof that next object_14 object_7 is unreachable given the exact constraints.",

      "response": "I checked the domain rules and the given initial state against the goal (next 11 10, next 12 6, next 13 10, next 14 7). No valid action sequence can achieve that goal from the provided initial state. The blocking reasons are structural (they do not depend on the order of actions) — here is a concise explanation showing why each goal atom is unreachable.\n\nKey observations about the actions and initial facts\n- Only objects with sneeze (initially object_3 and object_4), cats (only object_0), or being a hand (objects 11–14) can be the subject (first argument) of actions that add or change next facts:\n  - memory only changes next for the cats object (object_0) and only between spring-labeled targets (springs are only object_5 and object_8).\n  - wretched changes next for sneeze objects (3 and 4) but requires particular collect relations.\n  - paltry and tightfisted can add next for hands, but each has strong additional preconditions (vase facts and/or next facts for some other object).\n- Vase facts can only be created by sip or clip. Both sip and clip require the next facts they would later help change to already exist for the same z (they require next x z in the precondition). That makes creating certain vase pairs circular unless the corresponding next facts already exist for other objects that satisfy required preconditions (e.g., a sneeze object with next to the needed z).\n\nWhy next(object_11, object_10) is impossible\n- To add next(11,10) for a hand 11 we only have two relevant creators:\n  - paltry(11, y=object_0, 10) would require next(0,10). But memory (the only action changing next for object_0) can only swap next(0,5) and next(0,8) because spring objects are only 5 and 8. So next(0,10) cannot be produced.\n  - tightfisted(11, y, 10) would require some sneeze y with next(y,10) and vase(11,y). The only sneeze objects are 3 and 4. Only object_4 has next(4,10) initially, so y would have to be 4. But to create vase(11,4) by clip or sip you need next(11,10) already true (both clip and sip require next(11,z) with the same z), so creating vase(11,4) is circular on next(11,10). Therefore next(11,10) cannot be made.\n\nWhy next(object_12, object_6) is impossible\n- To add next(12,6) we could try paltry(12,0,6) (needs next(0,6) — impossible because memory only yields 5 or 8) or tightfisted(12,y,6) (needs sneeze y and next(y,6) and vase(12,y)).\n- Which y have next(y,6) initially? object_11 and object_13 do. But neither is a sneeze object (sneeze only for 3 and 4) and we cannot create sneeze facts. So the tightfisted route is blocked.\n- There is no other action that can introduce next(12,6) given available preconditions. Thus next(12,6) cannot be achieved.\n\nWhy next(object_13, object_10) is impossible\n- Same style of argument: paltry would require next(0,10) (impossible), tightfisted would require a sneeze y with next(y,10) plus vase(13,y). Only y=4 has next(4,10) and is a sneeze, but vase(13,4) cannot be produced without already having next(13,10) (again circular). So next(13,10) cannot be achieved.\n\nWhy next(object_14, object_7) is impossible\n- paltry(14,0,7) needs next(0,7) — memory cannot produce 7 (only 5 or 8). tightfisted requires some sneeze y with next(y,7); no such next(y,7) exists initially and nothing can create it without requiring the very next facts we want. So next(14,7) cannot be achieved.\n\nConclusion\nBecause each of the four required next facts is blocked by circular preconditions or by the domain constraints (memory can only move next(0,·) between spring-labeled targets 5 and 8; only objects 3 and 4 are sneeze and they only support a limited set of wretched outcomes based on collect facts), the goal set is unreachable from the given initial state. Therefore no valid plan exists.\n\nIf you want I can:\n- (a) search for a maximal subset of the goal that is reachable and produce a plan for that subset, or\n- (b) try to generate a concrete counterexample trace showing where any attempted construction breaks, or\n- (c) propose minimal changes to initial facts (e.g., add a collect or spring or make some other object sneeze) that would make the full goal achievable and then produce a plan.\n\nWhich of those would you like me to do?",

      "response": "I checked the possible ways to achieve each required final fact. The other three goals (next 13 7, next 14 11, next 15 8) might be addressable, but there is a fundamental impossibility for next 12 11, which makes the whole goal set unattainable. Short proof:\n\n1) Which operators can add next(12,11)?\n   - paltry(12, b, 11) adds next(12,11) (paltry requires hand 12).\n   - tightfisted(12, b, 11) also adds next(12,11) (tightfisted requires hand 12).\n   - memory and wretched cannot add next for 12 because memory only adds next for a cats object, and wretched only adds next for a sneeze object; 12 is a hand, so only paltry/tightfisted are relevant.\n\n2) paltry(12,b,11) requires:\n   - cats(b) and next(b,11) and vase(12,b).\n   - cats(b) means b ∈ {0,1} (given cats are object_0 and object_1).\n   - So we would need next(0,11) or next(1,11). But next for cats (0 and 1) can only be changed by memory. Memory can only move a cat's next between spring objects (the operator requires spring b and spring c), and the springs available in the instance are object_6 and object_9. Thus a cat's next can only ever be object_6 or object_9 — it cannot become object_11. Therefore next(b,11) for any cat b is impossible, so paltry cannot produce next(12,11).\n\n3) tightfisted(12,b,11) requires:\n   - sneeze(b), next(b,11), vase(12,b), texture(11).\n   - The only sneeze objects are b ∈ {4,5}. Among them only object_5 has next(5,11) initially (object_4 has next(4,6)).\n   - So b would have to be 5. Then we need vase(12,5).\n   - Vases with a sneeze-second-parameter (vase(_,5)) can only be created by clip(...,5, c). clip(a,5,c) requires next(5,c) and next(a,c) simultaneously (so clip produces vase(a,5) only if there is a shared c with next(5,c) and next(a,c)).\n   - Initially next(5,11) and next(12,7) — there is no shared c. Could we make next(5,?) match next(12,7)=7 so clip(12,5,7) would work? That would require next(5,7).\n   - The only operator that can change next(5,11) is wretched with a=5. But wretched(5,b,c,d) requires collect(b,d) and collect(c,d) for the same d. To change next 5 from 11 to 7 we would need a wretched that has b=11 and c=7 with some d such that collect(11,d) and collect(7,d) both hold. In the initial state collect(11,3) is present and collect(7,2) is present — there is no common d, so no such wretched is possible. There is no other operator that can turn next(5,11) into next(5,7). Therefore we cannot make next(5) equal to next(12) so we cannot create vase(12,5) by clip, hence cannot get tightfisted(12,5,11).\n\nBecause neither paltry nor tightfisted can produce next(12,11) under the given initial facts and operators, next(12,11) is unreachable. Since that goal literal is unreachable, the overall goal set {next 12 11, next 13 7, next 14 11, next 15 8} is unattainable from the given initial state.\n\nIf you want, I can:\n- try to produce a maximal subset of the goals that is achievable and give a plan for those reachable facts, or\n- suggest minimal changes to the initial state (e.g., add a collect or a spring or a sneeze) that would make the full goal reachable and then produce a plan.

      "response": "Summary: I checked reachability from your second initial state. Hands 12 and 13 can be moved to their goal targets (next 12 11 and next 13 8). However, given the available operators and the initial grouping of textures, reaching next 14 10 and next 15 9 is impossible from the given initial facts. I show a correct partial plan (for 12 and 13), then explain why 14 and 15 cannot be achieved and suggest minimal changes that would make the full goal reachable.\n\nPartial plan that achieves next 12 11 and next 13 8 (in order):\n\n1) wretched object_4 object_7 object_6 object_2\n   - Changes next 4 from 7 -> 6.\n   - Preconditions satisfied (sneeze4, textures7&6, stupendous2, next4 7, collect7 2, collect6 2).\n\n2) clip object_13 object_4 object_6\n   - Creates vase(13,4) and deletes next13 6.\n   - Preconditions satisfied (hand13, sneeze4, texture6, next4 6 (after step 1), next13 6 (initial)).\n\n3) wretched object_4 object_6 object_8 object_2\n   - Changes next 4 from 6 -> 8.\n   - Preconditions satisfied (sneeze4, textures6&8, stupendous2, next4 6, collect6 2, collect8 2).\n\n4) tightfisted object_13 object_4 object_8\n   - Adds next13 8 (goal for 13) and removes vase(13,4).\n   - Preconditions satisfied (hand13, sneeze4, texture8, next4 8, vase13 4).\n\n5) clip object_12 object_5 object_9\n   - Creates vase(12,5) and deletes next12 9.\n   - Preconditions satisfied (hand12, sneeze5, texture9, next5 9 (initial), next12 9 (initial)).\n\n6) wretched object_5 object_9 object_11 object_3\n   - Changes next5 from 9 -> 11.\n   - Preconditions satisfied (sneeze5, textures9&11, stupendous3, next5 9, collect9 3, collect11 3).\n\n7) tightfisted object_12 object_5 object_11\n   - Adds next12 11 (goal for 12) and removes vase(12,5).\n   - Preconditions satisfied (hand12, sneeze5, texture11, next5 11, vase12 5).\n\nAfter step 7 you have next12 11 and next13 8 as required.\n\nWhy next 14 10 and next 15 9 are unreachable from the given initial state\n- Sneeze object_4 can only ever have next belonging to the texture set {6,7,8} because collect(6,2), collect(7,2), collect(8,2) exist with the same stupendous object_2; wretched only moves a sneeze's next between textures that share the same collect-stupendous grouping.\n- Sneeze object_5 is confined to the texture set {9,10,11} (collect 9/10/11 with stupendous 3).\n- The only way to make a hand h get next h T is via paltry or tightfisted; both require an existing vase(h, X) and tightfisted requires next X T where X is a sneeze. A vase(h, s) is created by clip(h, s, T) but clip requires next h T and next s T already to hold (i.e. both must already share T).\n- This implies the clip -> tightfisted pattern requires that a hand's current next be in the same texture set as the sneeze you plan to use (so you can create the vase by clip using that shared texture), and then you can change the sneeze's next within its collect-group and do tightfisted to set the hand to some other texture in that same group.\n\nApplying these constraints to your specific hands:\n- hand14 starts with next14 = 7 (group {6,7,8}). Its goal 10 is in the other group {9,10,11}. There is no operator that moves a hand from a texture in group2 to a texture in group3 except via tightfisted using a sneeze in group3 — but to create the necessary vase with a group3 sneeze (sneeze5) you'd need clip(14,5,T) with T common to both 14 and 5 to create vase(14,5). There is no T common (next14=7, next5=9 initially), and sneeze5 cannot be changed to 7 (its group excludes 7). So hand14 cannot be moved into group {9,10,11} from its starting 7.\n- hand15 starts with next15 = 6 (group {6,7,8}). Its goal 9 is in the other group; same argument shows you cannot bridge the groups for hand15 either.\n\nSo with the given initial facts, there is no sequence of legal actions that yields next14 10 or next15 9.\n\nHow to make the full goal reachable (suggested minimal fixes)\n- If one of the following were true, full goal becomes reachable:\n  - initial next14 is already in {9,10,11} (so clip with sneeze5 could create a vase and then you can change sneeze5 to 10 and tightfisted to set hand14 to 10), or\n  - initial next15 is already in {9,10,11}, or\n  - an additional sneeze that belongs to group {9,10,11} had an initial next matching 7 or 6 (so you could create the vase for hand14 or hand15 respectively).\n- Concretely, if initial next14 were 9 (instead of 7), then steps analogous to the 12->11 sequence (using sneeze5) would let you make next14 10.\n\nIf you want, I can:\n- produce a fully expanded action sequence (with all preconditions/effects checked step-by-step) for the partial plan (12 & 13) above; or\n- propose concrete minimal changes to the initial facts and give a full plan that achieves all four goal next relations under those modified initials.

      "response": "I cannot produce a valid plan — the goal set is unreachable from the given initial facts. The blocker is next object_11 object_7 (next 11 7); the other goal atoms are either already true (next 13 8) or can be reached by the kinds of operations available, but next 11 7 cannot be produced with the available predicates and action schemas.\n\nConcise reason (minimal sound proof of impossibility):\n\n- The only actions that can add a next relation whose subject is object_11 are paltry(object_0 object_1 object_2) and tightfisted(object_0 object_1 object_2) because memory requires the subject to be cats and wretched requires the subject to be sneeze. object_11 is initially a hand (hand object_11), not cats and not sneeze, so only paltry(11, ...) or tightfisted(11, ...) can ever add next 11 X.\n\n- paltry(11, Y, Z) requires vase 11 Y and next Y Z. The only Y that can be used in sip(...) to create vase 11 Y is Y = object_0 (the only cats object is object_0). That gives vase 11 0 via sip(11,0,z) (when next11 z and next0 z hold). So paltry could only produce next 11 Z for Z equal to some Z that next0 Z can be made to hold. From the available springs, next0 can be turned into next0 8 via memory(0,5,8) (since spring 5 and spring 8 exist), but there is no way to produce next0 7 (spring 7 does not exist), so paltry(11,0,7) is impossible.\n\n- tightfisted(11, S, T) requires vase 11 S and next S T, and S must be a sneeze object (only S in {3,4}). So to get next 11 7 via tightfisted we would need:\n  - a vase 11 S (S ∈ {3,4}), which can only be created by clip(11,S,Z) or sip(11,S,Z) (sip requires S to be cats — only object_0 is cats, so not possible for S=3 or 4), hence must be clip(11,S,Z). clip(11,S,Z) requires next S Z and next 11 Z to both hold at the same time.\n  - therefore we need some Z with next 11 Z and next S Z simultaneously (to make vase 11 S), and then next S 7 (so tightfisted can add next 11 7).\n  - initially next 11 Z holds only for Z = 8 (next 11 8). So the only initial clip that can make a vase is clip(11,4,8) (sneeze 4 and next 4 8 and next 11 8 hold). That yields vase 11 4, and then tightfisted(11,4,T) can only produce next 11 T for T equal to some target that next 4 T can be made to hold.\n  - next 4 can only be changed by wretched(4, ...). A wretched(4,8,X,oc) can set next 4 X only when collect 8 oc and collect X oc hold for the same oc. From the initial collect facts, the collect sets that share a common oc are:\n    - oc = 1: {5,6,7}\n    - oc = 2: {10,8,9}\n    So from next4 = 8 you can change next4 to some X in {10,8,9} (oc = 2) but not to 7 (7 is in oc=1, while 8 is in oc=2). In other words, there is no oc that makes collect(8,oc) and collect(7,oc) both true in the initial data, so no wretched can turn next4 8 into next4 7. Therefore tightfisted(11,4,7) is impossible.\n\n- The other option, trying to make vase(11,3) and use tightfisted(11,3,7), runs into the same kind of circularity: producing vase(11,3) via clip(11,3,Z) requires next11 Z and next3 Z simultaneously; but there is no available action sequence that creates such a Z while also creating the needed next3 7 in the end, without requiring next11 7 already or a vase for 11 (circular). Straightforward attempts to route through other available actions (memory on object_0, wretched on sneeze objects 3 or 4, sip to get vase with cats=0) all hit these same constraints.\n\nBecause next 11 7 cannot be produced by any allowable sequence, the overall goal set (which requires next 11 7) is unreachable from the given initial state.\n\nIf you want, I can:\n- produce a maximal partial plan that achieves the other reachable goals (next 12 9, next 13 8 already true, next 14 9, next 15 6) and stops where it hits the impossible step, or\n- suggest small changes to initial facts (e.g., add collect 8 1 or add spring 7 or make object_11 also cats or sneeze) that would make the full goal reachable and then give a full plan.

To change the next relation for a hand object (object_14 or object_15) there are only two action patterns that add next for a hand subject: paltry and tightfisted. Both require a vase fact of the form vase handX someY as a precondition. Vase facts can only be created by clip or sip.\n\n- clip(hand, sneezeY, t) requires next(hand, t) and next(sneezeY, t) already hold (and sneezeY must be one of the sneeze objects). So clip can only create vase(hand, sneezeY) when the hand and the chosen sneeze object already share the same current next target t.\n- sip(hand, catsY, t) requires next(hand, t) and next(catsY, t) already hold (and catsY must be a cats object). So sip also requires the hand to already have the desired t (thus is not helpful to change it to a new different t without circularity).\n\nTo get next(object_14,object_9) by tightfisted we need:\n- a vase object_14 X (X must be a sneeze object, because tightfisted's second arg is sneeze),\n- next X object_9 (so the sneeze object currently points to object_9).\n\nThe only sneeze objects are object_4 and object_5. Their initial nexts are:\n- next object_4 object_8\n- next object_5 object_9\n\nSo object_5 already points to object_9 (useful). To create vase object_14 object_5 by clip, clip would require next object_14 t and next object_5 t for some t shared by both. Initially next object_14 = object_8 and next object_5 = object_9 — they are different, so clip cannot create vase object_14 object_5 initially. To make them share a t you would need to change either next object_14 or next object_5 beforehand. But:\n- You cannot set next(object_14, object_9) without already having a vase for object_14 (paltry/tightfisted need a vase), so changing object_14 first is circular.\n- Changing next(object_5, something) is only possible via wretched applied to object_5 (wretched is the only action that changes next for sneeze subjects). wretched(object_5, current, new, o3) requires collect(current, o3) and collect(new, o3) for the same o3. For the specific initial current = object_9 there is no object o3 that satisfies both collect(object_9,o3) and collect(object_8,o3) or whatever would be needed to make object_5 agree with object_14. The collect facts in the problem do not give a common o3 that would allow wretched to change object_5's next to object_8 (or any value matching object_14) in a way that would allow creating vase object_14 object_5. Therefore you cannot make object_5 share the same next target as object_14 so clip cannot produce vase object_14 object_5.\n\nSince sip requires the hand and the cats object to already map to the same target (again circular), there is no way to create the vase needed to use paltry/tightfisted to set object_14 to object_9.\n\nThe same reasoning applies for object_15.\n\nConclusion\n- A partial plan (shown above) can achieve next(object_13,object_6) (and next object_12 object_10 was already true).\n- However, given the initial collect/sneeze mappings, it is impossible to create the vase facts necessary to set next(object_14,object_9) and next(object_15,object_9). Therefore the full goal set {next 12 10, next 13 6, next 14 9, next 15 9, next 16 8} is not achievable from the given initial state with the provided actions.\n\nIf you want, I can:\n- (a) produce the full executable prefix in the exact plan format you used, or\n- (b) try alternative ways (for example, changing some of the collect/spring/stupendous assignments if you permit) that would make the remaining goals reachable.

      "response": "I checked the domain and initial facts against the available actions. Conclusion: there is no valid plan that achieves your goal set from the given initial state. In short, at least one required goal is unreachable, so the whole goal conjunction is unreachable.\n\nReason (concise, structural):\n\n- The textures partition into two disjoint \"collect\" groups (from collect facts):\n  - Group d=1: {5,6,7}\n  - Group d=2: {8,9,10}\n  wretched only moves a sneeze-subject's next between textures inside the same collect group (it requires collect(b,d) and collect(c,d) for the same d). A sneeze object therefore can only ever have its next in one collect group; it can be changed within that group but cannot cross groups.\n\n- Which actions can change next(a,·) for a non-sneeze, non-cats subject a (e.g. hands 11,12,13,16)?\n  - They can get a new next only via paltry/tightfisted (which add next a c) but those require a vase(a,b).\n  - A vase(a,b) is produced by clip or sip. clip(a,b,c) requires next(a,c) and next(b,c) to already hold (it consumes next(a,c) to create the vase). So clip can only be applied for a given a on a c that a already points to. Then paltry/tightfisted can move a from that c to some c' only if the same b has next(b,c') at the time of the paltry/tightfisted.\n  - Therefore to move a from a current texture c_old to a new texture c_new you need some pivot b that simultaneously has next(b,c_old) (to allow creating vase(a,b) via clip) and next(b,c_new) (to allow tightfisted/paltry to add next(a,c_new)). That requires b to have next to textures in the same collect group as c_old and c_new (so c_old and c_new must be in the same collect group).\n\n- Apply this to your goals:\n  - object_12 initially has next(12,7). 7 is in group d=1. The goal asks next(12,8). 8 is in group d=2. To get 12 from a group-1 texture to a group-2 texture would require a pivot b that has next to a texture in both groups simultaneously — not possible under the actions available (wretched/sneeze only move within one collect group at a time, and clip/tightfisted sequences cannot make b simultaneously point to both groups). So next(12,8) is unreachable.\n  - The same reasoning applies to object_13 (initial next(13,7) in group 1 → goal next(13,8) in group 2) and to object_11 (initial next(11,9) in group 2 → goal next(11,5) in group 1). Each of these requires crossing collect groups and so is unreachable.\n  - Since at least one required goal (in fact several) is unreachable, the overall goal conjunction cannot be achieved.\n\nBecause some of the goal facts are provably impossible to reach from the initial facts under the allowed actions, no valid plan exists. If you want, I can:\n\n- produce a formal counterexample / step-by-step impossibility proof for a particular goal (e.g. for object_12),\n- suggest minimal changes to initial facts or to action definitions that would make the goal set reachable,\n- or try to compute a plan that achieves the subset of goals that are actually reachable (e.g. the goals already true or those reachable inside the same collect group).

object_7, next object_14 object_5, next object_15 object_8 and next object_16 object_6.\n\nMy plan is as follows:\n\n[PLAN]",
      "response": "Short answer: I cannot produce a valid plan from the given initial state to meet the goal. Several required goal atoms are unreachable under the provided action preconditions — there are unavoidable circular dependencies. Below I explain why and point out which subgoals are already satisfied and what minimal changes to the initial state would make the remaining subgoals achievable.\n\nWhat is already satisfied\n- next object_12 object_9 is true initially — already meets goal.\n- next object_16 object_6 is true initially — already meets goal.\n\nWhy the remaining subgoals are unreachable\nThe problematic goal atoms are:\n- next object_11 object_5\n- next object_13 object_7\n- next object_14 object_5\n- next object_15 object_8\n\nTo get next X Y (for X in {11,13,14,15}) an action must add next X Y. The only actions that add a next fact with first argument equal to X are: paltry(X,·,Y), memory(X,·,Y), wretched(X,·,Y,·), or tightfisted(X,·,Y). Of those:\n\n- memory requires cats X (X must be in cats). cats is true only for object_0, so memory cannot be used for X = 11,13,14,15.\n- wretched requires sneeze X. sneeze holds only for objects 3 and 4, so wretched cannot be used for X = 11,13,14,15.\n\nThat leaves paltry and tightfisted. Their preconditions (shared parts) require:\n- hand X (we do have hand for 11,13,14,15),\n- a vase fact vase X B (paltry requires vase X B and cats B; tightfisted requires vase X B and sneeze B and next B Y),\nand both paltry and tightfisted delete the old next X Z when they add next X Y. So to apply paltry/tightfisted for X you must first have vase X B (for some B).\n\nHow can vase X B be created? Only sip or clip create vase X B.\n- sip(X,B,C) requires cats B (so B must be object_0 because only cats object_0 is true) and also requires next X C and next B C. Thus sip to make any vase for X requires next X C already — i.e. it needs the very next(X,·) you are trying to create (or some other next for X), creating a circular dependency.\n- clip(X,B,C) requires sneeze B (B must be 3 or 4) and also requires next X C as a precondition. So clip also requires an existing next X C to create a vase for X.\n\nTherefore, for any X in {11,13,14,15}, producing vase X B by sip/clip requires next X something to already be present. But paltry/tightfisted (the only actions that could add the new next for X) require the vase X B to be present beforehand. This is a cycle with no base case in the initial state: there is no way to create the needed vase X B without already having a next for X, and there is no way to create the next for X without the vase. Hence next object_11 object_5, next object_13 object_7, next object_14 object_5, and next object_15 object_8 are unreachable from the given initial facts.\n\nConcrete example of the circularity (for object_11 -> object_5)\n- Desired: create next 11 5.\n- Actions that add next 11 5 would be paltry(11, B, 5) or tightfisted(11, B, 5).\n- Both require vase 11 B.\n- The only actions that can make vase 11 B are sip(11,B,C) or clip(11,B,C).\n- Both sip and clip require next 11 C as a precondition. That precondition is exactly a next with subject 11 that we do not have yet.\nSo you cannot bootstrap next 11 5 — it is unreachable.\n\nWhat you can do (suggestions)\nTo make the overall goal reachable you must break the circular dependencies. Several minimal ways to do that (add a fact or change initial state) are:\n\n- Add vase facts directly for the required hands, e.g. add vase object_11 object_0, vase object_13 object_0, vase object_14 object_0, vase object_15 object_0. With these vines present, paltry/tightfisted can be applied (given the other preconditions), allowing the next facts to be changed.\nOR\n- Give some of the target X objects the sneeze property (sneeze object_11 etc.), and provide the needed next X C some other way so clip can be used; but this tends to reintroduce circular needs unless you also seed at least one next X C.\nOR\n- Seed at least one next X C for each X (for example add next object_11 object_8 or next object_11 object_5 directly); from there you can create vase X B via sip/clip and then change the next to the desired target. (But adding next facts directly is the simplest way to break the cycle.)\nOR\n- Give cats to more objects (so sip could create a vase with second argument other than object_0) — but sip still needs an existing next X C, so this alone will not solve the cycle.\n\nIf you want, I can:\n- produce a corrected initial state with the minimal added facts to make the goal reachable, and then synthesize a valid plan; or\n- attempt to find a plan under a specific modification you prefer (for example \"allow adding vase object_11 object_0 initially\" or \"make object_11 sneeze\"), then produce the step-by-step actions.\n\nWhich would you like me to do?",

      "response": "Summary — two problem instances:\n\n1) First instance (you gave a 4-step plan): I checked it — the plan is valid and reaches the goal.\nWalkthrough (state changes only for relevant facts):\n- Initial: next(0,6), next(1,6), next(4,6), next(5,7), next(8,7), next(9,7), ... texture(6,7), hand(8,9), cats(0,1), spring(6,7), stupendous(2,3), collect(6,2), collect(7,3), sneeze(4,5).\nPlan:\n  1) memory object_1 object_6 object_7\n     - Preconditions satisfied (cats(1), spring(6), spring(7), next(1,6)).\n     - Effects: add next(1,7); delete next(1,6).\n  2) sip object_9 object_1 object_7\n     - Preconditions satisfied (hand(9), cats(1), texture(7), next(9,7), next(1,7)).\n     - Effects: add vase(9,1); delete next(9,7).\n  3) memory object_1 object_7 object_6\n     - Preconditions satisfied (cats(1), spring(7), spring(6), next(1,7)).\n     - Effects: add next(1,6); delete next(1,7).\n  4) paltry object_9 object_1 object_6\n     - Preconditions satisfied (hand(9), cats(1), texture(6), vase(9,1), next(1,6)).\n     - Effects: add next(9,6); delete vase(9,1).\n\nResult: next(9,6) is added and next(8,7) from the initial state was never deleted. So both goal facts (next object_8 object_7 and next object_9 object_6) hold. Plan succeeds.\n\n2) Second instance (you gave initial facts and goal next object_9 object_8, but no plan): I analyzed reachability and conclude the goal is unreachable from the given initial state (no valid plan) under the provided action schema. Reasoning sketch:\n\n- Which actions can add a next(A,B) fact? paltry, memory, wretched, tightfisted (each adds next object_0 object_2 with their parameters).\n- To get next(9,8) we must apply one of these with object_0 = 9 and object_2 = 8.\n\nCheck each possibility:\n- memory(9, X, 8) requires cats(9). cats only holds for object_0 in your initial facts, not object_9 — cats(9) is false, and no action creates cats, so memory is impossible for object_0=9.\n- wretched(9, X, 8, Y) requires sneeze(9). sneeze only holds for objects 3 and 4 initially; nothing creates sneeze(9), so wretched with object_0=9 is impossible.\n- tightfisted(9, X, 8) requires vase(9,X) and sneeze(X) and next(X,8). Getting vase(9,X) must be done by sip or clip:\n  - sip(9,X,8) requires cats(X) (we only have cats(0)), so making a vase via sip is impossible for any X ≠ 0.\n  - clip(9,X,8) requires next(9,8) already (circular) as well as next(X,8); so clip can't bootstrap vase(9,X) without the goal already present.\n  So vase(9,X) cannot be created in a non-circular way, so tightfisted cannot be applied to produce next(9,8).\n- paltry(9, X, 8) requires vase(9,X) and cats(X) and next(X,8). As above, vase(9,X) cannot be created without circular requirements, and cats(X) only holds for object_0, which doesn't help because you still need vase(9,0) or next(0,8) (which you don't have).\n\nThere is one useful non-circular move: wretched(4,7,8,2) is applicable in the initial state and would add next(4,8) (I checked all its preconditions are met: sneeze(4), texture(7), texture(8), stupendous(2), next(4,7) and collect(7,2), collect(8,2)). So you can create next(4,8). But once you have next(4,8), there is still no non-circular way to convert that into next(9,8) because every applicable action that would create next(9,8) requires either cats(9), sneeze(9), or a vase(9,*) — none of which can be produced without already having next(9,8) or without adding new initial facts. Thus the goal next(9,8) is unreachable from the given initial facts.\n\nSuggested minimal changes to make the goal reachable\n- Add sneeze object_9 to the initial facts. Then wretched(9,7,8,2) becomes applicable (sneeze(9), texture(7), texture(8), stupendous(2), next(9,7) present, collect(7,2) and collect(8,2) present) and will directly add next(9,8). So adding sneeze(9) is a small fix.\n- Alternatively, add cats object_9 and spring object_8. Then memory(9,7,8) would be applicable (cats(9), spring(7), spring(8), next(9,7)) and would add next(9,8).\n- Alternatively, allow cats(4) (or cats of some X with vase creation route) and create vase(9,X) via sip — but this tends to be larger changes.\n\nIf you want, I can:\n- produce a corrected plan for the second instance after you tell me which (if any) initial facts you are willing to add/change (for example: add sneeze object_9), or\n- produce a plan that achieves some intermediate fact like next(4,8) (e.g., the wretched(4,7,8,2) step) if that is useful.\n\nWhich would you like me to do next?",

Both require a vase fact vase object_10 b.\n  - paltry additionally requires b to be a cats object and next b object_6 to already hold.\n  - tightfisted additionally requires b to be a sneeze object and next b object_6 to already hold.\n\n- Can we produce vase object_10 b?\n  - Only operators that produce vase are sip(a,b,c) and clip(a,b,c). Both require next a c and next b c for the same c (they need a common successor c).\n  - Initially next object_10 object_9 is true; next object_1 object_6 is true (the only cats are object_0 and object_1).

But:\n    - You cannot change next object_10 · with memory or wretched because those require object_10 to be cats or sneeze (it is not).\n    - paltry/tightfisted could change next object_10 · but they require vase object_10 b first — circular dependency.\n    - You could change next object_1 · with memory, but memory requires spring on the new successor; the only springs are objects 6 and 8, so you can change next object_1 6 → next object_1 8 (memory 1 6 8), but that still does not match next object_10 9. There is no way to make next object_1 9 because spring object_9 is false and no operator can create spring facts.\n\n- Similarly, trying to use tightfisted with a sneeze b (object_4 or object_5) runs into the need for next b object_6 (e.g., next object_5 object_6), which cannot be produced because object_5 is not cats (so memory cannot apply) and wretched cannot produce the required mapping given the available collect facts (the needed collect facts to satisfy wretched for b=9 vs c=6 don't match).\n\nBecause every route to add next object_10 object_6 runs into an unmet precondition that cannot be produced from the initial facts (circular dependency or missing required predicates like cats/sneeze/spring), the goal is unreachable with the given operators and initial state.\n\nIf you want, I can:\n- show this as a short formal search proof (e.g., explore reachable predicates up to a depth),\n- or try an alternative goal or allow adding/changing initial facts (e.g., make object_10 also cats or add spring/sneeze facts) and then generate a plan.
