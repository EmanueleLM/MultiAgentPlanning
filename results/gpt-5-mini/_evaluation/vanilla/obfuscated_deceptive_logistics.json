Below I give a correct plan that achieves the two reachable goals and then a short proof why next(object_9,object_6) cannot be achieved.\n\nPlan (achieves next object_10 object_8 and next object_11 object_7)\n1. sip object_11 object_0 object_5\n2. sip object_10 object_0 object_5\n3. memory object_0 object_5 object_7\n4. paltry object_11 object_0 object_7\n5. paltry object_10 object_0 object_7\n6. clip object_10 object_4 object_7\n7. wretched object_4 object_7 object_8 object_2\n8. tightfisted object_10 object_4 object_8\n\nBrief checks:\n- Steps 1–3: create vase(object_11,object_0) and vase(object_10,object_0) and make next(object_0,object_7) (memory uses next(object_0,object_5) which is still present before step 3).\n- Steps 4–5 (paltry): use those vases and next(object_0,object_7) to create next(object_11,object_7) and next(object_10,object_7).\n- Step 6 (clip 10 4 7) needs next(object_4,object_7) and next(object_10,object_7) — both hold — and produces vase(object_10,object_4).\n- Step 7 (wretched 4 7 8 2) turns next(object_4,object_7) into next(object_4,object_8).\n- Step 8 (tightfisted 10 4 8) requires vase(object_10,object_4), sneeze(object_4), texture(object_8) and next(object_4,object_8) — all satisfied — and produces next(object_10,object_8).\n\nWhy next(object_9,object_6) is unreachable\n- Which actions can add a fact next(9, X)?\n  - paltry adds next(h, o2) but paltry requires cats(object_1) on the second argument. In the initial state the only cats fact is cats object_0, so paltry(9, *, *) can only have its second parameter = object_0. That means paltry can only add next(9, Y) where Y is whatever object_0 currently points to (initially 5; with memory it can become 7). So paltry can produce next(9,5) or next(9,7) at best — never next(9,6).\n  - tightfisted adds next(h, o2) but requires a vase(h, o1) where o1 is a sneeze object and an existing next(o1, o2). To get next(9,6) via tightfisted you would need a vase(9, s) with s a sneeze object that has next(s,6). The only sneeze object that has next(.,6) initially is object_3 (next(object_3,object_6)). So you would need vase(9,object_3).\n- How to get vase(9,object_3)?\n  - sip creates vase(h, object_0) only (the second arg must be the cats object_0), so sip cannot create vase(9,3).\n  - clip can create a vase(h, o1) where o1 is a sneeze object, but clip(h,o1,o2) requires both next(o1,o2) and next(h,o2) to exist already. To create vase(9,3) via clip you would need a p such that next(3,p) and next(9,p) are both present. That requires next(9,p) to exist before you can create the vase you need to create next(9,6) — circular.\n- Therefore there is no non-circular way to produce the needed vase(9,3) and thus no way to apply tightfisted to get next(9,6). Paltry cannot produce it either (paltry's second arg is restricted to object_0). No other action produces next facts with first argument 9. Conclusion: next(object_9,object_6) is unreachable.\n\nIf you want, I can:\n- produce a minimal plan just for the two reachable goals (the one above is already quite compact), or\n- run through a fuller forward-simulation trace (state after each action), or\n- search again if you add any additional initial facts (e.g., additional cats or sneeze facts or a collect to permit a different wretched mapping) that might make next(object_9,object_6) possible.",

      "response": "I examined the available actions, the second instance's initial facts, and the goal (next object_10 object_7, next object_11 object_9, next object_12 object_8). I could not find any valid action sequence that achieves the goal from the given initial conditions. Below is a concise, focused explanation of why the goal is unreachable as stated.\n\nKey facts about how next facts can be produced\n- Actions that can add \"next X Y\" are: paltry, wretched, memory, and tightfisted.\n  - memory requires the first argument to be a cats object (only object_0 or object_1 here).\n  - wretched requires the first argument to be a sneeze object (only object_4 or object_5 here).\n  - paltry and tightfisted require the first argument to be a hand object (object_10,11,12), so those are the only actions that could add next for the three goal subjects 10, 11, 12.\n- paltry(o0,o1,o2) preconditions: hand o0, cats o1, texture o2, vase(o0,o1), next(o1,o2). So paltry can only be used when the second argument is a cats object (object_0 or object_1).\n- tightfisted(o0,o1,o2) preconditions: hand o0, sneeze o1, texture o2, next(o1,o2), vase(o0,o1). So tightfisted needs (a) a vase linking the hand to a sneeze object and (b) that sneeze object must already have the desired next target.\n\nWhy next object_10 object_7 cannot be produced\n- To produce next(10,7) the only applicable adders are paltry and tightfisted (memory and wretched cannot use 10 as first arg).\n- paltry(10, c, 7) would require c to be a cats object (so c must be object_0 or object_1) and next(c,7) to already exist. Initial next facts do not include next(0,7) or next(1,7). The only way to change next(1,·) is memory(1,·,·), but memory can only generate next(1,6) from the given springs (it can turn next(1,8) into next(1,6) — not next(1,7)). So paltry cannot create next(10,7) here.\n- tightfisted(10, s, 7) would require s to be a sneeze object (s ∈ {4,5}), next(s,7) to already hold, and vase(10,s) to exist. next(4,7) does hold initially (so s = 4 is promising), so the remaining obstacle is vase(10,4).\n- To create vase(10,4) you need either clip or sip (both require that 10 and 4 already share the same next target). For clip(10,4,t) or sip(10,4,t) to work you need next(10,t) and next(4,t) both already true for some t. Initial next(10,9) is true, so we would need next(4,9). But there is no way to produce next(4,9) from the available actions and initial collects/springs: wretched could change next(4,·), but given the collect targets available, you can only change next(4,7) into next(4,6) (because collect(6,2) and collect(7,2) share the same collect target), not into next(4,9). memory cannot change 4 because memory needs cats as first arg. Thus next(4,9) cannot be produced, hence vase(10,4) cannot be produced, hence tightfisted(10,4,7) cannot be applied.\n- Therefore neither paltry nor tightfisted can produce next(10,7) under the given initial facts. That alone suffices to show the overall goal is unreachable.\n\nAnalogous obstacles for the other goals\n- next(11,9): same reasoning — 11 is a hand object, so only paltry or tightfisted could add next(11,9). paltry would need a cats second arg with next(cat,9) already true; memory can’t produce next(cat,9) with the available springs. tightfisted would need a vase(11,s) with s a sneeze object and next(s,9) true. Creating vase(11,s) again needs shared next targets, which we cannot engineer for the available sneeze objects given the collect/spring constraints. The needed shared-next targets are not producible.\n- next(12,8): similar constraints — 12 is a hand object and to add next(12,8) we would need paltry or tightfisted. paltry would need next(cat,8) for a cats cat (initial next(1,8) does exist; so paltry(12,1,8) would also require vase(12,1) — but vase(12,1) cannot be created without already having a matching next for some object, leading again to the same circular obstacle). tightfisted(12,s,8) would require a vase(12,s) and next(s,8); next(5,8) initially holds (s = 5 is possible), but creating vase(12,5) runs into the same circular requirement (it requires a shared next target neither producible given the collect pairs available).\n\nConclusion\nBecause producing any of next(10,7), next(11,9), next(12,8) requires forming certain vase facts (or specific next facts) that themselves would require the very next facts we’re trying to make (or require next facts that cannot be produced given the collect/spring constraints), the goal triple is unreachable from the given initial state with the available actions.\n\nIf you want, I can:\n- attempt an automated search (bounded depth) to confirm unreachable up to some bound,\n- propose minimal changes to the initial state that would make the goal reachable (for example: add a sneeze fact for one of object_10/11/12, or add a vase fact, or add a collect that creates a matching collect pair), or\n- try to construct a plan if you allow adding or changing one initial predicate.\n\nWhich would you prefer?",

      "response": "I analyzed the actions, initial facts, and your goal set. Conclusion: the full goal set (next object_10 object_8, next object_11 object_6, next object_12 object_8, next object_9 object_5) is not achievable from the given initial state with the provided actions. One of the required goal facts (next object_11 object_6) is unreachable; because of that, no plan can reach the whole goal set.\n\nWhy next object_11 object_6 is unreachable (concise formal reasoning)\n\n- Which actions can add next(X, Z) for a non-sneeze object X?\n  - paltry(X, Y, Z) adds next(X, Z) but requires cats(Y) (so Y must be object_0) and next(object_0, Z).\n  - tightfisted(X, Y, Z) adds next(X, Z) but requires vase(X, Y) and sneeze(Y) and next(Y, Z).\n  - memory adds next only for the cats object (object_0).\n  - wretched adds next only for the sneeze parameter a (i.e., it can only change next for a sneeze object).\n\n- To get next(object_11, object_6) there are only two possible routes:\n  1) paltry(object_11, object_0, object_6) — requires next(object_0, object_6).\n     - memory is the only action that can change next(object_0, ·). memory(object_0, q, r) requires q and r to be springs. The given springs are object_5 and object_7, so memory can only set next(object_0, object_5) or next(object_0, object_7). object_6 is not a spring, so next(object_0, object_6) can never be produced. So paltry cannot produce next(object_11, object_6).\n  2) tightfisted(object_11, Y, object_6) — requires sneeze(Y) and next(Y, object_6) and vase(object_11, Y).\n     - The only sneeze objects are object_3 and object_4. object_3 initially has next(object_3, object_6) (so it is a candidate).\n     - But to get vase(object_11, object_3) we must create it via clip or sip:\n       - sip requires cats(Y) (so Y would need to be object_3 as cats, but object_3 is not cats), so sip won't make vase(..., object_3).\n       - clip(object_11, object_3, z) needs next(object_11, z) and next(object_3, z) already true. For z = object_6, clip would require next(object_11, object_6) to already be true. That is circular: creating vase(object_11, object_3) by clip requires the very next(object_11, object_6) we want to obtain. So we cannot create vase(object_11, object_3) without already having next(object_11, object_6).\n     - Therefore tightfisted cannot be applied to produce next(object_11, object_6) unless next(object_11, object_6) already existed.\n\nBecause both routes are impossible from the initial facts, next(object_11, object_6) is unreachable, so the overall goal set cannot be achieved.\n\nNotes about the other goals\n- Some goals in the set are reachable in isolation or jointly (for example I sketched a viable sequence earlier to produce next(object_12, object_8) and next(object_10, object_8) by using clip → change a sneeze object's next → tightfisted). But since one goal is provably impossible, there is no plan that reaches all four simultaneously.\n\nIf you want, I can:\n- produce a maximal partial plan that reaches all reachable subset goals (e.g., achieve object_10/object_12 to 8, etc.), or\n- show a minimal modification to the problem that would make next(object_11, object_6) reachable (for example: add next(object_0, object_6) to the initial facts, or add a collect relation that lets a sneeze object be transformed to have next(...,6), or mark object_3 as also a hand so sip could build the vase), and then produce a complete plan under that modified instance.\n\nWhich would you prefer?",

      "response": "Short answer: there is no valid plan that achieves the second goal set from the given initial facts. One of the required goal facts (next object_12 object_7) is unreachable under the action preconditions/effects, so the whole goal conjunction is unreachable.\n\nReasoning (sketch, focused on the blocking point)\n- Which actions can add a next A B fact?\n  - memory adds next o0 o2 (pre: cats o0, spring o1, spring o2, next o0 o1)\n  - wretched adds next o0 o2 (pre: sneeze o0, texture o1, texture o2, stupendous o3, next o0 o1, collect o1 o3, collect o2 o3)\n  - paltry adds next o0 o2 (pre: hand o0, cats o1, texture o2, vase o0 o1, next o1 o2)\n  - tightfisted adds next o0 o2 (pre: hand o0, sneeze o1, texture o2, next o1 o2, vase o0 o1)\n  (clip and sip do not directly add next; they create/delete vase and/or delete a next)\n\n- Consider the specific required fact next object_12 object_7.\n  - object_12 is a hand object (hand object_12). memory cannot be used because memory requires cats o0; object_12 is not a cat.\n  - wretched cannot be used with o0 = object_12 because wretched requires sneeze o0, and sneeze is true only for object_4 and object_5 in the initial state.\n  - So the only action that could create next object_12 object_7 is tightfisted with o0 = object_12 and o2 = object_7:\n    tightfisted object_12 X object_7\n    Preconditions: hand object_12 (true), sneeze X (so X must be object_4 or object_5), texture object_7 (true), next X object_7, and vase object_12 X.\n    So to get next object_12 object_7 we would need (a) some sneeze object X that currently has next X 7, and (b) a vase object_12 X.\n\n  - Which sneeze objects exist initially? object_4 and object_5.\n    - next object_4 object_7 is true initially (object_4 → 7).\n    - next object_5 object_7 is not true initially (object_5 → 9).\n    - So X would have to be object_4 (because only object_4 initially provides next X 7).\n    - Therefore we need vase object_12 object_4 and next object_4 object_7 to hold simultaneously at some point.\n\n  - Can we create vase object_12 object_4?\n    - The only way to create a vase with a hand as first arg is clip or sip. sip would require cats object_4 (false), so only clip can create vase object_12 object_4.\n    - clip object_12 object_4 Y requires next object_12 Y and next object_4 Y (same Y) at clip time.\n    - So to make vase object_12 object_4 we must find some Y for which both next object_12 Y and next object_4 Y hold simultaneously.\n\n  - What successors can object_4 and object_12 have?\n    - Initially object_4 → 7.\n    - By wretched, object_4 can change successor from 7 to 6 (wretched 4 7 6 2 is allowed because collect 7 2 and collect 6 2 both hold and stupendous 2 holds). That gives object_4 → 6. There is no allowed wretched or other action that makes object_4 → 9 (the collects do not permit 4 to switch to 9).\n    - So object_4's reachable successors are 7 (initial) and 6 (via wretched).\n    - object_12's initial successor is 9. Can we change object_12's successor to 6 or 7 so it would match object_4's at some time and allow a clip to create vase 12 4?\n      - To change object_12's successor we would need paltry, tightfisted or memory/wretched with o0 = object_12, but we already saw memory and wretched are not applicable to object_12 (memory requires cats, wretched requires sneeze). So only paltry or tightfisted could change object_12's successor — both require a vase object_12 * to exist already. That brings us back to needing vase object_12 X in the first place (circular).\n    - Conclusion: there is no non-circular way to make next object_12 equal to 6 or 7 so that a clip can be applied to create vase object_12 object_4. Therefore vase object_12 object_4 cannot be created.\n\n  - Since we cannot create vase object_12 object_4, we cannot execute tightfisted object_12 object_4 object_7, hence next object_12 object_7 is unreachable.\n\n- Because next object_12 object_7 is unreachable, the whole goal set {next object_10 object_6, next object_11 object_9, next object_12 object_7, next object_13 object_9} cannot be achieved from the given initial facts and actions.\n\nIf you want me to:\n- try an automated search to either find a plan or produce a formal impossibility proof, I can (but it may take time);\n- or propose a small change to the initial facts (for example add a collect or a spring or make object_12 a cat or give a sneeze fact to object_12) that would make the instance solvable — tell me what kinds of changes you allow and I can present a valid plan.\n\nAlso, if you intended me to check the first instance / its long plan for correctness, say so and I will verify it step by step.",

Effects: next(12,7) added (goal next 12 7 satisfied), vase(12,4) deleted.\n\nnext(13,9) was already present in the initial state and was never deleted. Final state therefore contains next(10,6), next(11,8), next(12,7), next(13,9). Conclusion: the provided plan is valid and achieves the goal.\n\n2) Second instance (initial facts given; goal: next object_11 object_10)\n\nI looked for a plan and also checked whether creating next(11,10) is possible given the available actions and initial facts. Actions that can create a next(a,b) fact in their add-effects are: paltry, memory, wretched and tightfisted. To get next(11,10) one of the following must be true in an applicable action:\n\n- memory(11, x, 10) — requires cats(11) and spring(10). cats(11) is not in the initial facts and no action can add cats, spring(10) is not present and no action can add springs → not possible.\n- wretched(11, x, 10, k) — requires sneeze(11) (not present) → not possible.\n- paltry(11, x, 10) — requires hand(11) (we have), cats(x) but cats exist only for object_0 in your initial facts so x would have to be object_0; it also requires next(object_0,10) and vase(11,object_0). Next(0,10) is not present and there is no way to produce next(0,10) given your actions (memory would need spring(10), wretched would need sneeze(0) or appropriate collect facts which are absent). Likewise vase(11,0) can only be produced by clip/sip, but those require next(11,10) already (circular). So paltry cannot practically produce next(11,10).\n- tightfisted(11, x, 10) — requires sneeze(x) (only 3 or 4 are sneeze), next(x,10) and vase(11,x). You can make next(4,10) (see below) but vase(11,4) would have to be produced by clip/sip which require next(11,10) already — again circular.\n\nI note one productive action you can do: wretched(4,8,10,2) is applicable (sneeze 4, textures 8 & 10 present, stupendous 2, next 4 8 is true, collect 8 2 and collect 10 2 are both true). That produces next(4,10). But even after next(4,10) exists, to convert that into next(11,10) you need vase(11,4) so you can run tightfisted(11,4,10) or paltry-like variants — yet vase(11,4) can only be created by clip/sip and those require next(11,10) to already exist (circular dependency).\n\nBecause:\n- cats facts are fixed and only cats(object_0) exists (so memory/paltry with other cats are blocked),\n- sneeze(11) is absent (so wretched with o0=11 is blocked),\n- and vase(s) that would unlock tightfisted/paltry cannot be created without the target next(11,10) already present (circular),\nI conclude there is no feasible sequence of the provided actions that will produce next(11,10) from the second initial state. In short: the goal is unreachable under the given action definitions and initial facts.\n\nIf you want I can:\n- produce the short reachable subplan that creates next(4,10) (wretched 4 8 10 2) so you can see the partial progress, or\n- run an explicit forward search (bounded-depth) to try to find any plan if you want me to be exhaustive up to some depth, or\n- modify the goal or allow adding one extra initial fact (e.g., cats(11) or sneeze(11) or spring(10) or an initial vase) and then synthesize a concrete plan.\n\nWhich would you like next?",

      "response": "Short answer: With the given initial facts and action definitions, the goals next object_11 object_7 and next object_12 object_5 are not reachable. The plan space as given cannot produce the required next facts. Below I show why (concise, stepwise), and then I list small changes that would make the goals reachable and an example plan in that case.\n\nWhy the goals are unreachable\n\n1) How next facts with subject 11 or 12 can be produced\n- The only actions that add a next X Y where X is the subject are: paltry (adds next o0 o2), tightfisted (adds next o0 o2), memory (adds next o0 o2), and wretched (adds next o0 o2).\n- memory requires cats o0, and cats exists only for object_0 in the initial facts — so memory can only ever add next for object_0, not for object_11 or object_12.\n- wretched requires sneeze o0, and sneeze facts exist only for object_3 and object_4 — so wretched can only ever add next for object_3 or object_4, not for object_11 or object_12.\n- Therefore the only available ways to add next object_11 ... or next object_12 ... are paltry or tightfisted.\n\n2) Both paltry and tightfisted require a vase fact for the same subject\n- paltry preconditions include vase o0 o1 (and deletes it when executed).\n- tightfisted preconditions include vase o0 o1 (and deletes it when executed).\n- So to get next object_11 Y or next object_12 Y we must first obtain a vase fact vase 11 Z or vase 12 Z.\n\n3) How vase facts can be created\n- Vase facts are produced only by sip or clip.\n- sip requires cats o1 (the vase second-argument). Since cats is true only for object_0, sip can only produce vase o0 object_0 (i.e. vase <anything> object_0).\n- clip requires sneeze o1 (the vase second-argument). Since sneeze is true only for object_3 and object_4, clip can only produce vase <anything> object_3 or vase <anything> object_4.\n\n4) Attempting to make vase 11 Z or vase 12 Z fails given the specific next facts available\n- To get vase 11 object_0 by sip we would need next object_11 T and next object_0 T for the same T. We have next 11 9 initially, so we would need next 0 9. But next 0 9 is not present and cannot be produced: memory could change next 0 but requires spring 9 (not present). wretched cannot produce next 0 because it only works for sneeze subjects (3 or 4). So next 0 9 is unreachable → vase 11 0 via sip is impossible.\n- To get vase 11 object_3 or vase 11 object_4 by clip we would need next 3 T (or next 4 T) and next 11 T for the same T. next 11 9 exists, so we would need next 3 9 or next 4 9. Those are not present and cannot be produced with the available collects/stupendous/springs/textures (attempts to use wretched to set next 3 9 fail because the collect(...) facts do not match a common stupendous object). So vase 11 via clip is also impossible.\n- Analogous reasoning applies for vase 12 Z: sip would require next 0 10 (to match existing next 12 10), but next 0 10 is not present and cannot be produced; clip would require next 3 10 or next 4 10 which are not present and not producible.\n\nConclusion\nBecause a vase 11 Z or vase 12 Z cannot be produced under the current initial facts, neither paltry nor tightfisted can be used to add next object_11 ... or next object_12 ... . Memory and wretched cannot add next facts for 11 or 12 either. Therefore the goals next object_11 object_7 and next object_12 object_5 are unreachable from the given initial state.\n\nWhat would make the goals reachable (suggestions)\n- Add cats object_11 or cats object_12 (so memory could be used for 11/12 if there is an appropriate next and springs), or\n- Add sneeze object_11 or sneeze object_12 (so wretched could directly add next 11 ... or next 12 ...), or\n- Add next object_0 9 and/or next object_0 10 as needed so that sip can create vase 11 0 or vase 12 0, enabling paltry; or\n- Add a collect(...) fact that makes wretched able to generate the required intermediate next facts (e.g., add collect object_9 object_1 so wretched could produce next 3 9), or\n- Add spring object_9 or spring object_10 where memory would be applicable.\n\nExample (if you allow a small helpful fact)\n- If you add next object_0 object_9 (one extra initial fact), then:\n  - sip object_11 object_0 object_9 would be legal (hand 11, cats 0, texture 9, next 11 9, next 0 9) and would create vase 11 0;\n  - paltry object_11 object_0 object_7 would then be legal if texture 7 holds (it does) and next object_0 object_7 exists — if next 0 7 doesn't exist, you might need to first make next 0 7 (e.g. memory or wretched producing it). Adjustments like adding next 0 7 or adding an appropriate spring can finish the plan.\n- If you add next object_0 object_10, then sip object_12 object_0 object_10 followed by paltry object_12 object_0 object_5 would make next 12 5 (because next 0 5 is present initially). Similarly addability of next 11 7 follows analogous fixes.\n\nIf you want, tell me which small additions (e.g., add a specific next, sneeze, cats, collect, or spring fact) you are willing to allow and I will produce an explicit valid plan for the modified instance.",

To get next 13 9 one of these must be applied with o0 = object_13.\n- memory requires cats object_13 — there is no cats object_13 in the initial facts and no action creates cats, so memory cannot be used for o0 = object_13.\n- wretched requires sneeze object_13 — there is no sneeze object_13 and no action creates sneeze facts, so wretched with o0 = object_13 is impossible.\n- paltry requires (among other things) vase object_13 object_X and cats object_X. cats only holds for object_0 and object_1 in the initial facts; so paltry could only work if we first produce vase object_13 object_0 or vase object_13 object_1. Vase facts can only be created by clip or sip.\n  - sip to create vase object_13 object_0 would require next object_13 something and next object_0 same-something; available next object_13 is only to object_7 initially, and next object_0 to object_9 initially — the required pairing is not present, and nothing can create the missing next without needing cats or sneeze for object_13 (circular).\n  - clip to create vase object_13 X requires next object_13 Y and next X Y and sneeze X. The only initial next for object_13 is next object_13 object_7, so clip can only make vase object_13 X when there is some X with sneeze X and next X object_7. We can indeed create next object_4 object_7 (via wretched object_4 object_8 object_7 object_2), and then clip object_13 object_4 object_7 would create vase object_13 object_4. But then paltry cannot use object_4 as the middle parameter because paltry requires cats object_4, and object_4 is not a cats object (cats exist only for object_0 and object_1).\n- tightfisted could add next object_13 object_9 if we had vase object_13 object_X, sneeze object_X, texture object_9, and next object_X object_9. For X = object_5 we can create next object_5 object_9 (wretched object_5 object_11 object_9 object_3 is valid), and object_5 does have sneeze. So that would have satisfied the \"sneeze\" and \"next X 9\" parts — the remaining obstacle is to create vase object_13 object_5. But creating vase object_13 object_5 via clip or sip again requires next object_13 something that we do not have (or would require next object_13 = object_9 already), so again we encounter a circular dependency.\n- In short: every route that could produce next object_13 object_9 requires either cats or sneeze on object_13 (neither available), or requires creating a vase fact vase object_13 object_X that in turn requires a next object_13 ... fact we do not have (circular), or requires cats on the middle parameter (cats only exist for object_0 and object_1 and those cases cannot be created in the needed way). Because no action can introduce cats or sneeze for object_13, and because vase creation for object_13 depends on existing next-relations that we cannot establish without already having next object_13 something, there is no valid sequence of actions from the given initial facts that yields next object_13 object_9.\n\nConclusion\n- Achievable: next object_12 object_10 — plan above (3 actions) reaches it.\n- Unachievable: next object_13 object_9 — unreachable from the given initial facts and action definitions (reasons summarized above).\n\nIf you want, I can:\n- produce a step-by-step simulation of the three-step plan for object_12→object_10, or\n- try alternate sequences in case you want to allow adding/removing some initial facts (e.g., if sneeze or cats for other objects can be provided), or\n- search for a longer plan if you think I missed any allowed action sequences (I can run a deeper systematic search).",

      "response": "I tried to find a valid action sequence that achieves next object_11 object_8, next object_12 object_8 and next object_13 object_10 from the second initial state, but there is no feasible plan under the given action schemas. Below is a short, focused argument why the goals cannot be achieved.\n\nKey observations about the schemas (specialized to your problem):\n- Only paltry(...) and tightfisted(...) can add a next fact whose first argument is a hand (i.e. they can create next h t for a hand h).\n- Both paltry and tightfisted require a vase(h, X) to exist before they can add next h t:\n  - paltry(h, c, t) needs vase(h,c) (c must be a cats object).\n  - tightfisted(h, s, t) needs vase(h,s) (s must be a sneeze object).\n- How can a vase(h, ...) be created?\n  - sip(h,c,t) creates vase(h,c) but sip requires next h t to already exist (so sip cannot create a vase for a hand that currently has no next to that t — circular).\n  - clip(h,s,t) creates vase(h,s) but clip requires next h t to already exist as well (so clip also requires a preexisting next for that same hand h).\n\nTherefore any new next for a hand h can only be produced by paltry/tightfisted after a vase(h, ...) exists, and any vase(h, ...) can only be created by an action that itself requires some next(h, t) already present. That means you cannot create a brand‑new next(h, tnew) for a hand h unless you can exploit the existing next(h, told) in a way that does not remove required preconditions for the later steps. In practice this creates unavoidable circularities/conflicts for your requested goals.\n\nConcrete conflict for next object_13 object_10 (illustrative):\n- To get next(13,10) you need paltry(13, c, 10) or tightfisted(13, s, 10).\n  - paltry(13,c,10) would need vase(13,c). The only way to make vase(13,c) is sip(13,c,10), but sip(13,c,10) itself requires next(13,10) already — circular.\n  - tightfisted(13,s,10) needs vase(13,s) and next(s,10). vase(13,s) can be produced by clip(13,s,t) but clip(13,s,t) needs next(13,t) already and next(s,t). For t=9 you could use the existing next(13,9), but then you need next(s,9) (which can be created by wretched(s, ..., 9, ...) in some cases). However the wretched that makes next(s,9) typically deletes the previously existing next(s,10) (because wretched changes the sneeze's next from one texture to another). tightfisted needs next(s,10) to hold. So making the vase by first changing the sneeze to point at 9 destroys the next(s,10) tightfisted would need — unavoidable in the available options. Thus there is no order that produces vase(13,s) while preserving the required next(s,10).\n\nA similar dependency/circularity blocks producing next(11,8) and next(12,8) as well: paltry requires a vase with a cats object (vase(h, cats)), and that vase can only be made by sip, but sip itself requires the desired next(h, t) to already exist; tightfisted requires a vase(h, sneeze) which requires a clip that in turn requires a matching next(h, t) already. Attempts to change a sneeze's next using wretched to satisfy a clip precondition invariably remove some other next that tightfisted would need.\n\nBecause of these inherent circular dependencies there is no valid sequence of the given actions that produces all three required goal next facts from the given initial facts.\n\nIf you want, I can:\n- (a) try again to find a plan if you allow adding or changing one initial fact (for example add next object_4 object_9 or add a different collect/stupendous that makes a needed wretched possible without deleting needed nexts),\n- (b) search for a plan that achieves a subset of the goals (tell me which subset you prefer), or\n- (c) produce a minimal change set to the initial state that would make your original goals achievable.

      "response": "I examined the domain, the initial facts in your second [STATEMENT], and the action schemas. Conclusion: there is no valid plan that achieves the goal (next object_11 object_5, next object_12 object_9, next object_13 object_10) from the given initial state. I’ll summarize why each required target next(...) is unattainable given the preconditions/effects.\n\nHigh-level observation\n- For an object X that is not sneeze and not cats (here X ∈ {11,12,13} are hands), the only actions that can create a new next X Y (i.e. add next X Y when it did not already exist) are:\n  - tightfisted (adds next a c), or\n  - paltry / memory (but paltry needs cats on the second arg, memory needs cats on the subject — cats only holds for object_0 here), or\n  - wretched (only if the subject a has sneeze — 11/12/13 are not sneeze).\n- So for 11,12,13 the only realistic way to add the needed next facts is tightfisted (since paltry/memory/wretched are not applicable for them given the available cats/sneeze facts). tightfisted(a,b,c) requires:\n  - hand a (true for 11/12/13),\n  - sneeze b (so b must be 3 or 4),\n  - texture c (textures are available for c = 5,6,7,8,9,10),\n  - next b c (i.e. b must already have an outgoing next to c),\n  - and crucially vase a b.\n\nThus the bottleneck for each required next is the existence of a matching vase a b. A vase a b can only be produced by clip or sip (both add vase a b), but both clip and sip require next a c as a precondition (they require next a c and next b c). That means to create vase a b you already need some next a c in place. That creates tight circular dependencies which, in this instance, cannot be broken because of the available collect/stupendous groupings.\n\nDetailed impossibility reasoning (short):\n\n1) next object_12 object_9\n- To add next 12 9 we must use tightfisted 12 b 9 with b in {3,4} (only sneeze objects).\n- Option b = 4: next 4 9 exists initially (good), but tightfisted also needs vase 12 4.\n  - To create vase 12 4 you must use clip/sip which require an existing next 12 c (the only initial next for 12 is next 12 7). So you would need next 4 7 to hold as well (to satisfy next b c). But next 4 7 cannot be produced: wretched(4,9,7,d) would require collect(9,d) and collect(7,d) with the same d. collect facts show collect(...,d) split into two groups: d=1 collects {5,6,7}, d=2 collects {8,9,10}. 9 ∈ d=2 group and 7 ∈ d=1 group, so there is no single d making collect(9,d) and collect(7,d) both true; wretched cannot produce next 4 7. memory/paltry do not apply (4 is not cats). So vase 12 4 cannot be produced.\n- Option b = 3: would require next 3 9. Starting next 3 6, wretched(3,6,9,d) would require collect(6,d) and collect(9,d) with the same d — but 6 ∈ d=1 group and 9 ∈ d=2 group, so impossible. So next 3 9 cannot be produced.\n- Therefore tightfisted for 12 to get next 12 9 cannot be satisfied; next 12 9 is unreachable.\n\n2) next object_13 object_10\n- Same shape of argument as for 12->9. tightfisted 13 b 10 requires a vase 13 b where b ∈ {3,4}, and next b 10.\n- b = 4 path would need vase 13 4; to make that via clip/sip you need next 4 c where c is the current next of 13 (7), so next 4 7 is required — again impossible for the same collect mismatch.\n- b = 3 path needs next 3 10; starting from next 3 6, wretched(3,6,10,d) would require collect(6,d) and collect(10,d) with same d — they are in different collect groups (6 in d=1, 10 in d=2), so impossible.\n- So next 13 10 is unreachable.\n\n3) next object_11 object_5\n- Same pattern. To add next 11 5 we can use tightfisted 11 b 5 (b ∈ {3,4}) requiring vase 11 b and next b 5.\n- b = 3: next 3 5 could be produced (wretched 3 6 5 1 is valid — 6 and 5 are both in d=1 group), so next 3 5 is achievable. But tightfisted 11 3 5 also requires vase 11 3.\n  - To create vase 11 3 via clip/sip you need an existing next 11 c. 11 initially has next 11 10, so c could be 10 — clip 11 3 10 requires next 3 10, which we argued is impossible (see above). So vase 11 3 is not producible.\n- b = 4: next 4 5 is not producible because 4's existing next is 9, and wretched(4,9,5,d) would require both collect(9,d) and collect(5,d) for the same d, but 9 ∈ d=2 and 5 ∈ d=1 so impossible.\n- paltry/memory are not applicable for 11→5 (paltry requires cats on the second arg, cats only holds for object_0; memory requires cats on the subject).\n- Thus next 11 5 cannot be produced either.\n\nOverall conclusion\n- Because each required next for 11,12,13 ultimately needs a vase a b as a prerequisite (and creating those vases is blocked by circular precondition dependencies and the partitioning of collect(...,d) facts into incompatible groups), the three goal next facts cannot be achieved from the given initial state and action definitions. Therefore there is no valid plan.\n\nIf you want, I can:\n- produce a short counterexample trace showing the exact required precondition that fails for each attempted step, or\n- try alternate goals or a relaxed domain (e.g., add a collect fact or make some object also a sneeze or cats) and produce a working plan under the changed assumptions.

      "response": "Short answer: impossible. From the given initial facts & action definitions you cannot achieve the goal triple (next 12 6, next 13 10, next 14 11). I’ll explain the decisive obstruction and then give a minimal change that would make at least next 12 6 achievable and a short example plan under that change.\n\nWhy it is impossible (decisive obstruction)\n- To create any new next(X, Y) with X = object_12 (i.e. to get next object_12 object_6) the only actions that can add a next with h = object_12 are paltry (adds next h t) or tightfisted (adds next h t).\n- Both paltry and tightfisted require a vase relation with h = object_12 (paltry needs vase 12 c, tightfisted needs vase 12 s). So creating any new next for object_12 requires first creating vase object_12 Z for some Z.\n- The only actions that can create a vase for h = object_12 are sip or clip (they are the only ones whose effects include a vase with h as first argument).\n  - sip(12, c, t) requires next 12 t and next c t (same t) and cats c. Currently next 12 11 holds, so sip would require next c 11 for some cats c. The only cats available are object_0 and object_1; neither has next ... 11 in the initial state. So sip cannot produce any vase(12, ·).\n  - clip(12, s, t) requires sneeze s and next s t and next 12 t. With next 12 11, clip would require some sneeze s with next s 11. No such sneeze+next pair exists in the initial facts (the only sneeze objects are object_4 and object_5 and neither has next ... 11). So clip cannot produce any vase(12, ·).\n- Therefore no action can ever produce vase(12, ·) in this instance, hence no action can ever add or move a next fact for object_12 (next 12 11 cannot be replaced by next 12 6). Since next object_12 object_6 is required by the goal, the goal is unreachable.\n\nBecause one required goal literal is unreachable, the whole conjunction (next 12 6, next 13 10, next 14 11) is unreachable.\n\nWhat would make it possible (one minimal fix) and an example plan\n- Minimal useful addition: add next object_1 object_11 to the initial facts.\n  - With that single extra fact, we can do:\n    1) sip object_12 object_1 object_11\n       - pre: hand 12 (yes), cats 1 (yes), texture 11 (yes), next 12 11 (yes), next 1 11 (now true by the extra fact).\n       - effect: creates vase 12 1 and deletes next 12 11.\n    2) paltry object_12 object_1 object_6\n       - pre: hand 12, cats 1, texture 6, vase 12 1 (created in step 1), next 1 6 (initially true).\n       - effect: creates next 12 6 and deletes vase 12 1.\n  - That yields next object_12 object_6. (You would still need to check the remaining two goal literals; similar existence/creation checks are needed for object_13 and object_14 and may require further small additions depending on which route you choose.)\n\nIf you want, I can:\n- (A) Try to find a full concrete action sequence that achieves all three goal next-relations after proposing and applying a small set of additional initial facts (I can propose the minimal extra facts and then produce the full plan), or\n- (B) Analyze reachability individually for next object_13 object_10 and next object_14 object_11 and show what extra facts would be needed to make those achievable.\n\nWhich would you like me to do?",

      "response": "I checked what can be done from your second initial state and found a valid action sequence that achieves three of the four goal next-relations (next 11 9, next 12 8, next 13 5). I also checked whether next 14 7 can be achieved; it cannot be reached under the given operators and initial facts — I give a brief proof below and then the concrete plan for the achievable goals.\n\nWhy next 14 7 appears impossible\n- The only operators that can create next for a hand h are:\n  - paltry(h, 0, b) (needs vase h 0 and next 0 b),\n  - tightfisted(h, s, b) (needs vase h s and next s b).\n- Vase facts for a hand are only produced by:\n  - sip(h, 0, b) which produces vase h 0 (requires next h b and next 0 b),\n  - clip(h, s, b) which produces vase h s (requires next h b and next s b).\n- Thus to end with next 14 7 you must either:\n  - (A) create vase(14,0) and have next(0,7), or\n  - (B) create vase(14,s) where s is a sneeze (3 or 4) and have next(s,7).\n\nNow check each route:\n- Route (A): next(0,7) would have to be produced by memory(0, x, 7). Memory only switches next(0) between spring objects; the only spring objects in the initial state are 5 and 8. So memory can only make next(0) be 5 or 8. So next(0,7) cannot be produced; route (A) impossible.\n- Route (B): s must be 3 or 4. Which sneeze can end up with next(s,7)?\n  - sneeze 3 can be moved among {5,6,7} (these share the same collect stupendous = 1), so 3 can reach 7 — good.\n  - sneeze 4 can only be moved among {8,9,10} (stupendous = 2), so 4 cannot reach 7.\n  - To use tightfisted(14,3,7) we need vase(14,3). vase(14,3) can only be created by clip(14,3,b) for some b where next(14,b) and next(3,b) are both true simultaneously. next(3,b) can be one of {5,6,7}, so b must be in {5,6,7}.

      "response": "I looked for a valid plan from the given initial facts to achieve next object_8 object_7 and next object_9 object_6. next object_8 object_7 is already true in the initial state, so the only nontrivial requirement is to make next object_9 object_6.\n\nI examined every operator that can add a next(...) fact and checked whether it can produce next object_9 object_6:\n\n- Operators that can add next(...) are paltry, wretched, memory and tightfisted.\n  - memory o0 o1 o2 adds next o0 o2 but requires cats o0. To get next 9 6 via memory we would need cats object_9 — cats exist only for object_0 and object_1 in the initial state, so memory cannot produce next 9 6.\n  - wretched o0 o1 o2 o3 adds next o0 o2 but requires sneeze o0. Sneeze objects are object_4 and object_5; object_9 is not a sneeze, so wretched cannot add next 9 6.\n  - That leaves paltry and tightfisted. Both add next o0 o2 (paltry adds next o0 o2; tightfisted adds next o0 o2) and so could add next 9 6 only if their preconditions can be satisfied for o0 = object_9 and o2 = object_6.\n\n- Check paltry/tightfisted possibilities:\n  - paltry 9 J 6 requires: hand 9 (we have), cats J, texture 6 (we have), vase(9,J), and next(J,6). cats(J) limits J to object_0 or object_1 (only these have cats). So to use paltry we need vase(9,0) or vase(9,1) and next(0,6) or next(1,6). next(0,6) and next(1,6) are present initially. So the only missing piece is vase(9,0) or vase(9,1).\n    - How to get vase(9,0) or vase(9,1)? vase(...) can be produced only by sip or clip. Both sip and clip require next(9,K) and next(J,K) for some K (they require next o0 o2 and next o1 o2). If we pick K = object_6 then sip/clip need next(9,6) already (circular: we would need the goal to make the vase). If we pick K = object_7 we would need next(J,7). But neither J=0 nor J=1 has next(...,7) initially (they point to 6), so we would have to create next(0,7) or next(1,7) first. Creating next(0,7) or next(1,7) is possible only by memory (which moves next(0,6) to next(0,7) or next(1,6) to next(1,7)), but memory deletes the original next(.,6) when it creates next(.,7). That would remove the next(J,6) required by paltry. Hence there is no way to produce vase(9,0) or vase(9,1) without destroying the next(J,6) paltry needs — paltry cannot be used to create next 9 6 in a noncircular way.\n\n  - tightfisted 9 J 6 requires: hand 9 (we have), sneeze J, texture 6, next(J,6), and vase(9,J). sneeze J restricts J to object_4 or object_5 (the only sneeze objects). So we need vase(9,4) or vase(9,5) and next(4,6) or next(5,6).\n    - vase(9,5) is producible: clip object_9 object_5 object_7 is applicable initially (hand 9, sneeze 5, texture 7, next 5 7 and next 9 7 are present) and yields vase(9,5). So vase(9,5) is achievable without needing next 9 6.\n    - but tightfisted then still requires next(5,6). Can we create next(5,6)? The only operators that add next(5,6) are again paltry, memory, wretched, tightfisted (with o0=5) — all of which require preconditions that fail:\n      - memory requires cats 5 (false).\n      - paltry requires cats 5 (false).\n      - tightfisted for o0=5 would require a vase(5,J) and next(J,6); there is no way to bootstrap that because cats 5 is not present and other dependencies loop or fail.\n      - wretched could add next 5 6 only if collect(...) preconditions matched: wretched needs collect o1 o3 and collect o2 o3 for the same o3; the initial collect facts are collect 6 2 and collect 7 3, they do not share a common o3, so no choice of parameters satisfies wretched's collect requirements to make next 5 6.\n    - So next(5,6) cannot be created from the initial state, hence tightfisted cannot be applied to produce next(9,6) either.\n\nBecause every possible way to create next object_9 object_6 either requires next object_9 object_6 already (circular) or needs some precondition that cannot be made true from the initial facts (cats for object_5, matching collect facts, or a next that would be destroyed by the required preparatory action), next object_9 object_6 is unreachable from the given initial state with the available operators.\n\nConclusion: there is no valid plan that achieves the goal (next object_8 object_7 and next object_9 object_6) from the provided initial conditions. If you want, I can:\n- produce a formal unsolvability certificate listing the impossibility cases shown above, or\n- show what minimal additional fact(s) would make the goal reachable (for example, adding cats object_5 or a second collect that matches one of the existing ones), and then produce a plan.

follows:\n\n[PLAN]",
      "response": "Short answer: there is no valid plan that achieves all four goal facts simultaneously from the given initial state. Two of the four goals (next object_12 object_11 and next object_13 object_8) are reachable; next object_14 object_10 and next object_15 object_9 are not reachable given the operator preconditions and the given initial facts. I give a short proof sketch of impossibility and a feasible subsequence that achieves the two reachable goals.\n\nReasoning (why full goal is impossible)\n- To set next h t for a hand object h (h ∈ {object_12,13,14,15}) you must use one of the operators that add next o0 o2:\n  - paltry(o0,o1,o2) — requires vase(o0,o1) and cats(o1). cats exist only for object_0 and object_1, so paltry can only use o1 ∈ {object_0,object_1}. That means paltry can only create next h t when next object_0 t or next object_1 t is already available. But object_0 and object_1's next can only ever point to nodes in {object_6,object_9} (memory uses springs object_6 and object_9), so paltry cannot make a hand point to object_10 or object_11 (these are not in {6,9}).\n  - tightfisted(o0,o1,o2) — requires vase(o0,o1) and sneeze(o1). The only sneezes are object_4 and object_5. So to create next h t via tightfisted we must pick o1 ∈ {object_4,object_5}, and we must already have next o1 t. Therefore for a hand to become linked to object_10 (t = object_10) via tightfisted we need next object_4 object_10 or next object_5 object_10. Object_4's reachable set (by wretched) is {object_6,7,8}; object_5's reachable set is {object_9,10,11}. So only object_5 can produce object_10 as its next.\n- But tightfisted also requires vase(h, object_5). The only way to get vase(h,object_5) is clip(h,object_5,x) (or sip, but sip needs cats(object_5) which is false). clip(h,object_5,x) requires next h x and next object_5 x simultaneously. So a vase(h,object_5) can be created only if h's current next equals some x that object_5 currently points at. For object_14 initial next = object_7, while object_5's reachable set is {object_9,10,11} — there is no common x. To change next object_14 to some x in {9,10,11} would itself require a paltry/tightfisted that depends on having an appropriate vase or sneeze precondition — circular and not satisfiable with the available sneeze/cat/spring distribution. In short: there is no way to create the necessary vase(object_14,object_5) (and so no way to apply tightfisted to make next object_14 object_10). The same kind of obstruction blocks next object_15 object_9.\n- Therefore achieving both next object_14 object_10 and next object_15 object_9 is impossible from the given initial facts.\n\nFeasible partial plan (achieves next object_12 object_11 and next object_13 object_8)\nThe following sequence is valid from the initial state and yields next object_12 object_11 and next object_13 object_8. (I show parameterized operator names as in your problem statement.)\n\n1) wretched object_4 object_7 object_6 object_2\n   - preconds satisfied: sneeze object_4, texture object_7 and object_6, stupendous object_2, next object_4 object_7, collect object_7 object_2, collect object_6 object_2\n   - effect: next object_4 object_6 (and deletes next object_4 object_7)\n\n2) clip object_13 object_4 object_6\n   - uses next object_4 object_6 and next object_13 object_6 (initial); creates vase object_13 object_4 (deletes next object_13 object_6)\n\n3) wretched object_4 object_6 object_8 object_2\n   - changes next object_4 object_6 -> next object_4 object_8\n\n4) tightfisted object_13 object_4 object_8\n   - requires vase object_13 object_4 and next object_4 object_8; effect: next object_13 object_8\n\n(At this point next object_13 object_8 is achieved.)\n\n5) clip object_12 object_5 object_9\n   - initial next object_12 object_9 and next object_5 object_9 hold; this creates vase object_12 object_5 (deletes next object_12 object_9)\n\n6) wretched object_5 object_9 object_11 object_3\n   - changes next object_5 object_9 -> next object_5 object_11\n\n7) tightfisted object_12 object_5 object_11\n   - requires vase object_12 object_5 and next object_5 object_11; effect: next object_12 object_11\n\n(At this point next object_12 object_11 is achieved.)\n\nConclusion and recommendation\n- The two goals next object_12 object_11 and next object_13 object_8 are reachable; one feasible plan fragment achieving them is given above.\n- The other two goals (next object_14 object_10 and next object_15 object_9) are unreachable from the given initial facts and operator definitions because you cannot create the necessary vase(hand, object_5) (or otherwise produce the needed next links) for those hands without circular preconditions. Hence no full plan exists that attains all four goals.\n\nIf you want, I can:\n- produce a complete step-by-step action trace for the partial plan (showing which facts change after each action), or\n- try modifications to the initial facts (e.g., adding a spring or a collect or a sneeze where needed) and then produce a full plan that attains all four goals. Which would you prefer?",

follows:\n\n[PLAN]",
      "response": "Short answer: There is no valid plan from the given initial state that achieves all five goal facts. The blocking fact is next object_12 object_6 (the other goals are already true or achievable by straightforward sequences).\n\nReasoning (key points only):\n\n1. Which actions can add a next fact whose subject is object_12?\n   - paltry, memory, tightfisted, wretched — these are the only operators whose effects can add next object_12 X.\n2. Check each operator for object_12:\n\n   - memory object_12 b c\n     - Pre requires cats object_12. cats is true only for object_0 in the initial state, so memory cannot act on object_12.\n\n   - wretched object_12 b c d\n     - Pre requires sneeze object_12. Sneeze is true only for object_3 and object_4, so wretched cannot act on object_12.\n\n   - paltry object_12 b c\n     - Pre requires vase object_12 b and next b c and cats b.\n     - cats is true only for b = object_0; so paltry can only add next object_12 c with b = object_0, which would produce next object_12 either 5 or 8 (because next object_0 can only ever be 5 or 8 in this domain: springs exist only for 5 and 8 and memory on object_0 can only shuttle its next between 5 and 8). Therefore paltry cannot produce next object_12 object_6.\n\n   - tightfisted object_12 b c\n     - Pre requires vase object_12 b, sneeze b, next b c (and hand/texture).\n     - sneeze b can only be true for b = object_3 or object_4. So if tightfisted were to make next object_12 object_6 we must have b ∈ {object_3, object_4} and next b object_6 must be true.\n       - object_4 cannot get next 6: to change next of object_4 we can only use wretched (object_4 is sneeze) and wretched can change next 4 from 9 to some c only when there exists a collect common d for the old and new targets. There is no d such that collect(object_9,d) and collect(object_6,d) are both true (collects for 9 is with d=2; for 6 is with d=1), so object_4 cannot get next 6.\n       - object_3 can get next 6 (wretched 3 7 6 1 is valid: sneeze 3, next 3 7, texture 7 & 6 present, stupendous 1, collect 7 1 and collect 6 1). So next object_3 object_6 can be made true.\n       - therefore the only hope to get next object_12 object_6 via tightfisted is to (a) make next object_3 object_6, and (b) create vase object_12 object_3, then do tightfisted object_12 object_3 object_6.\n\n3. Why the tightfisted route fails (the crucial impossibility):\n   - Making next object_3 object_6 is possible (wretched 3 7 6 1).\n   - But creating vase object_12 object_3 requires using clip or sip with subject object_12:\n     - sip object_12 object_3 c requires cats object_3 — cats holds only for object_0, so sip cannot create vase_12_3.\n     - clip object_12 object_3 c requires next object_12 c and next object_3 c for the same c. Initially next object_12 object_8 is true and next object_3 object_7 is true. To use clip to make vase_12_3 you would need to make next object_3 equal to the current next of object_12 (i.e. 8) or else change next object_12 to equal next object_3; but:\n       - next object_3 cannot be made 8 (there is no collect d common to 7 and 8, so wretched cannot change 3→8), and\n       - next object_12 cannot be changed except by the operators already considered (paltry, memory, tightfisted, wretched) — and those routes all either require vase_12_X (circular) or cats/object_12 or sneeze/object_12 (absent). So next object_12 cannot be made to match next object_3 so that clip can produce vase_12_3.\n   - Therefore vase object_12 object_3 cannot be produced, hence tightfisted object_12 object_3 object_6 cannot be executed. The needed precondition for adding next object_12 object_6 cannot be established.\n\n4. Conclusion\n   - Because there is no way to create the required vase object_12 object_3 (or otherwise apply an operator that would directly add next object_12 object_6), the goal next object_12 object_6 is unattainable from the given initial state and operators. Hence the overall goal set is unreachable.\n\nIf you want, I can:\n- produce a maximal reachable subset plan (i.e., show how to achieve the other goal facts that are achievable: next object_13 object_5 and next object_15 object_8), or\n- propose small changes to the initial state (e.g., give object_12 the sneeze or cats property, or add an extra collect fact linking 6 and 8) that would make the full goal reachable and then produce a concrete plan.

      "response": "I examined the second problem and searched for a valid action sequence that achieves the goal (next 12 7, next 13 7, next 14 6, next 15 6, next 16 9) from the given initial facts and the six action schemas you provided.\n\nShort answer: there is no valid plan. The required target next facts for object_13, object_14 and object_16 cannot be produced given the precondition structure of the actions and the initial facts. Below I give the key, decisive reasoning (a compact impossibility proof) showing why a plan cannot reach the goal.\n\nKey observations about how next facts can be created\n- Only four actions ever add next X Y:\n  - paltry(hand, cat, texture) adds next(hand, texture)\n  - tightfisted(hand, sneeze, texture) adds next(hand, texture)\n  - wretched(sneeze, t1, t2, stup) adds next(sneeze, t2)\n  - memory(cat, s1, s2) adds next(cat, s2)\n- To produce next for a hand (subjects object_12..object_16), the only applicable adders are paltry or tightfisted (because memory affects cats and wretched affects sneeze subjects).\n\nWhy next object_13 object_7 is impossible\n- paltry(hand H, cat C, texture T) requires:\n  - vase(H,C) and next(C,T) (and cat C exists)\n  - So to add next(object_13, object_7) via paltry we would need a cat C with next(C, object_7).\n  - The only cats are object_0 (next 6) and object_1 (next 9). There is no next(cat, object_7) initially.\n  - The only action that can change a cat's next is memory(cat, s1, s2), but memory requires spring(s2) to hold for the destination; there is no spring(object_7) in the initial facts. Therefore we cannot make any cat acquire next ... object_7. So paltry cannot produce next(object_13, object_7).\n- tightfisted(hand H, sneeze S, texture T) requires:\n  - vase(H,S) and next(S,T) (and S must be a sneeze)\n  - To get next(object_13, object_7) via tightfisted we could pick S = a sneeze that can be made to have next(..., object_7). Sneeze objects present: object_4 (next 8) and object_5 (next 10).\n  - We can make next(object_4, object_7) by wretched(object_4, 8, 7, stup2) because collect(8,2) and collect(7,2) and stupendous object_2 are available — so next(object_4,7) is achievable.\n  - But tightfisted also requires vase(object_13, object_4). How can we obtain vase(object_13, object_4)? The only action that creates a vase with a sneeze as second argument is clip(hand, sneeze, texture), and clip requires next(sneeze, texture) and next(hand, texture) for the same texture. After we make next(object_4,7) by wretched, clip(object_13,object_4,7) would require next(object_13,7) already to be true. That is circular: we would need the target next(object_13,7) already in order to create the vase needed to produce it. There is no other action that can create vase(object_13,object_4) without already having next(object_13,7). Therefore tightfisted cannot be used to produce next(object_13,7).\n- Both paltry and tightfisted routes to produce next(object_13,object_7) are blocked; one requires a cat with next to 7 (unconstructible because memory needs spring 7 which is absent) and the other requires a vase that cannot be produced except by already having next(object_13,7). So next(object_13,7) is unreachable.\n\nBecause next(object_13,object_7) is unreachable, the whole goal set is unreachable (a plan that achieves the full goal cannot exist).\n\nSimilar deadlocks apply to next(object_16,object_9) and next(object_14,object_6) when you trace their required vase / shared-next preconditions: creation of the necessary vase or of a cat/sneeze next to the needed texture would require the very next facts we are trying to produce (or require springs that are absent). So they are not constructible either.\n\nConclusion\nNo valid plan exists from the given initial state to the stated goal. The obstruction is structural: paltry and tightfisted (the only ways to make a hand-pointing next) each require a vase or an already-matching next that cannot be manufactured without the very target next already present (or require spring facts that are not available). Thus the goal is unreachable.\n\nIf you want, I can:\n- produce a more formal counterexample / reachability search trace showing all required predecessors and why each is blocked, or\n- suggest small changes to the initial facts (e.g., add spring object_7 or a different collect/stupendous pairing) that would make a plan possible and then produce a concrete plan for that modified instance.",

      "response": "I examined the domain and the second problem instance you gave (the initial facts and the goal set). I could not find any complete valid plan that achieves all five goal facts simultaneously. Briefly, the reason is an invariant/partitioning constraint in this domain that prevents the required cross-group moves for some hand objects.\n\nKey points / invariant that makes the goal unreachable\n- The textures that appear as \"next\" targets form two disjoint collect-groups in the initial facts:\n  - Group A = {object_6, object_7, object_8} (they share collect ... object_2)\n  - Group B = {object_9, object_10, object_11} (they share collect ... object_3)\n- Sneeze objects (object_4 and object_5) initially point into one of these groups:\n  - next(object_4) = object_8 ∈ Group A\n  - next(object_5) = object_9 ∈ Group B\n- The only action that can change a sneeze object's next is wretched, and wretched can only change next(o0) from one texture to another texture that shares the same collect-object (it requires collect(o1,o3) and collect(o2,o3)). That confines a sneeze object's next to stay inside its initial collect-group (wretched cannot move a sneeze object's next from Group A to Group B or vice versa).\n- For a hand-object to adopt a new next you must use paltry (hand with a cat) or tightfisted (hand with a sneeze). Both paltry and tightfisted require a vase(hand,partner) to exist. A vase is created either by sip (hand + cat) or clip (hand + sneeze). Both sip and clip require that the hand and the partner currently share the same next target (next(hand, t) and next(partner, t)), so to create a vase with a sneeze you must already have next(hand) equal to next(sneeze).\n- Consequently, to get a hand from Group A to Group B (or vice versa) you would need to create a vase with a partner whose next is in the target group. But creating that vase requires the hand already to share the partner's next (i.e., to already be in that group). That is circular unless there is some other action that can move the hand across groups without needing a vase — there is none.\n\nApplied to your goals\n- Initial hand nexts:\n  - object_12 → object_10 (Group B)\n  - object_13 → object_8 (Group A)\n  - object_14 → object_8 (Group A)\n  - object_15 → object_8 (Group A)\n  - object_16 → object_11 (Group B)\n- Goals require:\n  - object_12 → object_10 (already satisfied)\n  - object_13 → object_6 (Group A → Group A) — this is feasible (clip + wretched + tightfisted pattern works, because both are inside Group A and collect constraints allow moving within group)\n  - object_14 → object_9 (Group A → Group B) — requires crossing from A to B\n  - object_15 → object_9 (Group A → Group B) — requires crossing from A to B\n  - object_16 → object_8 (Group B → Group A) — requires crossing from B to A\n\nBecause sneeze and cat targets are stuck inside their initial collect-groups and because creating the required vase to copy a partner's next is only possible when the hand already shares the partner's next, the cross-group moves needed for object_14, object_15, and object_16 cannot be performed. Therefore there is no valid plan that simultaneously achieves all five goal next facts.\n\nWhat I can do next\n- If you want, I can:\n  - produce a maximal partial plan that achieves the reachable subset (for example, change object_13 → object_6 while keeping the others unchanged), or\n  - search exhaustively to confirm unsolvability (with detailed trace), or\n  - if you can relax the goal (e.g., allow object_14 or object_15 to end in Group A instead of object_9), produce a full plan for the relaxed goal, or\n  - suggest minimal changes to the initial facts or operators that would make the original goal reachable (for example, give a sneeze object a collect linking to the other group or allow a wretched-like action to move across collect-groups).\n\nTell me which of those you prefer and I will proceed.",

      "response": "Short answer: I cannot find a complete valid plan that achieves all six goal facts from your second initial state. Several required steps are blocked by mutually dependent preconditions, so the full goal set is unreachable with the available actions.\n\nExplanation (key blockers)\n- Which actions can create next facts?\n  - wretched creates next(o0,o2) but requires sneeze(o0). Only objects with sneeze are object_3 and object_4, so wretched can only change next for subjects 3 and 4.\n  - memory creates next(o0,o2) but requires cats(o0). cats is only true for object_0, so memory can only change next for subject 0.\n  - tightfisted and paltry can create next(o0,o2) for arbitrary o0, but both require a vase(o0,o1) as a precondition (tightfisted also requires sneeze(o1); paltry requires cats(o1) so paltry's o1 must be object_0).\n- Consequence: to get next for subjects 11, 12, 13, 16 you must ultimately either\n  - use a wretched with that subject as the sneeze-argument (impossible because they are not sneeze objects), or\n  - use paltry/tightfisted which require a vase(o0,o1). Vases can be created by clip or sip.\n- Vase creation constraints:\n  - clip(o0,o1,o2) creates vase(o0,o1) but requires sneeze(o1) and next(o0,o2) and next(o1,o2).\n    - So clip needs both next(o0,o2) (i.e., the subject already has some next to the same o2) and next(o1,o2) (the sneeze object must also have that same next). That makes many clip uses circular unless those next facts already exist.\n  - sip(o0,o1,o2) also creates a vase but requires cats(o1) — cats is only true for object_0 — and next(o0,o2) (so sip is circular for generating a new next unless next(o0,o2) already exists).\n- Putting that together for your concrete goals:\n  - Goal next(object_12, object_8): the natural route is tightfisted(12, 4, 8) because object_4 is the only sneeze object that already has next(...,8) (next 4 8 is initially true). tightfisted(12,4,8) requires vase(12,4). To make vase(12,4) with clip you need next(12,X) and next(4,X) for some texture X. The only existing next(12,…) is next(12,7). So one would need next(4,7). But next(4,7) is not present and cannot be produced by wretched because the collect facts required to turn 4->8 into 4->7 are not available (collects for 7 and 8 don't share a common stupendous index). Other alternatives (paltry or sip making vase(12,0) and paltry producing next(12,8)) are blocked because paltry requires vase(12,0) but vase(..,0) cannot be produced by clip (0 is not a sneeze object) and sip would require next(12,8) already. So next(12,8) is blocked.\n  - Goal next(object_13, object_8) is blocked by the same kind of dependency: you would need a vase(13,4) (or an equivalent) but making a vase for 13 via clip would require a next(13,X) matching next(4,X) that doesn't exist and cannot be manufactured since 13 is not sneeze and paltry/memory/sip routes are circular or impossible.\n  - Goal next(object_11, object_5) faces similar circularities: paltry would require vase(11,0) (can't be produced), tightfisted would require vase(11,3) or vase(11,4) and next(3,5) or next(4,5) to be present; next(3,5) can be made (wretched 3 7 5 1 is possible), but creating vase(11,3) via clip requires next(11,X) and next(3,X) for some X that matches an existing next(11,X) — the only existing next(11,…) is next(11,9), and making next(3,9) is not possible with the available collect facts. So that route is blocked as well.\n  - Goal next(object_16, object_8) is the only one for which I found a feasible local route: you can toggle next(4,8) ↔ next(4,9) with wretched(4,8,9,2) and wretched(4,9,8,2) (these are valid given the collect/stupendous/texture facts), then do clip(16,4,9) to make vase(16,4) (requires next(16,9) which initially exists), and finally tightfisted(16,4,8) to create next(16,8). So next(16,8) is reachable alone or as a partial goal.\n\nConclusion\n- Because actions that can manufacture next facts for subjects 11,12,13 require vases whose creation is circular or impossible given the initial next/collect/cats/sneeze facts, the full goal set is not reachable from the given initial state.\n- I can:\n  - produce a partial plan that achieves the reachable subgoal next(object_16, object_8), or\n  - attempt an exhaustive search (but this may confirm infeasibility and take time), or\n  - you can modify the initial facts (for example, add a collect that pairs object_7 and object_8 for the same stupendous index, or add cats/sneeze/spring facts) so a full plan becomes possible.\n\nIf you want, I will:\n- output the short partial plan that achieves next(object_16,object_8), or\n- run a bounded search and report whether any plan exists up to a given depth (say depth 8 or 12).

      "response": "I examined the second scenario (the second [STATEMENT] / goal block). Short answer: with the domain rules you gave and the second initial state, the goal set is not reachable as-is — at least one required next(...) cannot be produced because the needed action preconditions cannot be satisfied from the available facts. I’ll summarize the decisive blockers and give options for how to proceed.\n\nKey constraints and useful observations\n- Only objects with sneeze are object_3 and object_4. Any action that requires sneeze b must use b = 3 or 4.\n- Only object_0 has cats. So paltry/sip require the cats argument to be object_0 (that restricts paltry and sip).\n- memory can only change next for object_0 because it requires cats object_0 and next object_0 X as a precondition. Also memory can only swap object_0 between spring objects; spring objects given are 5 and 8, so memory can only flip next object_0 between 5 and 8.\n- collect groups (needed by wretched) group textures by which stupendous they are collected to:\n  - stupendous object_1: textures 5,6,7\n  - stupendous object_2: textures 8,9,10\n  That means wretched can change a sneeze-node's next value only within the same collect group (e.g., for sneeze 3 initially next 3 5, wretched can change 3->6 or 3->7 but cannot change 3->8).\n- Many actions that create a vase (clip or sip) require next(...) facts that are not present initially, so you often need to create those next facts first — but in many cases those next facts cannot be created because they would require vase facts that cannot be created either (circular requirements).\n\nDecisive impossibility example (one goal already impossible)\n- Goal requires next object_11 object_5, but initial has next object_11 object_8.\n  - Ways to create next 11 5:\n    - paltry 11 0 5 would add next 11 5 if preconditions hold: hand 11 (OK), cats 0 (OK), texture 5 (OK), vase 11 0 (NOT present), and next 0 5 (initially present). So the missing piece is vase 11 0.\n    - tightfisted 11 b 5 requires hand 11, sneeze b, texture 5, next b 5, and vase 11 b. The only sneeze b with next b 5 initially is b=3 (next 3 5 is present), so we would need vase 11 3.\n  - Can we produce vase 11 0 or vase 11 3 from available actions?\n    - sip 11 0 c would produce vase 11 0, but sip requires next 11 c and next 0 c. The only next for 11 initially is next 11 8, so c would have to be 8; but next 0 8 is false initially (next 0 5 only), and memory is the only way to change next 0, but memory 0 5 8 would delete next 0 5. More importantly, sip 11 0 8 requires next 11 8 and next 0 8 — next 0 8 doesn't exist and cannot be made except by memory 0 5 8, but that memory would delete next 0 5 (paltry 11 0 5 needed next 0 5) and anyway we would still be missing the vase before paltry.\n    - clip 11 3 c would produce vase 11 3, but clip requires next 11 c and next 3 c. The only next for 11 initially is 8, so c=8; but next 3 8 is false and cannot be made by wretched because 3 is in collect group 1 (5,6,7) and cannot be moved to 8 (which is in group 2). Thus vase 11 3 cannot be manufactured.\n  - Because neither vase 11 0 nor vase 11 3 can be produced under the current facts, next 11 5 cannot be produced by any allowed action chain. Therefore the goal set is unreachable.\n\nBecause next object_11 object_5 is unreachable, the full goal set is unreachable. (If one goal literal is unreachable, the conjunction cannot be achieved.)\n\nOther goal items\n- Some other goal literals are more plausible to reach (e.g., next 13 7 might be reachable by manipulating sneeze 4 to have next 4 10 with wretched and then using clip/tightfisted chains), but since at least one goal literal is provably impossible, the overall goal is impossible as-stated.\n\nWhat I can do next (choose one)\n1) If you want, I can run a full systematic forward-search (bounded depth) to try to either find a plan or prove unreachable up to a depth bound. That will give a definitive answer within the bound and (if found) a valid action sequence.\n2) If you accept small changes to the initial facts (examples that would unblock the impossible step):\n   - add next object_3 object_8 (or make next 3 able to reach 8 via collect/stupendous changes) so clip 11 3 8 can create vase 11 3; or\n   - add vase 11 0 initially (or add a way to produce it), or add collect links to let wretched change next 3 into texture 8 — any of these would enable creation of next 11 5.\n   If you tell me which minimal change you're willing to allow, I will produce a concrete plan.\n3) If you want me to attempt an alternative goal set (a maximal subset of the requested goals that is reachable) I can compute that and provide a plan to reach those reachable goal literals.\n\nWhich would you like me to do? If you want the automated search, say whether you prefer a breadth-first (shortest plan) or depth-limited search, and a max depth to try.",

      "response": "I examined the domain and the second problem instance you gave (initial facts and goal). Short answer: there is no valid plan that achieves all six requested next facts from the given initial state. Below I give the key argument (a short, general invariant) and then apply it to the problematic goal facts so you can see why the instance is unsolvable as stated.\n\nKey observation / invariant\n- The only actions that can add next(H, T) where H is a hand-object (H ∈ {object_12..object_17}) are:\n  - paltry(H, y, T) — requires vase(H, y) and next(y, T) (y must be a cat),\n  - tightfisted(H, y, T) — requires vase(H, y) and next(y, T) (y must be a sneeze).\n  (clip and sip create vase facts, but clip creates vase(hand, sneeze) and sip creates vase(hand, cat).)\n- A vase(hand, sneeze) or vase(hand, cat) can only be introduced by clip(hand, Y, Z) or sip(hand, Y, Z).\n  - clip(hand, sneezeY, Z) requires both next(hand, Z) and next(sneezeY, Z) (it creates vase(hand, sneezeY) but only if next(hand,Z) already held),\n  - sip(hand, catY, Z) requires both next(hand, Z) and next(catY, Z) (it creates vase(hand, catY) but only if next(hand,Z) already held).\n- Therefore: to create a new vase(hand, ·) for a hand H, either H must already have next(H, Z) for some Z (so clip/sip can be applied) or an existing vase(hand, ·) must already be present. In other words, creating the vase required to later use paltry/tightfisted is circular unless the hand already shares a next-target with the sneeze/cat you want to use.\n\nConsequences for your goals\n- Consider the goal next(object_13, object_10). object_13 is a hand. The only ways to add next(object_13, object_10) are paltry or tightfisted for object_13 (memory/wretched don't act on hands). Both paltry and tightfisted require a vase(object_13, Y) already present. Such a vase could only be created by clip or sip, but clip/sip both require next(object_13, Z) already true for some Z (and in clip's case next(Y, Z) too). So you cannot create the vase needed to later add next(object_13, object_10) unless next(object_13, Z) already matched the sneeze/cat you want to use. In the initial state object_13 points to object_7; the sneeze objects point only to textures in their collect-group (object_4 to {6,7,8}, object_5 to {9,10,11}). To get a vase(object_13, object_5) (needed to use tightfisted with sneeze 5 and then follow to 10), you would need next(object_13, Z) = next(object_5, Z) for some Z — that is not true initially, and there is no way to make object_13 share a Z with object_5 without already having the vase (the same circular dependency). Concretely: object_13 cannot gain the vase with sneeze 5 or with any cat that points to 10, because no cat points to 10 and you cannot create the needed vase without next(object_13, 10) already holding. So next(object_13, object_10) is unreachable.\n- Because next(object_13, object_10) is required by the goal but provably unreachable, the whole goal set cannot be achieved.\n\nWhich goal facts could be achievable\n- Some hand-target goals are reachable by the pattern used in your first plan: if a hand H already shares a next-target Z with some sneeze S, then clip(H,S,Z) can create vase(H,S), then wretched can move S among textures in S's collect-group, and tightfisted(H,S,T) can set next(H,T). Concretely from your initial facts:\n  - object_15 and object_16 initially share next = object_9 with sneeze object_5, so they can be manipulated as in your first-plan pattern (clip -> wretched(sneeze) -> tightfisted).\n  - Hands that do NOT initially share a next-target with any sneeze/cat cannot get the necessary vase to use paltry/tightfisted, so their desired next facts cannot be created.\n\nConclusion\n- Because at least one required goal next(object_13, object_10) is unreachable under the given rules and initial facts, there is no valid plan that achieves the entire goal set you asked for.\n- If you want a satisfiable instance, two simple ways to make it possible:\n  1. Give object_13 an initial next to some Z that also equals next of a sneeze that can reach object_10 (for example set next object_13 object_9 so it matches sneeze object_5), or\n  2. Add an initial vase(object_13, object_5) (or vase(object_13, some cat) together with next(cat, object_10)), so paltry/tightfisted can be used to add next(object_13, object_10).\n- If you want, I can:\n  - (a) produce a concrete plan that achieves the subset of reachable goal facts (e.g., set object_15 -> object_11 and object_16 -> object_7), or\n  - (b) produce a modified initial state (one of the minimal changes above) that makes the full goal reachable and then produce a full plan.\n\nWhich would you prefer?",

The only actions that add vase are sip and clip, but both require next object_12 object_Y (they require next object_0 object_2 with object_0 = 12). So producing vase(12,…) requires already having next(12,…) — circular dependency.\n- No action produces sneeze or cats facts, so we cannot create cats(12) or sneeze(12) from other actions.\n- Therefore there is no way to introduce the necessary precondition to an action that would add next(12,8). The goal next(12,8) is unreachable.\n\nWhat would make the goal reachable (suggestions):\n- Add cats object_12 to the initial state (then memory could be used if appropriate next/spring facts align), or\n- Add sneeze object_12 to the initial state (allows wretched/tightfisted to be used if other preconditions can be met), or\n- Add some vase object_12 object_X initially, or\n- Add next object_12 object_S (for some S) initially (breaking the circularity so sip/clip could create a vase and then paltry/tightfisted could produce next(12,8)).\n\nIf you want, tell me which initial fact(s) you are willing to add and I will produce a valid plan.",

      "response": "I checked the domain and the second problem instance (initial facts + goal next object_9 object_7). Conclusion: with the given initial facts and available actions, the goal next object_9 object_7 is not reachable. \n\nWhy (brief, high-level proof):\n- Only these actions can create next facts: paltry, wretched, memory, tightfisted.\n- To get next object_9 object_7 we must instantiate one of those with the produced pair (object_0 = object_9, object_2 = object_7) or produce an intermediate next that can be turned into next 9 7.\n- memory would require cats object_9 (not present) — so memory cannot produce next 9 7.\n- paltry would require cats X for its second parameter; the only cats fact is cats object_0, so paltry would need to be paltry object_9 object_0 object_7. That requires vase object_9 object_0 to exist. There is no way to produce vase object_9 object_0 with the available facts: clip would need sneeze object_0 (which we do not have), and sip would require next object_9 object_7 already (circular). So paltry cannot be used.\n- tightfisted would need some sneeze object_s such that next object_s object_7 and vase object_9 object_s both hold. Creating vase object_9 object_s via clip or sip again requires next facts that either are circular (require next 9 7 already) or impossible given missing sneeze/cats facts. Creating next object_s object_7 itself would require wretched (but wretched needs collects that must match and a pre-existing next from that sneeze to another texture), and attempts to chain these also run into missing collect/sneeze/circular requirements.\n- wretched cannot be applied with object_0 = 9 because wretched requires sneeze object_0 and there is no sneeze object_9.\n\nBecause all routes are blocked (either missing required predicates like cats(9) or sneeze(0), or circular prerequisites that require next(9,7) to exist before it can be made), the goal is unreachable from the given initial state.\n\nIf you are willing to allow a small change to the initial facts, there is a simple way to make the goal reachable. Minimal helpful addition:\n- Add vase object_9 object_0 as an initial fact.\n\nThen this 2-step plan achieves the goal:\n1) memory object_0 object_5 object_7\n   - preconds satisfied: cats object_0, spring object_5, spring object_7, next object_0 object_5\n   - effect: sets next object_0 object_7\n2) paltry object_9 object_0 object_7\n   - preconds satisfied after step 1: hand object_9, cats object_0, texture object_7, vase object_9 object_0 (added), next object_0 object_7\n   - effect: sets next object_9 object_7 (goal achieved)\n\nIf you prefer, I can:\n- try to find a plan under different allowed initial additions (e.g., adding sneeze object_0 or cats object_9), or\n- search exhaustively for reachability under the original facts (I already reasoned it is impossible, but I can produce a more detailed step-by-step impossibility trace if you want).

      "response": "I checked the actions and the second problem instance (initial facts and goal next object_10 object_6). Conclusion: the goal is not reachable from the given initial facts. Below is a concise justification showing every way to make next object_10 object_6 is blocked.\n\n1) Which actions can add next object_10 object_6?\n   - Only actions whose first argument is object_10 can add a next fact with object_10 as first element. That is: paltry(10,.,6), wretched(10,.,6,.), memory(10,.,6), or tightfisted(10,.,6).\n\n2) Check each possibility:\n\n   - wretched(10, ...) requires sneeze object_10. There is no sneeze object_10 in the initial facts, and no action can create sneeze facts. So wretched with first argument 10 is impossible.\n\n   - memory(10, a, 6) requires cats object_10. There is no cats object_10 initially, and no action creates cats, so memory(10, ...) is impossible.\n\n   - paltry(10, y, 6) requires:\n     - hand object_10 (present),\n     - cats y (the only cats available are object_0 and object_1),\n     - texture object_6 (present),\n     - vase object_10 y (must already exist),\n     - next y object_6 (next object_1 object_6 exists; next object_0 object_6 does not).\n     So only y = object_1 is viable wrt cats and next. But vase object_10 object_1 must exist beforehand. The only actions that create vase are sip and clip:\n       - sip(10,1,6) would require next object_10 object_6 already (circular: needs the goal).\n       - clip(10,1,6) would require sneeze object_1 (not present). There is no way to create sneeze object_1.\n     Therefore paltry(10,1,6) cannot be achieved.\n\n   - tightfisted(10, y, 6) requires:\n     - hand object_10 (present),\n     - sneeze y (only sneeze objects present are object_4 and object_5),\n     - texture object_6 (present),\n     - next y object_6,\n     - vase object_10 y.\n     So y must be one of {object_4, object_5}.\n       - For y = object_4: next object_4 object_6 is present (good), but vase object_10 object_4 must be created. Vase can only be made by sip or clip, and both require next object_10 Z for some Z. To create vase(10,4) by clip you would need next object_10 Z already — that is the same circular dependency (or would require next 4 Z that doesn’t hold for the same Z). In short, there is no way to produce vase(10,4) from the given facts without already having next object_10 object_6.\n       - For y = object_5: vase object_10 object_5 can be produced initially by clip object_10 object_5 object_9 (preconds satisfied: hand 10, sneeze 5, texture 9, next 5 9, next 10 9). That gives vase(10,5). But tightfisted(10,5,6) additionally requires next object_5 object_6. next object_5 object_9 is present initially, and the only action that could change next object_5 something is wretched(5,...), but wretched(5,...) requires collect facts that do not match the available collect facts (there is no common stupendous/collect combination that permits turning next 5 9 into next 5 6). No other action can create next object_5 object_6. Thus tightfisted(10,5,6) is blocked.\n\n3) Summary\n   - Every possible action that could add next object_10 object_6 is either directly blocked (missing required atomic facts like sneeze(10) or cats(10)), or requires vase(10,y) which itself cannot be produced without already having next object_10 something (circular), or needs next y 6 that cannot be produced from the given facts. Therefore next object_10 object_6 is unreachable.\n\nIf you want, I can:\n- produce the maximal set of reachable facts from the initial state (to show what can be done), or\n- propose minimal additions to the initial facts that would make the goal reachable (for example, adding one of: sneeze object_10, cats object_10, or collect facts that let wretched(5,...) produce next 5 6), or\n- try to find a concrete plan after you modify the initial facts as above.

      "response": "I checked the available actions and the second initial state. The two subgoals are not both achievable together; however next object_10 object_7 is achievable. Below I give a correct plan for achieving next object_10 object_7 and then explain why next object_11 object_8 cannot be achieved under the given axioms.\n\nPlan to achieve next object_10 object_7\n1) clip object_10 object_4 object_6\n   - Preconditions satisfied: hand object_10, sneeze object_4, texture object_6, next object_4 object_6, next object_10 object_6 (all present initially).\n   - Effect: creates vase object_10 object_4.\n\n2) wretched object_4 object_6 object_7 object_2\n   - Preconditions satisfied: sneeze object_4, texture object_6, texture object_7, stupendous object_2, next object_4 object_6, collect object_6 object_2, collect object_7 object_2 (all present).\n   - Effect: creates next object_4 object_7 (and deletes next object_4 object_6).\n\n3) tightfisted object_10 object_4 object_7\n   - Preconditions satisfied after the previous steps: hand object_10, sneeze object_4, texture object_7, next object_4 object_7 (from step 2), and vase object_10 object_4 (from step 1).\n   - Effect: creates next object_10 object_7 (and deletes vase object_10 object_4).\n\nSo next object_10 object_7 is achieved.\n\nWhy next object_11 object_8 is impossible\n- The only actions that can add a next fact whose subject is object_11 are:\n  - paltry (adds next hand texture with hand = object_11) — requires a vase object_11 catsX plus next catsX texture.\n  - tightfisted (adds next hand texture with hand = object_11) — requires a vase object_11 sneezeY plus next sneezeY texture.\n  - memory (adds next for a cats subject) — requires cats object_11 (but cats object_11 is not in the initial state).\n  - wretched (adds next for a sneeze subject) — requires sneeze object_11 (but sneeze object_11 is not in the initial state).\n  None of the available actions can create new cats(...) or sneeze(...) atoms, so the memory/wretched routes for subject object_11 are unavailable.\n\n- Therefore we must create some vase object_11 Z and then use paltry/tightfisted to get next object_11 object_8. To create vase object_11 Z we must use clip or sip. Both clip and sip require two next facts that share the same texture T: next object_11 T (already present only for T=9 in the initial state) and next Z T. So T must be 9 and we must produce next Z 9 for some Z that is a valid sneeze/cats as required.\n\n- The only candidate Z for which we can produce next Z 9 is Z = object_5 via wretched(5,8,9,3) (this is exactly the wretched that turns next object_5 object_8 into next object_5 object_9). But wretched(5,8,9,3) deletes next object_5 object_8 as part of its effect. If we then use clip(11,5,9) to create vase object_11 object_5, tightfisted(11,5,8) would require next object_5 object_8 — which no longer exists (it was deleted). There is no other action available that can re-create next object_5 object_8 (it would require cats(5) or hand(5) that we do not have), so you cannot simultaneously have vase object_11 object_5 and next object_5 object_8.\n\n- All other routes to create the needed vase object_11 Z run into the same circularity: to make a vase for object_11 you need an existing next object_11 T; initially only next object_11 9 exists, so you must use T=9; to get the corresponding next Z 9 you must perform actions that inevitably destroy the next link needed later for tightfisted/paltry, so you cannot produce next object_11 object_8 without violating preconditions.\n\nConclusion\n- A plan exists that achieves next object_10 object_7 (given above).\n- There is no plan (sequence of the given actions) that achieves next object_11 object_8 from the given initial state together with next object_10 object_7 — next object_11 object_8 is unreachable under the given domain and initial facts.",
