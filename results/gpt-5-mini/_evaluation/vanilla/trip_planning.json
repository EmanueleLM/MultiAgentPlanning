A workable 13‑day itinerary that respects direct‑flight constraints and has Porto on days 10–11 (wedding) is:\n  - Days 1–5: Krakow (5 days)\n    - Fly Krakow → Berlin on morning of day 6 (direct)\n  - Days 6–9: Berlin (4 of the 6 Berlin days)\n    - Fly Berlin → Porto on morning of day 10 (direct)\n  - Days 10–11: Porto (2 days; wedding)\n    - Fly Porto → Berlin on morning of day 12 (direct)\n  - Days 12–13: Berlin (remaining 2 Berlin days)\n  - Total: 13 days, Berlin total = 4+2 = 6, Krakow = 5, Porto = 2\n  - All intercity flights are direct (Krakow↔Berlin and Berlin↔Porto only).\n\nOption B — Keep total trip = 11 days by reducing one or more stays\nHere are a couple of simple 11‑day examples (all flights are direct and follow Krakow→Berlin→Porto order so no Porto↔Krakow direct needed):\n\n1) Keep Berlin = 6 days and Porto = 2 days; shorten Krakow to 3 days:\n  - Days 1–3: Krakow (3)\n    - Fly Krakow → Berlin day 4\n  - Days 4–9: Berlin (6)\n    - Fly Berlin → Porto day 10\n  - Days 10–11: Porto (2; wedding)\n  - Total = 11 days.\n\n2) Keep Krakow = 5 days and Berlin = 6 days; shorten Porto to 0 or 0–? (not meeting your Porto 2 requirement) — not recommended if Porto attendance is fixed.\n\nOption C — If non‑contiguous stays are acceptable, but total must stay 11\n- Non‑contiguous does not solve the basic sum problem: the required totals still sum to 13, so you would still need 13 days. Splitting a city visit helps only with placement around the wedding, not with total days.\n\nSummary and next step\n- If you must have the exact city-day totals you listed, change total trip length to 13 days — I provided a 13‑day plan that meets all constraints (Option A).\n- If total trip must be 11 days, tell me which city length(s) you’re willing to shorten and whether stays must be contiguous; I’ll produce a direct-flight–only itinerary that matches your revised constraints.\n- Also confirm what “between day 10 and day 11” precisely means for the wedding (day 10, night 10–11, or either day).\n\nTell me which option you prefer or provide the clarifications and I’ll give a complete day‑by‑day itinerary and suggested flight days.",

If you don’t want same‑day connections, another 12‑day ordering is possible but may move Reykjavik out of days 8–10.\n\n2) Keep the trip at 10 days — reduce one of the city stays so the totals = 10. For example reduce Split to 5 days:\n   - Total: Split 5d + Frankfurt 2d + Reykjavik 3d = 10 days\n   - Feasible itinerary (uses only direct flights):\n     - Days 1–5: Split (5 days)\n     - Day 6: Fly Split → Frankfurt (direct) — Frankfurt day 6\n     - Day 7: Frankfurt day 7 (2 days in Frankfurt completed)\n     - Day 8: Fly Frankfurt → Reykjavik (direct) — start Reykjavik\n     - Days 8–10: Reykjavik (3 days; workshop in the requested window)\n\n3) If you only need to attend the workshop sometime between days 8–10 (not necessarily that all 3 Reykjavik days must be exactly days 8–10) we can shift parts of the Reykjavik stay so at least one Reykjavik day falls on day 8–10 while keeping the total trip length 10.
