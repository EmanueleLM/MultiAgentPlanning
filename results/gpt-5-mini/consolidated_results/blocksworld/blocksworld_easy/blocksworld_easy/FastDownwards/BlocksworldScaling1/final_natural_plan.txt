Below is a clear, human-readable sequence of the two actions in the plan, matching each planned step exactly and showing the stage/time progression, preconditions and effects.

Initial state (stage s0, t = 0)
- on(red, orange)
- on(yellow, red)
- ontable(blue)
- ontable(orange)
- clear(blue)
- clear(yellow)
- handempty
- at-stage s0

Plan (each action advances the global stage by one successor link; treat each action as taking 1 time unit):

1) Action: pick-up(blue) — stage s0 -> s1 (time t = 0 → t = 1)
- Natural-language description: At time t=0 (stage s0), pick up the block blue from the table with the single hand.
- Preconditions checked before performing the action:
  - blue is on the table (ontable(blue))
  - blue is clear (no block on top of it) (clear(blue))
  - the hand is empty (handempty)
  - current stage is s0 and s0 has a successor s1
- Effects that occur at completion (stage becomes s1, time t=1):
  - blue is no longer on the table (not ontable(blue))
  - blue is not clear while being held (not clear(blue))
  - the hand is no longer empty (not handempty)
  - the agent is holding blue (holding(blue))
  - stage advances to s1 (at-stage s1)

2) Action: stack(blue, yellow) — stage s1 -> s2 (time t = 1 → t = 2)
- Natural-language description: At time t=1 (stage s1), place (stack) the held block blue on top of block yellow.
- Preconditions checked before performing the action:
  - the agent is holding blue (holding(blue))
  - yellow is clear (clear(yellow))
  - current stage is s1 and s1 has a successor s2
- Effects that occur at completion (stage becomes s2, time t=2):
  - the agent is no longer holding blue (not holding(blue))
  - blue is on top of yellow (on(blue, yellow))
  - yellow is no longer clear (not clear(yellow))
  - blue becomes clear (no block on top of it) (clear(blue))
  - the hand becomes empty (handempty)
  - stage advances to s2 (at-stage s2)

Final state after plan (stage s2, t = 2) — Goal verification
- on(red, orange) (unchanged, still true)
- on(yellow, red) (unchanged, still true)
- on(blue, yellow) (established by step 2)
- Therefore the goal (red on orange, blue on yellow, yellow on red) is satisfied at stage s2 (time t = 2).

Notes:
- Each action respects single-handed constraints and the hand-empty / holding predicates are tracked explicitly across stages.
- Time is represented by stages s0→s1→s2; each action advances the stage by one successor link (treated here as 1 time unit per action).
