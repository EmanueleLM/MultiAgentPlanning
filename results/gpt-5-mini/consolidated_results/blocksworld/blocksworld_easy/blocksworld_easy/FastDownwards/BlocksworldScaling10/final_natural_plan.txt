Summary of initial state (stage s0 / time t=0)
- Blocks: red on blue, yellow on orange; blue and orange on the table.
- clear: red, yellow
- hand: empty
- Current stage: s0 (t = 0)
Goal: orange on red, and reach stage s4 (t = 4)

Plan (each action advances the stage by one succ relation; interpret s0→s1→s2→s3→s4 as times t=0→1→2→3→4; each action takes 1 time unit):

1) t = 0 → 1  — unstack yellow from orange (unstack yellow orange s0 s1)
- Preconditions at t=0: yellow is on orange, yellow is clear, hand is empty. (These hold in the initial state.)
- Action: the agent un-stacks yellow off orange.
- Effects after t=1: yellow is no longer on orange, yellow is held, yellow is not on the table, orange becomes clear, hand is not empty.
- New stage: s1 (t = 1)

2) t = 1 → 2  — put-down yellow on the table (put-down yellow s1 s2)
- Preconditions at t=1: agent is holding yellow. (Satisfied after step 1.)
- Action: the agent puts yellow down onto the table.
- Effects after t=2: yellow is on the table, yellow is clear, hand becomes empty, agent is no longer holding yellow.
- New stage: s2 (t = 2)

3) t = 2 → 3  — pick-up orange from the table (pick-up orange s2 s3)
- Preconditions at t=2: orange is on the table and clear, hand is empty. (Orange was initially on the table and became clear in step 1; hand became empty in step 2.)
- Action: the agent picks up orange from the table.
- Effects after t=3: orange is no longer on the table, orange is held, orange is not clear, hand is not empty.
- New stage: s3 (t = 3)

4) t = 3 → 4  — stack orange onto red (stack orange red s3 s4)
- Preconditions at t=3: agent is holding orange, and red is clear. (Red was clear initially and has remained clear.)
- Action: the agent stacks the held orange onto red.
- Effects after t=4: orange is on red, orange is clear, red is no longer clear, agent is no longer holding orange, hand becomes empty.
- New stage: s4 (t = 4)

Final state (after t = 4 / at s4)
- orange is on red (goal condition satisfied)
- stage s4 reached (goal stage satisfied)
- hand is empty

The plan matches the provided sequence exactly, preserves the single-hand constraint, and achieves the goal.
