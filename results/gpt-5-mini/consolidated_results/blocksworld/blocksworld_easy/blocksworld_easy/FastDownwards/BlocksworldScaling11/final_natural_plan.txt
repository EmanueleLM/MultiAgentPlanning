Plan cost = 4 (each action = 1 time unit). Timestamps assume actions execute sequentially starting at time 0; each action duration = 1 time unit.

1) Time 0 → 1 (duration 1) — unstacker: unstack blue from yellow (unstacker-unstack blue yellow s0 s1)
- Preconditions checked at time 0: handempty; (on blue yellow); clear blue. (All satisfied by the initial state.)
- Action performed: unstack blue off of yellow into the single hand.
- Effects at time 1: blue is now held (holding blue); blue is no longer on yellow; blue is no longer clear; yellow becomes clear; hand is no longer empty; stage advanced from s0 to s1.

2) Time 1 → 2 (duration 1) — stacker: stack blue onto orange (stacker-stack-on blue orange s1 s2)
- Preconditions checked at time 1: holding blue; clear orange. (Both satisfied after step 1 and from initial clear orange.)
- Action performed: place the held blue block on top of orange.
- Effects at time 2: blue is on orange; orange is no longer clear; blue becomes clear (nothing on top of it); blue is no longer held; hand becomes empty; blue is no longer on the table; stage advanced from s1 to s2.

3) Time 2 → 3 (duration 1) — unstacker: pick up yellow from the table (unstacker-pickup-from-table yellow s2 s3)
- Preconditions checked at time 2: handempty; ontable yellow; clear yellow. (Yellow is on the table and was made clear in step 1; hand is empty after step 2.)
- Action performed: pick up yellow from the table into the hand.
- Effects at time 3: yellow is no longer on the table; yellow is being held (holding yellow); yellow is no longer clear; hand is not empty; stage advanced from s2 to s3.

4) Time 3 → 4 (duration 1) — stacker: stack yellow onto red (stacker-stack-on yellow red s3 s4)
- Preconditions checked at time 3: holding yellow; clear red. (Holding satisfied by step 3; red was clear initially and has not lost that property.)
- Action performed: place the held yellow block on top of red.
- Effects at time 4: yellow is on red; red is no longer clear; yellow becomes clear; yellow is no longer held; hand becomes empty; yellow is no longer on the table; stage advanced from s3 to s4.

Final state at time 4:
- on blue orange (blue on orange) — achieved
- on yellow red (yellow on red) — achieved
- handempty — satisfied
- at-stage s4 — satisfied

This sequence exactly follows the provided plan and satisfies the specified goal.
