Plan (4 actions, using time steps step0 → step4)

Initial relevant facts (time = step0): yellow is on orange; red, blue, and orange are on the table; red, blue, and yellow are clear; hand is empty.

1) Action: unstack yellow from orange
   - Time: step0 → step1
   - Operation: lift yellow off of orange (unstack yellow from on top of orange).
   - Preconditions (at step0): on(yellow, orange); clear(yellow); handempty; current = step0.
   - Effects (after step1): holding(yellow) (hand becomes nonempty); yellow is no longer on orange; clear(orange) becomes true; current = step1.

2) Action: stack yellow onto red
   - Time: step1 → step2
   - Operation: place the held yellow onto top of red (stack yellow on red).
   - Preconditions (at step1): holding(yellow); clear(red); current = step1.
   - Effects (after step2): on(yellow, red); clear(yellow) becomes true; clear(red) becomes false; hand becomes empty (not holding any block); current = step2.

3) Action: pick-up orange from table
   - Time: step2 → step3
   - Operation: pick up orange from the table (pick-up orange).
   - Preconditions (at step2): on-table(orange); clear(orange); handempty; current = step2.
   - Effects (after step3): holding(orange) (hand becomes nonempty); orange is no longer on-table; clear(orange) becomes false; current = step3.

4) Action: stack orange onto blue
   - Time: step3 → step4
   - Operation: place the held orange onto top of blue (stack orange on blue).
   - Preconditions (at step3): holding(orange); clear(blue); current = step3.
   - Effects (after step4): on(orange, blue); clear(orange) becomes true; clear(blue) becomes false; hand becomes empty; current = step4.

Result after step4 (goal conditions): current = step4, on(orange, blue), on(yellow, red). The single-handed constraint is respected throughout (only one block held at any time).
