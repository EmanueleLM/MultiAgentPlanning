Plan (human-readable, step-by-step). Each action takes 1 time unit and advances the orchestrator from stageN to stageN+1.

1) Time 0 → 1 — Pick up red (pickup orchestrator red stage0 stage1)
   - Agent: orchestrator
   - Preconditions before the action:
     - orchestrator's hand is empty
     - red is on the table
     - red is clear (nothing on top of red)
     - orchestrator at stage0
   - Effect after the action:
     - orchestrator is holding red
     - orchestrator's hand is not empty
     - red is no longer on the table
     - red is not clear (it is being held)
     - orchestrator now at stage1

2) Time 1 → 2 — Stack red on blue (stack orchestrator red blue stage1 stage2)
   - Agent: orchestrator
   - Preconditions before the action:
     - orchestrator is holding red
     - blue is clear
     - orchestrator at stage1
   - Effect after the action:
     - orchestrator's hand becomes empty
     - orchestrator is no longer holding red
     - red is on blue
     - blue is not clear (red is on top)
     - red becomes clear (nothing on top of red)
     - red is not on the table
     - orchestrator now at stage2

3) Time 2 → 3 — Unstack orange from yellow (unstack orchestrator orange yellow stage2 stage3)
   - Agent: orchestrator
   - Preconditions before the action:
     - orchestrator's hand is empty
     - orange is on yellow
     - orange is clear
     - orchestrator at stage2
   - Effect after the action:
     - orchestrator is holding orange
     - orchestrator's hand is not empty
     - yellow becomes clear (orange removed)
     - orange is no longer on yellow
     - orange is not on the table
     - orange is not clear (it is being held)
     - orchestrator now at stage3

4) Time 3 → 4 — Stack orange on red (stack orchestrator orange red stage3 stage4)
   - Agent: orchestrator
   - Preconditions before the action:
     - orchestrator is holding orange
     - red is clear
     - orchestrator at stage3
   - Effect after the action:
     - orchestrator's hand becomes empty
     - orchestrator is no longer holding orange
     - orange is on red
     - red is not clear (orange on top)
     - orange becomes clear (nothing on top)
     - orange is not on the table
     - orchestrator now at stage4

Final check (after Time 4):
- on red blue — satisfied
- on orange red — satisfied

This sequence exactly follows the provided plan, respects single-hand constraints and clear semantics, and reaches the stated goal.
