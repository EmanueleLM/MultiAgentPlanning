Plan cost: 4 (each action = 1 time unit). Actions are executed sequentially.

Step 1 — time 0.0 → 1.0
Action: unstack yellow from blue
- Preconditions (satisfied): on(yellow, blue); clear(yellow); handempty.
- Effects: holding(yellow); clear(blue); not on(yellow, blue); not clear(yellow); not handempty.
State after step 1:
- Holding: yellow.
- On: blue on red (yellow removed).
- Clear: blue, orange. Hand not empty.

Step 2 — time 1.0 → 2.0
Action: stack yellow on orange
- Preconditions (satisfied): holding(yellow); clear(orange).
- Effects: on(yellow, orange); clear(yellow); handempty; not holding(yellow); not clear(orange).

- Clear: yellow, (blue still clear). Hand empty.

Step 3 — time 2.0 → 3.0
Action: unstack blue from red
- Preconditions (satisfied): on(blue, red); clear(blue); handempty.
- Effects: holding(blue); clear(red); not on(blue, red); not clear(blue); not handempty.
