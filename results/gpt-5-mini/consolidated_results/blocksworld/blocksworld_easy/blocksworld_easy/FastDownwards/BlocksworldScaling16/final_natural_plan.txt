Plan (4 steps). Each action corresponds to advancing the discrete stage by one successor (s0→s1→s2→s3→s4). Treat each action as taking 1 time unit: t0 (s0) → t1 (s1) → t2 (s2) → t3 (s3) → t4 (s4).

1) Time t0 → t1 — block_picker picks up blue
- Action: block_picker-pick-up(blue, s0, s1)
- Preconditions (checked at t0 / current = s0):
  - blue is on the table (ontable blue)
  - blue is clear (clear blue)
  - hand is empty (handempty)
  - blue is not already held (not holding blue)
  - current stage is s0 and s1 is its successor (current s0, succ s0 s1)
- Effects (applied at t1 / current becomes s1):
  - remove (ontable blue) — blue is no longer on the table
  - remove (clear blue) — picked block is not clear while held
  - remove (handempty) — hand becomes not empty
  - add (holding blue) — agent is holding blue
  - advance stage: remove (current s0), add (current s1)
- Resulting notable state at t1: holding(blue), hand not empty, current = s1. orange remains on red and clear; yellow and red unaffected.

2) Time t1 → t2 — block_stacker stacks blue onto orange
- Action: block_stacker-stack(blue, orange, s1, s2)
- Preconditions (checked at t1 / current = s1):
  - holding blue
  - orange is clear (clear orange)
  - orange is not being held (not holding orange)
  - current stage s1 and succ s1 s2
- Effects (applied at t2 / current becomes s2):
  - add (on blue orange) — blue is now on top of orange
  - ensure (not (ontable blue)) — blue is not on the table
  - add (clear blue) — the top block (blue) is clear after stacking
  - remove (holding blue) — blue is no longer held
  - add (handempty) — hand becomes empty
  - remove (clear orange) — orange is no longer clear (has blue on top)
  - advance stage: remove (current s1), add (current s2)
- Resulting notable state at t2: on(blue, orange), clear(blue), not clear(orange), handempty, current = s2.

3) Time t2 → t3 — block_picker picks up yellow
- Action: block_picker-pick-up(yellow, s2, s3)
- Preconditions (checked at t2 / current = s2):
  - yellow is on the table (ontable yellow)
  - yellow is clear (clear yellow)
  - hand is empty (handempty)
  - yellow is not already held (not holding yellow)
  - current stage s2 and succ s2 s3
- Effects (applied at t3 / current becomes s3):
  - remove (ontable yellow) — yellow is no longer on the table
  - remove (clear yellow)
  - remove (handempty)
  - add (holding yellow)
  - advance stage: remove (current s2), add (current s3)
- Resulting notable state at t3: holding(yellow), hand not empty, current = s3. Blue remains on orange and clear; orange not clear.

4) Time t3 → t4 — block_stacker stacks yellow onto blue
- Action: block_stacker-stack(yellow, blue, s3, s4)
- Preconditions (checked at t3 / current = s3):
  - holding yellow
  - blue is clear (clear blue)
  - blue is not being held (not holding blue)
  - current stage s3 and succ s3 s4
- Effects (applied at t4 / current becomes s4):
  - add (on yellow blue) — yellow is now on top of blue
  - ensure (not (ontable yellow)) — yellow is not on the table
  - add (clear yellow)
  - remove (holding yellow)
  - add (handempty)
  - remove (clear blue) — blue is no longer clear (has yellow on top)
  - advance stage: remove (current s3), add (current s4)
- Resulting notable state at t4: on(yellow, blue) and on(blue, orange), hand empty, current = s4.

Final check (at t4): goal satisfied — blue is on orange (on blue orange) and yellow is on blue (on yellow blue). Plan matched exactly the provided sequence; total cost = 4 actions (4 time units).
