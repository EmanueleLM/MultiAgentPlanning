Plan (human-readable), matching the provided PDDL plan exactly. Each action is shown with a timestamp (unit duration = 1.0 time unit). For each step I list the action, the time window, a one-line justification showing that preconditions hold, and the main immediate effects on relevant fluents.

Step 1 — pick-up(red)
- Time: 0.0 → 1.0 (duration 1.0)
- Action: Pick up the red block from the table (hand takes red).
- Preconditions checked: red is on the table, red is clear, hand is empty — all true in the initial state.
- Immediate effects: holding(red) becomes true; red is no longer on the table; red is no longer clear; hand becomes not empty.
- Notes: stage advances internally as in the domain encoding.

Step 2 — stack(red, yellow)
- Time: 1.0 → 2.0 (duration 1.0)
- Action: Stack the held red block onto yellow.
- Preconditions checked: holding(red) is true (from Step 1), yellow is clear (initially true) — legal to stack.
- Immediate effects: on(red, yellow) becomes true; red is not on the table; red becomes clear; hand becomes empty; yellow becomes not clear.
- Notes: after this step red sits on top of yellow.

Step 3 — pick-up(orange)
- Time: 2.0 → 3.0 (duration 1.0)
- Action: Pick up the orange block from the table.
- Preconditions checked: orange is on the table and clear (never had anything placed on it), and the hand is empty (from Step 2) — legal to pick up.
- Immediate effects: holding(orange) becomes true; orange is no longer on the table; orange is no longer clear; hand becomes not empty.

Step 4 — stack(orange, red)
- Time: 3.0 → 4.0 (duration 1.0)
- Action: Stack the held orange block onto red.
- Preconditions checked: holding(orange) is true (from Step 3) and red is clear (red became clear after Step 2) — legal to stack.
- Immediate effects: on(orange, red) becomes true; orange is not on the table; orange becomes clear; hand becomes empty; red becomes not clear.

Final state verification (after time 4.0)
- on(red, yellow) — true (from Step 2).
- on(orange, red) — true (from Step 4).
- Hand is empty.
- Goal achieved: red on yellow and orange on red.
