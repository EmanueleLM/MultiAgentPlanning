Initial state (time t=0, stage s0)
- Blocks: blue on red; orange on yellow; red on table; yellow on table.
- Clear: blue, orange.
- Hand: empty.
- Current stage: s0. Stages advance s0→s1→s2→s3→s4.

Plan (each action takes 1 time unit)

1) t=0 → t=1 (stage s0 → s1): unstack orange from yellow
- Action: unstack(orange, yellow, s0, s1)
- Preconditions satisfied: orange is on yellow, orange is clear, hand is empty, current stage is s0, next(s0,s1) holds.
- Effects (after t=1): agent is holding orange; orange is no longer on yellow; orange is no longer on the table; orange is not clear (because it is held); yellow becomes clear; hand is no longer empty; current stage becomes s1.

2) t=1 → t=2 (stage s1 → s2): put-down orange onto the table
- Action: put-down(orange, s1, s2)
- Preconditions satisfied: agent holding orange, current stage s1, next(s1,s2) holds.
- Effects (after t=2): orange is on the table (ontable orange); orange is clear; hand becomes empty; agent is no longer holding orange; current stage becomes s2.

3) t=2 → t=3 (stage s2 → s3): pick-up yellow from the table
- Action: pick-up(yellow, s2, s3)
- Preconditions satisfied: yellow is on the table, yellow is clear (it became clear at step 1), hand is empty, current stage s2, next(s2,s3) holds.
- Effects (after t=3): agent is holding yellow; yellow is no longer on the table; yellow is not clear (because it is held); hand is not empty; current stage becomes s3.

4) t=3 → t=4 (stage s3 → s4): stack yellow onto orange
- Action: stack(yellow, orange, s3, s4)
- Preconditions satisfied: agent holding yellow, orange is clear (put-down left orange clear), current stage s3, next(s3,s4) holds.
- Effects (after t=4): yellow is on orange; yellow becomes clear; agent is no longer holding yellow; hand becomes empty; orange is no longer clear; yellow is not on the table; current stage becomes s4.

Final state (time t=4, stage s4)
- Achieved goal: blue on red AND yellow on orange.
- Hand: empty.
