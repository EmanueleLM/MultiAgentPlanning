1) unstack(red, yellow) — time s0 -> s1
   - Action: Unstack the red block from on top of the yellow block.
   - Required preconditions at s0: (at s0), (next s0 s1), (on red yellow), (clear red), (handempty).
   - Preconditions satisfied in the initial state: red is on yellow, red is clear, and the hand is empty at s0.
   - Effects after s1: red is no longer on yellow, the agent is holding red, the hand is not empty, red is not clear, yellow becomes clear, the marker at s0 is removed and (at s1) holds.

2) putdown(red) — time s1 -> s2
   - Action: Put the held red block down onto the table.
   - Required preconditions at s1: (at s1), (next s1 s2), (holding red).
   - Preconditions satisfied at s1: from step 1 the agent is holding red and (at s1) holds.
   - Effects after s2: red is no longer held, the hand becomes empty, red is on the table (ontable red), red becomes clear, the marker at s1 is removed and (at s2) holds.

3) pickup(yellow) — time s2 -> s3
   - Action: Pick up the yellow block from the table.
   - Required preconditions at s2: (at s2), (next s2 s3), (ontable yellow), (clear yellow), (handempty).
   - Preconditions satisfied at s2: yellow was on the table initially and became clear in step 1; after step 2 the hand is empty, so all pickup preconditions hold.
   - Effects after s3: yellow is no longer on the table, the agent is holding yellow, the hand is not empty, yellow is not clear, the marker at s2 is removed and (at s3) holds.

4) stack(yellow, blue) — time s3 -> s4
   - Action: Stack the held yellow block on top of the blue block.
   - Required preconditions at s3: (at s3), (next s3 s4), (holding yellow), (clear blue).
   - Preconditions satisfied at s3: the agent is holding yellow (from step 3) and blue remained clear throughout, and (at s3) holds.
   - Effects after s4: yellow is no longer held, the hand becomes empty, yellow is on blue (on yellow blue), blue is no longer clear, yellow becomes clear, yellow is no longer on the table, the marker at s3 is removed and (at s4) holds.

Result after s4
   - Achieved goal facts: (on blue orange) (unchanged from the initial state) and (on yellow blue) (established in step 4).
   - Time marker: (at s4) holds (as required by the goal).
   - Hand status: handempty (after final stack).
   - Plan cost: 4 unit steps (one per action).
