Plan (human-readable sequence) — initial facts relevant: hand is empty; on(red, orange); on(blue, yellow); ontable(orange), ontable(yellow); clear(red), clear(blue); current stage = s1. Goal: on(red, orange) and on(blue, red).

Step 1
- Action: picker-unstack(blue, yellow)
- Agent: picker
- Stage / timestamp: executes from s1 → s2 (current s1, next s1 s2)
- Preconditions (all true at s1):
  - handempty (the hand is empty)
  - on(blue, yellow) (blue is on yellow)
  - clear(blue) (nothing on top of blue)
  - current = s1 and next(s1, s2)
- Description: picker un-stacks the clear block blue from on top of yellow, lifting it into the hand.
- Duration / timing: one stage (s1 to s2)
- Effects (resulting state changes at completion of the step):
  - Positive effects:
    - holding(blue) — picker is now holding blue
    - clear(yellow) — yellow becomes clear (nothing on it)
    - current = s2 (stage advances)
  - Negative effects (facts removed):
    - not on(blue, yellow) — blue is no longer on yellow
    - not handempty — the hand is no longer empty
    - not clear(blue) — blue is not considered clear while it is held
- Brief postcondition summary (after step 1, at stage s2):
  - holding(blue), clear(yellow), hand not empty, on(red, orange) still holds, on(blue, yellow) no longer holds, current = s2.

Step 2
- Action: stacker-stack(blue, red)
- Agent: stacker
- Stage / timestamp: executes from s2 → s3 (current s2, next s2 s3)
- Preconditions (all true at s2):
  - holding(blue) (block blue is currently held by the agent)
  - clear(red) (target block red is clear)
  - current = s2 and next(s2, s3)
- Description: stacker places the held block blue onto the top of red, completing the desired stacking.
- Duration / timing: one stage (s2 to s3)
- Effects (resulting state changes at completion of the step):
  - Positive effects:
    - on(blue, red) — blue is now on red
    - clear(blue) — blue, as the top block, is clear
    - handempty — the hand becomes empty again
    - current = s3 (stage advances)
  - Negative effects:
    - not ontable(blue) — blue is not on the table
    - not holding(blue) — blue is no longer held
    - not clear(red) — red is no longer clear (has blue on top)
- Brief postcondition summary (after step 2, at stage s3):
  - on(red, orange) (unchanged from the initial state)
  - on(blue, red) (achieved by this step)
  - hand is empty, clear(blue) true, clear(red) false, current = s3.

Final check
- All plan steps from the given plan were used in order and no steps were added or removed.
- Single-hand mutual exclusion and hand-empty preconditions were respected: the hand was empty at s1, picker unstacked blue and held it through s2, and stacker consumed the held block at s2 and restored handempty at s3.
- Clear predicate semantics maintained: removing blue made yellow clear; stacking blue onto red made red not clear and blue clear.
- Goal status (after step 2): satisfied — on(red, orange) and on(blue, red).

Plan cost: 2 actions (unit cost per action).
