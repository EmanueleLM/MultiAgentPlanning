Plan (matches given plan exactly). Each action duration = 1 time unit; timestamps shown as [start, end).

Step 1 — t = [0, 1): unstack red blue
- Action: unstack(red, blue)
- What it does: pick up the red block from on top of the blue block into the single hand.
- Preconditions checked: red is on blue, red is clear, hand is empty.
- Effects (after action): holding(red), blue becomes clear, red is no longer on blue, hand is no longer empty.

Step 2 — t = [1, 2): put-down red
- Action: put-down(red)
- What it does: place the held red block onto the table.
- Preconditions checked: holding(red).
- Effects (after action): red is on the table (ontable), red is clear, hand becomes empty, no longer holding red.

Step 3 — t = [2, 3): unstack blue yellow
- Action: unstack(blue, yellow)
- What it does: pick up the blue block from on top of the yellow block into the single hand.
- Preconditions checked: blue is on yellow, blue is clear (made clear in Step 1), hand is empty (made empty in Step 2).
- Effects (after action): holding(blue), yellow becomes clear, blue is no longer on yellow, hand is no longer empty.

Step 4 — t = [3, 4): stack blue red
- Action: stack(blue, red)
- What it does: place the held blue block on top of the clear red block.
- Preconditions checked: holding(blue), red is clear (true after Step 2).
- Effects (after action): blue is on red (goal achieved), blue is clear, hand becomes empty, red becomes not clear, no longer holding blue.

Goal check:
- Goal (on blue red) is satisfied after Step 4.
- Total cost (unit cost per action): 4.
