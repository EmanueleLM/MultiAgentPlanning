Step 1 — unstack(orange, yellow) [stage s0 → s1]
- Time: t = 0.0 → 1.0 (duration 1.0)
- Action: Unstack the block "orange" from on top of "yellow" into the hand.
- Preconditions checked before step: orange is on yellow; orange is clear; hand is empty; current stage = s0; s1 is the successor of s0.
- Immediate effects after step: agent is holding orange; orange is no longer on yellow; orange is no longer clear; yellow becomes clear; hand is not empty; current stage becomes s1.

Step 2 — stack(orange, red) [stage s1 → s2]
- Time: t = 1.0 → 2.0 (duration 1.0)
- Action: Stack the held block "orange" onto block "red".
- Preconditions checked before step: agent is holding orange; red is clear; current stage = s1; s2 is the successor of s1.
- Immediate effects after step: orange is on red; orange becomes clear; red is no longer clear; agent is no longer holding orange (hand becomes empty); orange is not on the table; current stage becomes s2.

Step 3 — pick-up(blue) [stage s2 → s3]
- Time: t = 2.0 → 3.0 (duration 1.0)
- Action: Pick up the clear block "blue" from the table into the hand.
- Preconditions checked before step: blue is on the table; blue is clear; hand is empty; current stage = s2; s3 is the successor of s2.
- Immediate effects after step: agent is holding blue; blue is no longer on the table; blue is no longer clear; hand is not empty; current stage becomes s3.

Step 4 — stack(blue, yellow) [stage s3 → s4]
- Time: t = 3.0 → 4.0 (duration 1.0)
- Action: Stack the held block "blue" onto block "yellow".
- Preconditions checked before step: agent is holding blue; yellow is clear (became clear in Step 1 and remained clear); current stage = s3; s4 is the successor of s3.
- Immediate effects after step: blue is on yellow; blue becomes clear; yellow is no longer clear; agent is no longer holding blue (hand becomes empty); blue is not on the table; current stage becomes s4.

Summary / Verification
- Total plan duration (sum of action durations): 4.0 time units (cost = 4).
- Final state (after t = 4.0): on blue yellow; on orange red; hand is empty.
- The plan respects single-handedness (hand was empty before each unstack/pick-up, only one block held at a time), maintains clear/on/ontable relations consistently, and reaches the stated goal.
