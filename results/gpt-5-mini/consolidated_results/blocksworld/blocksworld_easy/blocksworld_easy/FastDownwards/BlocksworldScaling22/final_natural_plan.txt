Plan (human-readable, stepwise). Actor: single hand (one manipulator). Assume each action takes 1 time unit; timestamps shown as [start — end).

Initial facts (t = 0):
- handempty
- on yellow orange
- ontable red
- ontable blue
- ontable orange
- clear red
- clear blue
- clear yellow

Step 1 — Unstack yellow from orange
- Time: [0.0 — 1.0)
- Action: Unstack(yellow, orange)
- Actor assumption: single hand, empty at start of step
- Preconditions (must hold at start): (on yellow orange), (clear yellow), (handempty)
- Effects (applied at end):
  - remove (on yellow orange)
  - add (holding yellow)
  - remove (handempty)
  - add (clear orange)     ; orange becomes clear once yellow is removed
  - remove (clear yellow)  ; yellow is being held so not clear
- State after step 1 (t = 1.0) — notable facts:
  - holding yellow
  - clear orange
  - hand not empty
  - no (on yellow orange)

Step 2 — PutDown yellow (onto table)
- Time: [1.0 — 2.0)
- Action: PutDown(yellow)
- Actor assumption: same single hand, currently holding yellow
- Preconditions: (holding yellow)
- Effects:
  - add (ontable yellow)
  - add (handempty)
  - remove (holding yellow)
  - add (clear yellow)
- State after step 2 (t = 2.0):
  - ontable yellow
  - handempty
  - clear yellow
  - clear orange (unchanged from step 1)
  - red and blue remain ontable and clear as initially

Step 3 — PickUp orange (from table)
- Time: [2.0 — 3.0)
- Action: PickUp(orange)
- Actor assumption: single hand, empty at start of step
- Preconditions: (ontable orange), (clear orange), (handempty)
- Effects:
  - remove (ontable orange)
  - remove (handempty)
  - add (holding orange)
  - remove (clear orange)
- State after step 3 (t = 3.0):
  - holding orange
  - not handempty
  - orange no longer on table and not clear
  - yellow remains ontable and clear

Step 4 — Stack orange on yellow
- Time: [3.0 — 4.0)
- Action: Stack(orange, yellow)
- Actor assumption: single hand, currently holding orange
- Preconditions: (holding orange), (clear yellow)
- Effects:
  - add (on orange yellow)
  - add (handempty)
  - remove (holding orange)
  - remove (clear yellow)
  - add (clear orange)
- State after step 4 (t = 4.0):
  - on orange yellow  ← goal achieved
  - handempty
  - orange is clear (nothing on top of it)
  - yellow is no longer clear (orange on top)
  - red and blue unchanged

Total plan duration (sum of action durations): 4.0 time units
Plan cost (unit cost per action): 4

This sequence matches the provided plan exactly and is causally and temporally consistent with the blocks-world rules (single hand, clear predicates, and hand-empty constraints respected at every step).
