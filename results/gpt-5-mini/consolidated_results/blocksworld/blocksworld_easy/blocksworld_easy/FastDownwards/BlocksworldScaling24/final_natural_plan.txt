Plan overview: 4 discrete steps, each advancing the stage by one successor. Treat each action as taking 1 time unit. Start at stage s0 (t = 0). Total cost = 4. Single hand constraint maintained: exactly one block moved at a time.

1) t = 0 → 1 (pick-up-from-block red blue s0 → s1)
   - Action (natural language): Unstack red from on top of blue and pick it up into the hand.
   - Preconditions satisfied: red is on blue, red is clear, hand is free, current stage = s0, next(s0,s1) holds.
   - Effects: red is no longer on blue, blue becomes clear, red is held (hand no longer free), stage advances to s1.
   - State after step: holding(red); blue clear; red not clear (because held); orange, yellow remain on table and clear.

2) t = 1 → 2 (stack-onto-block red yellow s1 → s2)
   - Action (natural language): Place the held block red onto block yellow (stack red on yellow).
   - Preconditions satisfied: holding(red), yellow is clear, red ≠ yellow, current stage = s1, next(s1,s2).
   - Effects: red is now on yellow, red is not on the table, red becomes clear (nothing on it), yellow ceases to be clear, red is no longer held (hand becomes free), stage advances to s2.
   - State after step: on(red,yellow); hand free; yellow not clear; blue remains on table and clear; orange on table and clear.

3) t = 2 → 3 (pick-up-from-table orange s2 → s3)
   - Action (natural language): Pick up orange from the table into the hand.
   - Preconditions satisfied: orange is on the table, orange is clear, hand is free, current stage = s2, next(s2,s3).
   - Effects: orange is no longer on the table, orange is held (not clear while held), hand not free, stage advances to s3.
   - State after step: holding(orange); red on yellow; blue on table and clear; yellow not clear.

4) t = 3 → 4 (stack-onto-block orange blue s3 → s4)
   - Action (natural language): Place the held block orange onto block blue (stack orange on blue).
   - Preconditions satisfied: holding(orange), blue is clear, orange ≠ blue, current stage = s3, next(s3,s4).
   - Effects: orange is now on blue, orange is not on the table, orange becomes clear, orange no longer held (hand becomes free), blue ceases to be clear, stage advances to s4.
   - State after step (final): on(red,yellow) and on(orange,blue); hand free; goal achieved at t = 4.

Goal check: After step 4 (t = 4), both required goal atoms hold: red on yellow and orange on blue.
