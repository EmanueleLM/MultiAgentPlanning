Summary of initial state (time t=0, stage s0)
- Blocks: blue, yellow, orange, red.
- Table: table0.
- Hand: empty (handempty).
- Placements: blue on-table table0; yellow on-table table0; orange on-table table0; red on-table table0.
- Clear: blue, yellow, orange, red are all clear.
- Active stage: s0.

Plan (each action takes 1 time unit; stages s0→s1→s2→s3→s4 correspond to t=0→t1→t2→t3→t4)
1) Time t=0 → t=1 (stage s0 → s1)
   Action: pickup-from-table(blue, table0, s0, s1)
   - Preconditions satisfied at t=0: blue is on-table(table0), blue is clear, hand is empty, stage s0 active, next(s0,s1).
   - Effects applied at t=1:
     • Added: holding(blue), stage-active(s1)
     • Deleted: on-table(blue table0), clear(blue), handempty, stage-active(s0)
   - State after action: agent is holding blue; blue is not on the table; blue is not clear; hand is not empty.

2) Time t=1 → t=2 (stage s1 → s2)
   Action: stack-on-block(blue, yellow, s1, s2)
   - Preconditions satisfied at t=1: holding(blue), yellow is clear, stage s1 active, next(s1,s2).
   - Effects applied at t=2:
     • Added: on(blue, yellow), clear(blue), stage-active(s2), handempty
     • Deleted: clear(yellow), holding(blue), stage-active(s1)
   - State after action: blue is stacked onto yellow (on blue yellow); blue becomes clear; yellow is no longer clear; hand is empty.

3) Time t=2 → t=3 (stage s2 → s3)
   Action: pickup-from-table(orange, table0, s2, s3)
   - Preconditions satisfied at t=2: orange is on-table(table0), orange is clear, hand is empty, stage s2 active, next(s2,s3).
   - Effects applied at t=3:
     • Added: holding(orange), stage-active(s3)
     • Deleted: on-table(orange table0), clear(orange), handempty, stage-active(s2)
   - State after action: agent is holding orange; orange is not on the table; orange is not clear; hand is not empty.

4) Time t=3 → t=4 (stage s3 → s4)
   Action: stack-on-block(orange, red, s3, s4)
   - Preconditions satisfied at t=3: holding(orange), red is clear, stage s3 active, next(s3,s4).
   - Effects applied at t=4:
     • Added: on(orange, red), clear(orange), stage-active(s4), handempty
     • Deleted: clear(red), holding(orange), stage-active(s3)
   - State after action: orange is stacked onto red (on orange red); orange becomes clear; red is no longer clear; hand is empty.

Final state (time t=4, stage s4)
- Goal facts achieved: on(blue, yellow) and on(orange, red) — both true.
- Hand: empty.
- Clear status: blue = clear, orange = clear, yellow = not clear, red = not clear.
- on-table facts unchanged for blocks not moved off the table except where deleted: red and yellow remain on-table if they were never removed by PDDL effects; blue and orange are no longer on-table.
- Plan cost: 4 (unit cost per action).

This sequence follows the given plan exactly (no additions or deletions), respects the one-block-at-a-time and hand-empty constraints, and reaches the goal: blue on yellow and orange on red.
