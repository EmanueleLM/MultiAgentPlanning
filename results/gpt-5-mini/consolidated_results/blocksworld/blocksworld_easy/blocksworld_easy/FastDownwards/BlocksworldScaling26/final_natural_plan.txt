Step 1 — Time 0 → 1 (duration: 1 time unit)
- Action: auditor unstack blue from orange (stage0 → stage1)
- Preconditions at start (all true at time 0):
  - on(blue, orange)
  - clear(blue)
  - hand-empty(auditor)
  - current-stage = stage0
  - next(stage0, stage1)
- Effects (applied at time 1):
  - no longer on(blue, orange)
  - clear(orange)
  - not clear(blue) (blue is being held)
  - not hand-empty(auditor)
  - holding(auditor, blue)
  - current-stage becomes stage1
- Resulting relevant facts after step 1:
  - holding(auditor, blue)
  - clear(orange)
  - on(red, yellow) (unchanged)
  - on(blue, orange) (removed)
  - hand-empty for other agents unchanged (orchestrator, picker, stacker, etc.)

Step 2 — Time 1 → 2 (duration: 1 time unit)
- Action: orchestrator pick-up orange from table (stage1 → stage2)
- Preconditions at start (all true at time 1):
  - ontable(orange)
  - clear(orange)  (set by Step 1)
  - hand-empty(orchestrator)
  - current-stage = stage1
  - next(stage1, stage2)
- Effects (applied at time 2):
  - not ontable(orange)
  - not clear(orange) (orange is being held)
  - not hand-empty(orchestrator)
  - holding(orchestrator, orange)
  - current-stage becomes stage2
- Resulting relevant facts after step 2:
  - holding(auditor, blue)
  - holding(orchestrator, orange)
  - on(red, yellow) (unchanged)
  - current-stage = stage2

Step 3 — Time 2 → 3 (duration: 1 time unit)
- Action: auditor stack blue onto red (stage2 → stage3)
- Preconditions at start (all true at time 2):
  - holding(auditor, blue)
  - clear(red)
  - current-stage = stage2
  - next(stage2, stage3)
- Effects (applied at time 3):
  - on(blue, red)
  - not ontable(blue)
  - not clear(red) (red now has blue on it)
  - clear(blue)
  - hand-empty(auditor)
  - not holding(auditor, blue)
  - current-stage becomes stage3
- Resulting relevant facts after step 3:
  - on(blue, red)
  - holding(orchestrator, orange)
  - clear(blue)
  - not clear(red)
  - current-stage = stage3

Step 4 — Time 3 → 4 (duration: 1 time unit)
- Action: orchestrator stack orange onto blue (stage3 → stage4)
- Preconditions at start (all true at time 3):
  - holding(orchestrator, orange)
  - clear(blue)  (set by Step 3)
  - current-stage = stage3
  - next(stage3, stage4)
- Effects (applied at time 4):
  - on(orange, blue)
  - not ontable(orange)
  - not clear(blue) (blue now has orange on it)
  - clear(orange)
  - hand-empty(orchestrator)
  - not holding(orchestrator, orange)
  - current-stage becomes stage4
- Resulting relevant facts after step 4:
  - on(red, yellow)  (original)
  - on(blue, red)    (from Step 3)
  - on(orange, blue) (from Step 4)
  - current-stage = stage4
  - hand-empty for auditor and orchestrator (they have released their blocks)

Final state (time 4)
- Goal achieved:
  - on(red, yellow)
  - on(blue, red)
  - on(orange, blue)
  - current-stage = stage4

Notes on compliance with specification:
- Each action was executed only when the acting agent’s hand was empty and the required block was clear or on the table, as required.
- Only one block was picked up/unstacked at a time and the stage sequencing (stage0→stage1→stage2→stage3→stage4) enforces the action order.
