Below is a clear, step-by-step execution of the provided plan. Each step matches the plan exactly, shows the stage transition (used as timestamps), lists the action preconditions and confirms they are met, and gives the resulting state snapshot after the action. Each action is assumed to take one stage transition (1 time unit). Initial state (before step 1, current = s0):
- on(blue, orange)
- on(orange, red)
- on(red, yellow)
- ontable(yellow)
- clear(blue)
- handempty
- current s0

Step 1 — Time: s0 -> s1 (t = 0 → 1)
Action: unstack(blue, orange)
- Preconditions checked:
  - on(blue, orange) — true in initial state
  - clear(blue) — true
  - handempty — true
- Resulting effects (applied):
  - removed: on(blue, orange), handempty, clear(blue)
  - added: holding(blue), clear(orange)
  - stage: current becomes s1 (no longer s0)
- State snapshot after step 1:
  - holding(blue)
  - clear(orange)
  - on(orange, red)
  - on(red, yellow)
  - ontable(yellow)
  - not(ontable(blue))
  - not(clear(blue))
  - not(handempty)
  - current s1

Step 2 — Time: s1 -> s2 (t = 1 → 2)
Action: putdown(blue)
- Preconditions checked:
  - holding(blue) — true after step 1
- Resulting effects (applied):
  - removed: holding(blue)
  - added: ontable(blue), clear(blue), handempty
  - stage: current becomes s2
- State snapshot after step 2:
  - ontable(blue)
  - clear(blue)
  - clear(orange)
  - on(orange, red)
  - on(red, yellow)
  - ontable(yellow)
  - handempty
  - current s2

Step 3 — Time: s2 -> s3 (t = 2 → 3)
Action: unstack(orange, red)
- Preconditions checked:
  - on(orange, red) — true after step 2
  - clear(orange) — true after step 1 and unchanged since
  - handempty — true after step 2
- Resulting effects (applied):
  - removed: on(orange, red), handempty, clear(orange)
  - added: holding(orange), clear(red)
  - stage: current becomes s3
- State snapshot after step 3:
  - holding(orange)
  - ontable(blue)
  - clear(blue)
  - clear(red)
  - on(red, yellow)
  - ontable(yellow)
  - not(on(orange, red))
  - not(handempty)
  - current s3

Step 4 — Time: s3 -> s4 (t = 3 → 4)
Action: stack(orange, blue)
- Preconditions checked:
  - holding(orange) — true after step 3
  - clear(blue) — true after step 2 and unchanged
- Resulting effects (applied):
  - removed: holding(orange), clear(blue), ontable(orange) (if it existed)
  - added: on(orange, blue), clear(orange), handempty
  - stage: current becomes s4
- State snapshot after step 4 (final):
  - on(orange, blue)  ← Goal achieved
  - clear(orange)
  - ontable(blue)
  - on(red, yellow)
  - ontable(yellow)
  - handempty
  - current s4

Summary:
- The plan executed exactly the four actions given in the plan, one per stage transition (s0→s1→s2→s3→s4).
- All preconditions were satisfied at the moments actions were applied.
- Final goal (on orange blue) is achieved at current = s4.
- Total cost (unit cost per action) = 4.
