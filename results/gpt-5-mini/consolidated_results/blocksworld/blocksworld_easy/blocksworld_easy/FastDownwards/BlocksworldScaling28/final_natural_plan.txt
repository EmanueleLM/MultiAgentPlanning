Step 1 — Time: stage0 → stage1 (duration 1)
- Agent: picker
- Action: pick up from table
- Parameters: block = red, support = table
- Preconditions checked at stage0: red is on table, red is clear, hand is empty, stage0 is current
- Effects applied at stage1: picker is holding red; red is no longer on the table; red is no longer clear; hand is not empty; current stage becomes stage1

Step 2 — Time: stage1 → stage2 (duration 1)
- Agent: stacker
- Action: stack onto block
- Parameters: block = red (in hand), destination = blue
- Preconditions checked at stage1: red is being held, blue is clear, stage1 is current
- Effects applied at stage2: red is placed on blue (on red blue); red becomes clear (nothing on top of it); hand becomes empty; picker/stacker is no longer holding red; current stage becomes stage2

Step 3 — Time: stage2 → stage3 (duration 1)
- Agent: picker
- Action: pick up from table
- Parameters: block = yellow, support = table
- Preconditions checked at stage2: yellow is on table, yellow is clear, hand is empty, stage2 is current
- Effects applied at stage3: picker is holding yellow; yellow is no longer on the table; yellow is no longer clear; hand is not empty; current stage becomes stage3

Step 4 — Time: stage3 → stage4 (duration 1)
- Agent: stacker
- Action: stack onto block
- Parameters: block = yellow (in hand), destination = red
- Preconditions checked at stage3: yellow is being held, red is clear, stage3 is current
- Effects applied at stage4: yellow is placed on red (on yellow red); yellow becomes clear; hand becomes empty; no longer holding yellow; current stage becomes stage4

Final state (at stage4):
- on red blue (red is on blue)
- on yellow red (yellow is on red)
- current stage4 is reached
- hand is empty

Total actions: 4 (each 1 time unit). Goal achieved: red on blue and yellow on red at stage4.
