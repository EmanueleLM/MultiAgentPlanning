1) t=0.0 — duration 1.0
   Action: Unstack red from blue.
   - Preconditions checked: red is on blue, red is clear, hand is empty.
   - What happens: Builder removes red from top of blue and holds red. As a result: red is no longer on blue, red is not clear (because it's being held), blue becomes clear, and the hand becomes not empty (holding red).

2) t=1.0 — duration 1.0
   Action: Put-down red (place red on the table).
   - Preconditions checked: holding red.
   - What happens: Builder puts red down on the table. As a result: red is on the table and clear, the hand becomes empty, and the builder is no longer holding red.

3) t=2.0 — duration 1.0
   Action: Pick-up yellow from the table.
   - Preconditions checked: yellow is on the table, yellow is clear, hand is empty.
   - What happens: Builder picks up yellow. As a result: yellow is no longer on the table, yellow is not clear (because it's being held), and the hand becomes not empty (holding yellow).

4) t=3.0 — duration 1.0
   Action: Stack yellow onto blue.
   - Preconditions checked: holding yellow, blue is clear.
   - What happens: Builder places yellow on top of blue. As a result: yellow is on blue, yellow becomes clear, blue is no longer clear, the hand becomes empty, and the builder is no longer holding yellow.

Final state highlights:
- blue remains on orange (unchanged throughout).
- yellow is now on blue.
- Both goal conditions are satisfied: (on blue orange) and (on yellow blue).

Total plan cost: 4 (four unit-duration actions). The sequence respects single-handed constraints at every step (hand is empty when required; only one block is held at a time).
