Step 1 — (picker-pickup yellow p0 p1)
- Timestamp: t = 0 to t = 1 (duration: 1 time unit)
- Action (as in plan): picker-pickup yellow p0 p1
- What happens: The picker picks up the block yellow from the table and advances the phase from p0 to p1.
- Preconditions that hold at t=0: yellow is on the table, yellow is clear, the single hand is empty, current phase = p0, and next(p0,p1) holds.
- Effects at t=1 (applied instantaneously at end of the action):
  - yellow is no longer on the table
  - the hand is now holding yellow (holding yellow)
  - yellow is no longer clear (because it is held)
  - the hand is no longer empty
  - current phase is updated: p0 is no longer current and p1 becomes current

Step 2 — (stacker-stack yellow blue p1 p2)
- Timestamp: t = 1 to t = 2 (duration: 1 time unit)
- Action (as in plan): stacker-stack yellow blue p1 p2
- What happens: The stacker stacks the held block yellow onto block blue and advances the phase from p1 to p2.
- Preconditions that hold at t=1: the hand is holding yellow, blue is clear, current phase = p1, and next(p1,p2) holds.
- Effects at t=2 (applied at action completion):
  - yellow is directly on blue (on yellow blue)
  - yellow becomes clear (no block on top of it)
  - blue is no longer clear (yellow is now on top of it)
  - the hand is no longer holding yellow
  - the hand becomes empty
  - current phase is updated: p1 is no longer current and p2 becomes current

Final state after t = 2 (relevant facts)
- on red orange (unchanged from the initial state)
- on yellow blue (goal achieved)
- current p2 (final phase reached)
- handempty (hand is empty)

This sequence exactly follows the provided plan:
(picker-pickup yellow p0 p1)
(stacker-stack yellow blue p1 p2)
