Summary of initial state (t = 0.0)
- Blocks: blue on orange, orange on red, red on table, yellow on table.
- Clear: blue, yellow.
- Agent: orchestrator, hand empty.
- Stage: current = s0 (next s0 -> s1, next s1 -> s2).

Plan (timestamps show start→end; each action is atomic and single-handed)

1) t = 0.0 → 1.0 — unstack orchestrator blue from orange (stage s0→s1)
- Action name: unstack(orchestrator, blue, orange, s0, s1)
- Preconditions (checked at start t=0.0):
  - on(blue, orange)
  - clear(blue)
  - handempty(orchestrator)
  - current = s0 and next(s0, s1) and s1 not current
- Effects (at end t=1.0):
  - not on(blue, orange)  (blue removed from orange)
  - holding(orchestrator, blue)  (orchestrator holds blue)
  - not handempty(orchestrator)
  - clear(orange)  (orange now clear)
  - not clear(blue)
  - stage transitions: current no longer s0; current = s1

State immediately after step 1 (t = 1.0)
- Blocks: orange on red, red on table, yellow on table, blue held by orchestrator
- Clear: orange, (blue not clear because held), yellow
- Agent: orchestrator holding blue
- Stage: current = s1

2) t = 1.0 → 2.0 — stack orchestrator blue onto yellow (stage s1→s2)
- Action name: stack(orchestrator, blue, yellow, s1, s2)
- Preconditions (checked at start t=1.0):
  - holding(orchestrator, blue)
  - clear(yellow)
  - current = s1 and next(s1, s2) and s2 not current
  - blue ≠ yellow (implicit by objects)
- Effects (at end t=2.0):
  - on(blue, yellow)  (blue placed on yellow)
  - handempty(orchestrator)
  - not holding(orchestrator, blue)
  - not clear(yellow)  (yellow now has blue on top)
  - clear(blue)
  - stage transitions: current no longer s1; current = s2

Final state (t = 2.0)
- Blocks: blue on yellow, orange on red, red on table, yellow on table
- Clear: blue (on top), orange
- Agent: orchestrator hand empty
- Stage: current = s2
- Goal satisfied: on(blue, yellow) and on(orange, red)
