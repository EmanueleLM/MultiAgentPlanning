Initial context (time = stage0, t = 0):
- Hand is empty.
- blue is clear and is on top of yellow.
- orange is clear and is on top of red.
- red and yellow are on the table.
- current timepoint: stage0.

Step 1 — unstack blue from yellow (stage0 → stage1), duration = 1 time unit (t = 0 to t = 1)
- Action: unstack(blue, yellow)
- Preconditions checked at stage0: current = stage0, succ(stage0, stage1), hand-empty, clear(blue), on(blue, yellow).
- Effects at stage1:
  - current becomes stage1.
  - manipulator is now holding blue (holding(blue)).
  - hand is no longer empty.
  - blue is no longer on yellow.
  - blue is no longer clear (because it is held).
  - yellow becomes clear (top block removed).

Step 2 — stack blue onto orange (stage1 → stage2), duration = 1 time unit (t = 1 to t = 2)
- Action: stack(blue, orange)
- Preconditions checked at stage1: current = stage1, succ(stage1, stage2), holding(blue), clear(orange), blue ≠ orange.
- Effects at stage2:
  - current becomes stage2.
  - blue is placed on orange (on(blue, orange)).
  - blue becomes clear (no block on top).
  - manipulator's hand becomes empty; not holding blue anymore.
  - orange is no longer clear (now has blue on top).

Result after stage2 (t = 2):
- Goal satisfied: on(blue, orange) and current = stage2.

Total plan cost: 2 (two unit-cost actions).
