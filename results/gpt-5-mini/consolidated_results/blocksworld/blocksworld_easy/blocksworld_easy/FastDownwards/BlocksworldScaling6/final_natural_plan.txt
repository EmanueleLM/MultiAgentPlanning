1) Time / stage: s0 → s1 (timestamp: t=0s → t=1s)
   Action (PDDL name): (manipulator-unstack orange blue s0 s1)
   Natural-language description: The manipulator un-stacks the orange block from on top of the blue block, picks up orange into its single hand.
   Preconditions checked before executing:

     - orange is clear (nothing on top of orange)
     - the hand is empty
     - the world is at stage s0 and s1 is the immediate successor of s0
   Effects after execution:
     - the manipulator is holding orange
     - orange is no longer on blue
     - orange is not clear while being held
     - blue becomes clear (nothing on top)
     - the hand is now not empty
     - the current stage marker advances from s0 to s1

2) Time / stage: s1 → s2 (timestamp: t=1s → t=2s)
   Action (PDDL name): (manipulator-stack orange yellow s1 s2)
   Natural-language description: The manipulator places (stacks) the held orange block onto the clear yellow block, releasing orange and freeing the hand.
   Preconditions checked before executing:
