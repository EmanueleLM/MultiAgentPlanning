Human-readable action sequence (matches the provided plan exactly)

Assumptions: each atomic action takes 1 time unit. Initial state (from sensor): hand is empty; yellow is on the table and clear; red is on the table and clear; orange is on blue (already satisfies part of the goal).

Step 1 — Time 0.0 → 1.0 (duration 1.0)
Action: PICK UP yellow from the table
- Preconditions checked before the action:
  - (ontable yellow) — true
  - (clear yellow) — true
  - (handempty) — true
- Operation performed: pick-up yellow
- Deterministic effects after the action:
  - holding yellow — true
  - (not ontable yellow) — yellow is no longer on the table
  - (not handempty) — the hand is now occupied
  - (not clear yellow) — yellow is not clear while being held

Step 2 — Time 1.0 → 2.0 (duration 1.0)
Action: STACK yellow on red
- Preconditions checked before the action:
  - holding yellow — true (from Step 1)
  - (clear red) — true (red was clear and has not been changed)
- Operation performed: place the held block yellow on top of red
- Deterministic effects after the action:
  - (on yellow red) — true (yellow is now on red)
  - (handempty) — true (the hand becomes empty)
  - (clear yellow) — true (nothing sits on yellow)
  - (not holding yellow) — no longer holding yellow
  - (not clear red) — red is no longer clear (yellow is on it)

Final state relevant to the goal:
- (on orange blue) — unchanged and true
- (on yellow red) — achieved by Step 2

Plan cost: 2 (two unit-cost actions).
