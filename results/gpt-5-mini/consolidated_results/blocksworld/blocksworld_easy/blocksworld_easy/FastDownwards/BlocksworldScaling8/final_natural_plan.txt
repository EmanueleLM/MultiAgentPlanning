Plan (human-readable, matching the provided PDDL plan exactly)

Overview: total cost = 2 (each action unit cost = 1). We use discrete timestamps that correspond to stages s0→s1→s2:
- Action 1 executes from t=0 to t=1 (s0 → s1), duration = 1.
- Action 2 executes from t=1 to t=2 (s1 → s2), duration = 1.

Step 1
- Time: t = 0 → 1 (stage s0 to s1), duration = 1
- Action: pick-up blue
- PDDL call: (pick-up blue s0 s1)
- Preconditions checked before executing:
  - blue is on the table (ontable blue) — yes (initial).
  - blue is clear (nothing on top of it) — yes (initial).
  - hand is empty (handempty) — yes (initial).
- Effects applied by this action:
  - Agent is now holding blue (holding blue).
  - blue is no longer on the table (not ontable blue).
  - blue is not clear while held (not clear blue).
  - hand is no longer empty (not handempty).
  - stage advances: current s0 → current s1.
- State snapshot after step 1 (relevant facts):
  - holding(blue), not ontable(blue), not clear(blue), not handempty
  - yellow still on red (on yellow red), yellow clear, red ontable
  - blue and orange were initially clear; blue is now held (so not clear)

Step 2
- Time: t = 1 → 2 (stage s1 to s2), duration = 1
- Action: stack blue on yellow
- PDDL call: (stack-onto blue yellow s1 s2)
- Preconditions checked before executing:
  - Agent is holding blue (holding blue) — yes (from Step 1).
  - yellow is clear (clear yellow) — yes (initial, still true).
  - blue and yellow are distinct — yes.
- Effects applied by this action:
  - blue is placed on top of yellow (on blue yellow).
  - blue becomes clear (clear blue) after being placed.
  - yellow is no longer clear (not clear yellow).
  - blue is no longer on the table (not ontable blue) — still true.
  - agent stops holding blue (not holding blue).
  - hand becomes empty (handempty).
  - stage advances: current s1 → current s2.
- State snapshot after step 2 (relevant facts):
  - on(blue, yellow) — newly true
  - on(yellow, red) — true from initial state
  - handempty — true (agent’s hand is empty)
  - clear(blue) — true, clear(yellow) — false

Final check (at t = 2)
- Goal required: on blue yellow, and on yellow red.
- Both are satisfied:
  - on(blue, yellow) — achieved in Step 2
  - on(yellow, red) — was true in the initial state and remained true
- Final hand state: handempty (agent’s hand is empty)

No additional actions were added or removed; the above two steps correspond exactly to the provided plan.
