Plan summary: move red onto orange. Total cost = 2. Executed sequentially by a single hand. Each action duration = 1 time unit.

Initial relevant facts (from perception)
- (on red yellow)
- (on yellow blue)
- (ontable blue)
- (ontable orange)
- (clear red)
- (clear orange)
- (handempty)

Step 1 — unstack(red, yellow)
- Time: t = 0.0 → 1.0 (duration 1)
- Preconditions required at start:
  - (on red yellow)
  - (clear red)
  - (handempty)
  - red ≠ yellow
- Effects (immediately after action completes at t = 1.0):
  - Add: (holding red)
  - Add: (clear yellow)
  - Delete: (on red yellow)
  - Delete: (clear red)
  - Delete: (handempty)

Step 2 — stack(red, orange)
- Time: t = 1.0 → 2.0 (duration 1)
- Preconditions required at t = 1.0:
  - (holding red) — provided by Step 1 effects
  - (clear orange) — true in the initial state and not changed by Step 1
  - red ≠ orange
- Effects (immediately after action completes at t = 2.0):
  - Add: (on red orange)
  - Add: (handempty)
  - Add: (clear red)
  - Delete: (holding red)
  - Delete: (clear orange)

Final relevant facts after t = 2.0
- (on red orange) — global goal achieved
- (handempty)
- (clear red)
- (not (clear orange))
- The other initial relations that were not modified remain: (on yellow blue), (ontable blue), (ontable orange) (note: orange is still on the table only if it was initially; after stack it is supporting red, so orange is not clear but still on the table).

Audit note: Plan obeys single-hand constraints and action preconditions are satisfied by the initial facts and the effects of preceding steps. No additional actions are required.
