Below is a clear, step-by-step human-readable rendering of the provided plan. Each step matches exactly one action from the plan (no actions added or removed). I give a concise time interval (1 unit per action, consistent with the plan cost = 10), list the action and parameters, and state the key preconditions and effects in plain language.

Assumed timing: actions execute sequentially, each taking 1 time unit. Start time = 0.0.

1) Time 0.0 → 1.0
   Action: unstack(red, orange)  [stage s0 → s1]
   Preconditions (before action): red is on orange; red is clear; hand is empty.
   Effects (after action): agent is holding red; orange becomes clear; red is no longer on orange; hand is no longer empty; red is no longer clear.

2) Time 1.0 → 2.0
   Action: putdown(red)  [stage s1 → s2]
   Preconditions: agent is holding red.
   Effects: red is on the table; red becomes clear; hand becomes empty; agent no longer holding red.

3) Time 2.0 → 3.0
   Action: unstack(orange, blue)  [stage s2 → s3]
   Preconditions: orange is on blue; orange is clear; hand is empty.
   Effects: agent is holding orange; blue becomes clear; orange is no longer on blue; hand is no longer empty; orange is no longer clear.

4) Time 3.0 → 4.0
   Action: putdown(orange)  [stage s3 → s4]
   Preconditions: agent is holding orange.
   Effects: orange is on the table; orange becomes clear; hand becomes empty; agent no longer holding orange.

5) Time 4.0 → 5.0
   Action: unstack(blue, yellow)  [stage s4 → s5]
   Preconditions: blue is on yellow; blue is clear; hand is empty.
   Effects: agent is holding blue; yellow becomes clear; blue is no longer on yellow; hand is no longer empty; blue is no longer clear.

6) Time 5.0 → 6.0
   Action: putdown(blue)  [stage s5 → s6]
   Preconditions: agent is holding blue.
   Effects: blue is on the table; blue becomes clear; hand becomes empty; agent no longer holding blue.

7) Time 6.0 → 7.0
   Action: pickup(red)  [stage s6 → s7]
   Preconditions: red is on the table; red is clear; hand is empty.
   Effects: agent is holding red; red is no longer on the table; hand is no longer empty; red is no longer clear.

8) Time 7.0 → 8.0
   Action: stack(red, yellow)  [stage s7 → s8]
   Preconditions: agent is holding red; yellow is clear.
   Effects: red is on yellow; red becomes clear; hand becomes empty; agent no longer holding red; yellow is no longer clear.

9) Time 8.0 → 9.0
   Action: pickup(blue)  [stage s8 → s9]
   Preconditions: blue is on the table; blue is clear; hand is empty.
   Effects: agent is holding blue; blue is no longer on the table; hand is no longer empty; blue is no longer clear.

10) Time 9.0 → 10.0
    Action: stack(blue, red)  [stage s9 → s10]
    Preconditions: agent is holding blue; red is clear.
    Effects: blue is on red; blue becomes clear; hand becomes empty; agent no longer holding blue; red is no longer clear.

Final state after 10.0: The goal conditions are satisfied — red is on yellow, and blue is on red. Total cost (time units) = 10.
