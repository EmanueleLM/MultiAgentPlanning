Below is a step-by-step, human-readable trace of the given plan. Each step matches the plan exactly, reports the consumed stage (used as a timestamp), assumes a unit duration per action (stage i -> stage i+1), lists the action preconditions (state required just before the action) and the effects (state immediately after the action). I explicitly note when a step assumes the hand is empty and which clear predicates change.

Initial state (stage0):
- handempty(a1) = true
- ontable(yellow)
- on(blue, yellow)
- on(orange, blue)
- on(red, orange)
- clear(red) = true
- clear(orange) = false, clear(blue) = false, clear(yellow) = false
- current = stage0

Step 1 — unstack a1 red orange (stage0 -> stage1). Duration: 1 time unit.
- Action: a1 un-stacks red from on top of orange and holds red.
- Preconditions (before): on(red, orange), clear(red), handempty(a1), current = stage0, succ(stage0, stage1)
- Effects (after): 
  - Removed: on(red, orange), clear(red), handempty(a1)
  - Added: holding(a1, red), clear(orange), current = stage1
- Notes: Assumes hand was empty. Clearing: orange becomes clear (it has no block on it after red is removed). Red becomes not clear (domain models holding as not clear).

Step 2 — put_down a1 red (stage1 -> stage2). Duration: 1 time unit.
- Action: a1 puts the held red block down onto the table.
- Preconditions (before): holding(a1, red), current = stage1, succ(stage1, stage2)
- Effects (after):
  - Removed: holding(a1, red)
  - Added: handempty(a1), ontable(red), clear(red), current = stage2
- Notes: Hand becomes empty. Red is now on the table and clear.

Step 3 — unstack a1 orange blue (stage2 -> stage3). Duration: 1 time unit.
- Action: a1 un-stacks orange from on top of blue and holds orange.
- Preconditions (before): on(orange, blue), clear(orange), handempty(a1), current = stage2, succ(stage2, stage3)
- Effects (after):
  - Removed: on(orange, blue), clear(orange), handempty(a1)
  - Added: holding(a1, orange), clear(blue), current = stage3
- Notes: Assumes hand was empty. Clearing: blue becomes clear (orange removed from it). Orange becomes not clear while held.

Step 4 — stack a1 orange red (stage3 -> stage4). Duration: 1 time unit.
- Action: a1 stacks the held orange onto red.
- Preconditions (before): holding(a1, orange), clear(red), current = stage3, succ(stage3, stage4)
- Effects (after):
  - Removed: holding(a1, orange)
  - Added: handempty(a1), on(orange, red), clear(orange), (not clear(red)), current = stage4
- Notes: Orange is placed on red; red becomes not clear; orange becomes clear on top.

Step 5 — unstack a1 blue yellow (stage4 -> stage5). Duration: 1 time unit.
- Action: a1 un-stacks blue from on top of yellow and holds blue.
- Preconditions (before): on(blue, yellow), clear(blue), handempty(a1), current = stage4, succ(stage4, stage5)
- Effects (after):
  - Removed: on(blue, yellow), clear(blue), handempty(a1)
  - Added: holding(a1, blue), clear(yellow), current = stage5
- Notes: Assumes hand was empty. Clearing: yellow becomes clear when blue is removed.

Step 6 — put_down a1 blue (stage5 -> stage6). Duration: 1 time unit.
- Action: a1 puts the held blue block down onto the table.
- Preconditions (before): holding(a1, blue), current = stage5, succ(stage5, stage6)
- Effects (after):
  - Removed: holding(a1, blue)
  - Added: handempty(a1), ontable(blue), clear(blue), current = stage6
- Notes: Blue is now on the table and clear; hand is empty.

Step 7 — pick_up a1 yellow (stage6 -> stage7). Duration: 1 time unit.
- Action: a1 picks up yellow from the table and holds it.
- Preconditions (before): ontable(yellow), clear(yellow), handempty(a1), current = stage6, succ(stage6, stage7)
- Effects (after):
  - Removed: ontable(yellow), clear(yellow), handempty(a1)
  - Added: holding(a1, yellow), current = stage7
- Notes: Assumes hand was empty. Yellow becomes not clear while held.

Step 8 — stack a1 yellow orange (stage7 -> stage8). Duration: 1 time unit.
- Action: a1 stacks the held yellow onto orange.
- Preconditions (before): holding(a1, yellow), clear(orange), current = stage7, succ(stage7, stage8)
- Effects (after):
  - Removed: holding(a1, yellow)
  - Added: handempty(a1), on(yellow, orange), (not clear(orange)), clear(yellow), current = stage8
- Notes: Yellow placed on orange. Orange becomes not clear again; yellow is clear on top.

Step 9 — pick_up a1 blue (stage8 -> stage9). Duration: 1 time unit.
- Action: a1 picks up blue from the table and holds it.
- Preconditions (before): ontable(blue), clear(blue), handempty(a1), current = stage8, succ(stage8, stage9)
- Effects (after):
  - Removed: ontable(blue), clear(blue), handempty(a1)
  - Added: holding(a1, blue), current = stage9
- Notes: Assumes hand was empty. Blue becomes not clear while held.

Step 10 — stack a1 blue yellow (stage9 -> stage10). Duration: 1 time unit.
- Action: a1 stacks the held blue onto yellow.
- Preconditions (before): holding(a1, blue), clear(yellow), current = stage9, succ(stage9, stage10)
- Effects (after):
  - Removed: holding(a1, blue)
  - Added: handempty(a1), on(blue, yellow), (not clear(yellow)), clear(blue), current = stage10
- Notes: Blue placed on yellow; yellow becomes not clear; blue is clear on top. Hand becomes empty.

Final state (after stage10):
- on(blue, yellow) — goal satisfied
- on(yellow, orange) — goal satisfied
- on(orange, red) — goal satisfied
- ontable(red)
- ontable(blue) no longer true (blue is on yellow). The final ontable facts consistent with above.
- handempty(a1) = true
- current = stage10

Goal check:
- on(blue, yellow) — true
- on(orange, red) — true
- on(yellow, orange) — true

All three goal predicates are satisfied at stage10. The step sequence follows the single-hand constraint (each action that picks/un-stacks requires handempty; put/stack frees the hand), and all preconditions and effects reported above match the domain encoding and the given plan.
