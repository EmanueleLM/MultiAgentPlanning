Plan (10 steps). Each step shows the action, the timestamp (stage sN → sN+1), duration = 1 time unit, key preconditions and key effects. The sequence exactly matches the provided plan.

1) Time s0 → s1 (duration 1)
   Action: Unstack red from orange
   Preconditions: red is on orange; red is clear; hand is empty.
   Effects: you hold red; red is no longer on orange; orange becomes clear; hand is no longer empty.

2) Time s1 → s2 (duration 1)
   Action: Put down red (onto the table)
   Preconditions: holding red.
   Effects: red is on the table; red becomes clear; you are no longer holding red; hand becomes empty.

3) Time s2 → s3 (duration 1)
   Action: Unstack yellow from blue
   Preconditions: yellow is on blue; yellow is clear; hand is empty.
   Effects: you hold yellow; yellow is no longer on blue; blue becomes clear; hand is no longer empty.

4) Time s3 → s4 (duration 1)
   Action: Put down yellow (onto the table)
   Preconditions: holding yellow.
   Effects: yellow is on the table; yellow becomes clear; you are no longer holding yellow; hand becomes empty.

5) Time s4 → s5 (duration 1)
   Action: Pick up orange (from the table)
   Preconditions: orange is on the table; orange is clear; hand is empty.
   Effects: you hold orange; orange is no longer on the table; orange is no longer clear; hand is no longer empty.

6) Time s5 → s6 (duration 1)
   Action: Stack orange onto yellow
   Preconditions: holding orange; yellow is clear.
   Effects: orange is on yellow; orange becomes clear; yellow is no longer clear; you are no longer holding orange; hand becomes empty.

7) Time s6 → s7 (duration 1)
   Action: Pick up blue (from the table)
   Preconditions: blue is on the table; blue is clear; hand is empty.
   Effects: you hold blue; blue is no longer on the table; blue is no longer clear; hand is no longer empty.

8) Time s7 → s8 (duration 1)
   Action: Stack blue onto orange
   Preconditions: holding blue; orange is clear.
   Effects: blue is on orange; blue becomes clear; orange is no longer clear; you are no longer holding blue; hand becomes empty.

9) Time s8 → s9 (duration 1)
   Action: Pick up red (from the table)
   Preconditions: red is on the table; red is clear; hand is empty.
   Effects: you hold red; red is no longer on the table; red is no longer clear; hand is no longer empty.

10) Time s9 → s10 (duration 1)
    Action: Stack red onto blue
    Preconditions: holding red; blue is clear.
    Effects: red is on blue; red becomes clear; blue is no longer clear; you are no longer holding red; hand becomes empty.

Final state at time s10 (after step 10):
- red on blue
- blue on orange
- orange on yellow
- yellow on the table
- hand is empty
This satisfies the goal (red on blue, blue on orange, orange on yellow) at stage s10.
