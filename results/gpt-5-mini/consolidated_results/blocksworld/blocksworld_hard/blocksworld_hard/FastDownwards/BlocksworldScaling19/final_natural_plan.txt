Plan (one action per step; timestamps correspond to steps s0 → s10; each action advances current step by one; each action duration = 1 time unit):

1) s0 → s1 — unstack blue orange
   - Action: unstack(blue, orange)
   - Preconditions (at s0): current s0; blue is on orange; blue is clear; hand empty; blue ≠ orange
   - Effects (applied at s1): blue is no longer on orange; blue is held; blue is no longer clear; hand is no longer empty; orange becomes clear
   - Purpose: remove blue from top of orange so orange becomes free and blue is in hand.

2) s1 → s2 — putdown blue
   - Action: putdown(blue)
   - Preconditions (at s1): current s1; holding blue
   - Effects (applied at s2): blue is placed on the table (on-table blue); blue becomes clear; blue is no longer held; hand becomes empty
   - Purpose: put blue on the table so other moves involving orange/red can proceed.

3) s2 → s3 — unstack orange red
   - Action: unstack(orange, red)
   - Preconditions (at s2): current s2; orange is on red; orange is clear; hand empty; orange ≠ red
   - Effects (applied at s3): orange is no longer on red; orange is held; orange is no longer clear; hand is not empty; red becomes clear
   - Purpose: take orange off red to free red for later reconfiguration.

4) s3 → s4 — putdown orange
   - Action: putdown(orange)
   - Preconditions (at s3): current s3; holding orange
   - Effects (applied at s4): orange is placed on the table (on-table orange); orange becomes clear; orange is no longer held; hand becomes empty
   - Purpose: put orange on the table to make red fully accessible.

5) s4 → s5 — pickup red
   - Action: pickup(red)
   - Preconditions (at s4): current s4; red is on-table; red is clear; hand empty
   - Effects (applied at s5): red is no longer on the table; red is held; red is no longer clear; hand is not empty
   - Purpose: pick up red so it can be placed on top of blue (goal requires red on blue).

6) s5 → s6 — stack red blue
   - Action: stack(red, blue)
   - Preconditions (at s5): current s5; holding red; blue is clear; red ≠ blue
   - Effects (applied at s6): red is placed on blue (on red blue); red is no longer held; blue becomes not clear; red becomes clear; hand becomes empty; red is not on-table
   - Purpose: put red on top of blue (achieves part of the goal: on red blue).

7) s6 → s7 — pickup orange
   - Action: pickup(orange)
   - Preconditions (at s6): current s6; orange is on-table; orange is clear; hand empty
   - Effects (applied at s7): orange is no longer on-table; orange is held; orange is no longer clear; hand is not empty
   - Purpose: pick orange up so it can be stacked on red.

8) s7 → s8 — stack orange red
   - Action: stack(orange, red)
   - Preconditions (at s7): current s7; holding orange; red is clear; orange ≠ red
   - Effects (applied at s8): orange is placed on red (on orange red); orange is no longer held; red becomes not clear; orange becomes clear; hand becomes empty; orange is not on-table
   - Purpose: place orange on red (achieves part of the goal: on orange red).

9) s8 → s9 — pickup yellow
   - Action: pickup(yellow)
   - Preconditions (at s8): current s8; yellow is on-table; yellow is clear; hand empty
   - Effects (applied at s9): yellow is no longer on-table; yellow is held; yellow is no longer clear; hand is not empty
   - Purpose: prepare yellow to be stacked on orange.

10) s9 → s10 — stack yellow orange
    - Action: stack(yellow, orange)
    - Preconditions (at s9): current s9; holding yellow; orange is clear; yellow ≠ orange
    - Effects (applied at s10): yellow is placed on orange (on yellow orange); yellow is no longer held; orange becomes not clear; yellow becomes clear; hand becomes empty; yellow is not on-table
    - Purpose: place yellow on orange (achieves final part of the goal: on yellow orange).

Final state (at s10):
- on red blue (established at step 6)
- on orange red (established at step 8)
- on yellow orange (established at step 10)
These match the goal: red on blue; orange on red; yellow on orange.

Total cost: 10 actions (unit cost each) = cost 10.
