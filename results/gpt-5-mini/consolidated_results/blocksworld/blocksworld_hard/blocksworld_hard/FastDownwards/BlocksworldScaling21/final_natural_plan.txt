Plan (timestamps in time units; each action duration = 1 unit; start at t=0):

1) t=0 → t=1 (dur=1) — unstack red from blue
   - Preconditions satisfied: red is on blue, red is clear, hand empty.
   - Effects: remove (on red blue); holding red; red no longer clear; blue becomes clear; hand is not empty.

2) t=1 → t=2 (dur=1) — putdown red
   - Preconditions satisfied: holding red.
   - Effects: place red on table (ontable red); remove holding red; red becomes clear; hand becomes empty.

3) t=2 → t=3 (dur=1) — unstack blue from orange
   - Preconditions satisfied: blue is on orange, blue is clear, hand empty.
   - Effects: remove (on blue orange); holding blue; blue no longer clear; orange becomes clear; hand not empty.

4) t=3 → t=4 (dur=1) — putdown blue
   - Preconditions satisfied: holding blue.
   - Effects: place blue on table (ontable blue); remove holding blue; blue becomes clear; hand becomes empty.

5) t=4 → t=5 (dur=1) — unstack orange from yellow
   - Preconditions satisfied: orange is on yellow, orange is clear, hand empty.
   - Effects: remove (on orange yellow); holding orange; orange no longer clear; yellow becomes clear; hand not empty.

6) t=5 → t=6 (dur=1) — putdown orange
   - Preconditions satisfied: holding orange.
   - Effects: place orange on table (ontable orange); remove holding orange; orange becomes clear; hand becomes empty.

7) t=6 → t=7 (dur=1) — pickup yellow
   - Preconditions satisfied: yellow is on the table, yellow is clear, hand empty.
   - Effects: remove (ontable yellow); holding yellow; yellow no longer clear; hand not empty.

8) t=7 → t=8 (dur=1) — stack yellow on red
   - Preconditions satisfied: holding yellow, red is clear.
   - Effects: place (on yellow red); remove holding yellow; yellow becomes clear; red becomes not clear; hand becomes empty.

9) t=8 → t=9 (dur=1) — pickup orange
   - Preconditions satisfied: orange is on the table, orange is clear, hand empty.
   - Effects: remove (ontable orange); holding orange; orange no longer clear; hand not empty.

10) t=9 → t=10 (dur=1) — stack orange on yellow
    - Preconditions satisfied: holding orange, yellow is clear.
    - Effects: place (on orange yellow); remove holding orange; orange becomes clear; yellow becomes not clear; hand becomes empty.

11) t=10 → t=11 (dur=1) — pickup blue
    - Preconditions satisfied: blue is on the table, blue is clear, hand empty.
    - Effects: remove (ontable blue); holding blue; blue no longer clear; hand not empty.

12) t=11 → t=12 (dur=1) — stack blue on orange
    - Preconditions satisfied: holding blue, orange is clear.
    - Effects: place (on blue orange); remove holding blue; blue becomes clear; orange becomes not clear; hand becomes empty.

Final state at t=12 (goal check):
- on blue orange — satisfied
- on orange yellow — satisfied
- on yellow red — satisfied
- hand is empty.

Total cost (sum of unit durations) = 12. The sequence exactly follows the given plan and respects single-hand and clear preconditions at each step.
