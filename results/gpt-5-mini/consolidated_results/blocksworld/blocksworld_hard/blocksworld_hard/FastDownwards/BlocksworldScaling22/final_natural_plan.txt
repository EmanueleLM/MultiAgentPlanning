1) Time s0 -> s1 — unstack orange from yellow
- Action: unstack(orange, yellow)
- Preconditions checked: orange is on yellow; orange is clear; hand is empty; current stage = s0.
- Effects: agent picks up orange (holding orange); orange is no longer on yellow; yellow becomes clear; orange is no longer clear (it is held); hand is no longer empty; current stage becomes s1.

2) Time s1 -> s2 — put down orange on the table
- Action: putdown(orange)
- Preconditions checked: holding orange; current stage = s1.
- Effects: orange is on the table (ontable orange); orange becomes clear; hand becomes empty; agent is not holding orange; current stage becomes s2.

3) Time s2 -> s3 — unstack yellow from red
- Action: unstack(yellow, red)
- Preconditions checked: yellow is on red; yellow is clear; hand is empty; current stage = s2.
- Effects: agent picks up yellow (holding yellow); yellow is no longer on red; red becomes clear; yellow is no longer clear (it is held); hand is no longer empty; current stage becomes s3.

4) Time s3 -> s4 — put down yellow on the table
- Action: putdown(yellow)
- Preconditions checked: holding yellow; current stage = s3.
- Effects: yellow is on the table (ontable yellow); yellow becomes clear; hand becomes empty; agent is not holding yellow; current stage becomes s4.

5) Time s4 -> s5 — unstack red from blue
- Action: unstack(red, blue)
- Preconditions checked: red is on blue; red is clear; hand is empty; current stage = s4.
- Effects: agent picks up red (holding red); red is no longer on blue; blue becomes clear; red is no longer clear (it is held); hand is no longer empty; current stage becomes s5.

6) Time s5 -> s6 — put down red on the table
- Action: putdown(red)
- Preconditions checked: holding red; current stage = s5.
- Effects: red is on the table (ontable red); red becomes clear; hand becomes empty; agent is not holding red; current stage becomes s6.

7) Time s6 -> s7 — pick up yellow from the table
- Action: pickup(yellow)
- Preconditions checked: yellow is on the table; yellow is clear; hand is empty; current stage = s6.
- Effects: agent picks up yellow (holding yellow); yellow is no longer on the table; yellow is no longer clear (it is held); hand is no longer empty; current stage becomes s7.

8) Time s7 -> s8 — stack yellow onto blue
- Action: stack(yellow, blue)
- Preconditions checked: holding yellow; blue is clear; current stage = s7.
- Effects: yellow is on blue (on yellow blue); yellow becomes clear; blue is no longer clear; hand becomes empty; agent is not holding yellow; yellow is no longer on the table; current stage becomes s8.

9) Time s8 -> s9 — pick up orange from the table
- Action: pickup(orange)
- Preconditions checked: orange is on the table; orange is clear; hand is empty; current stage = s8.
- Effects: agent picks up orange (holding orange); orange is no longer on the table; orange is no longer clear (it is held); hand is no longer empty; current stage becomes s9.

10) Time s9 -> s10 — stack orange onto yellow
- Action: stack(orange, yellow)
- Preconditions checked: holding orange; yellow is clear; current stage = s9.
- Effects: orange is on yellow (on orange yellow); orange becomes clear; yellow is no longer clear; hand becomes empty; agent is not holding orange; orange is no longer on the table; current stage becomes s10.

11) Time s10 -> s11 — pick up red from the table
- Action: pickup(red)
- Preconditions checked: red is on the table; red is clear; hand is empty; current stage = s10.
- Effects: agent picks up red (holding red); red is no longer on the table; red is no longer clear (it is held); hand is no longer empty; current stage becomes s11.

12) Time s11 -> s12 — stack red onto orange
- Action: stack(red, orange)
- Preconditions checked: holding red; orange is clear; current stage = s11.
- Effects: red is on orange (on red orange); red becomes clear; orange is no longer clear; hand becomes empty; agent is not holding red; red is no longer on the table; current stage becomes s12.

Summary and final verification:
- Total plan cost (unit cost per action): 12.
- Final topologies: red on orange, orange on yellow, yellow on blue — this satisfies the goal: (on red orange) AND (on orange yellow) AND (on yellow blue).
- All steps respect the single-hand constraint and require appropriate preconditions (clear, ontable/on, handempty, or holding) before each action.
