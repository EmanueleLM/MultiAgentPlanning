Initial situation (time s0): tower top-to-bottom = orange on blue on yellow on red on table; only orange is clear; orchestrator’s hand is empty. Each action advances the current stage by one successor (s0→s1 is one time unit, s1→s2 next, etc.). Below are the steps exactly as in the plan, with timestamps, short descriptions, and the main resulting facts after each step.

1) Time s0 → s1 (t = 0..1) — unstack orchestrator orange from blue
   - Description: Orchestrator unstack(s) orange off of blue into its hand.
   - Key effects after action: orchestrator is holding orange; orange is no longer on blue or on the table and is not clear; blue becomes clear; hand is not empty; current stage = s1.

2) Time s1 → s2 (t = 1..2) — putdown orchestrator orange
   - Description: Orchestrator puts the held orange down onto the table.
   - Key effects after action: orange is on the table and clear; orchestrator’s hand becomes empty; orchestrator no longer holds orange; current stage = s2.

3) Time s2 → s3 (t = 2..3) — unstack orchestrator blue from yellow
   - Description: Orchestrator unstack(s) blue off of yellow into its hand.
   - Key effects after action: orchestrator is holding blue; blue is no longer on yellow or on the table and is not clear; yellow becomes clear; hand is not empty; current stage = s3.

4) Time s3 → s4 (t = 3..4) — stack orchestrator blue onto orange
   - Description: Orchestrator stacks the held blue onto the clear orange.
   - Key effects after action: blue is on orange; blue is not on the table and becomes clear; orange is no longer clear; orchestrator’s hand becomes empty; orchestrator no longer holds blue; current stage = s4.

5) Time s4 → s5 (t = 4..5) — unstack orchestrator yellow from red
   - Description: Orchestrator unstack(s) yellow off of red into its hand.
   - Key effects after action: orchestrator is holding yellow; yellow is no longer on red or on the table and is not clear; red becomes clear; hand is not empty; current stage = s5.

6) Time s5 → s6 (t = 5..6) — putdown orchestrator yellow
   - Description: Orchestrator puts the held yellow down onto the table.
   - Key effects after action: yellow is on the table and clear; orchestrator’s hand becomes empty; orchestrator no longer holds yellow; current stage = s6.

7) Time s6 → s7 (t = 6..7) — pickup orchestrator red
   - Description: Orchestrator picks up red from the table into its hand.
   - Key effects after action: orchestrator is holding red; red is not on the table and not clear; hand is not empty; current stage = s7.

8) Time s7 → s8 (t = 7..8) — stack orchestrator red onto yellow
   - Description: Orchestrator stacks the held red onto the clear yellow.
   - Key effects after action: red is on yellow; red is not on the table and becomes clear; yellow is no longer clear; orchestrator’s hand becomes empty; orchestrator no longer holds red; current stage = s8.
   - Note: This achieves (on red yellow).

9) Time s8 → s9 (t = 8..9) — unstack orchestrator blue from orange
   - Description: Orchestrator unstack(s) blue off of orange into its hand.
   - Key effects after action: orchestrator is holding blue; blue is no longer on orange or on the table and is not clear; orange becomes clear; hand is not empty; current stage = s9.

10) Time s9 → s10 (t = 9..10) — putdown orchestrator blue
    - Description: Orchestrator puts the held blue down onto the table.
    - Key effects after action: blue is on the table and clear; orchestrator’s hand becomes empty; orchestrator no longer holds blue; current stage = s10.

11) Time s10 → s11 (t = 10..11) — pickup orchestrator orange
    - Description: Orchestrator picks up orange from the table into its hand.
    - Key effects after action: orchestrator is holding orange; orange is not on the table and not clear; hand is not empty; current stage = s11.

12) Time s11 → s12 (t = 11..12) — stack orchestrator orange onto red
    - Description: Orchestrator stacks the held orange onto the red.
    - Key effects after action: orange is on red; orange is not on the table and becomes clear; red is no longer clear; orchestrator’s hand becomes empty; orchestrator no longer holds orange; current stage = s12.
    - Note: This achieves (on orange red).

13) Time s12 → s13 (t = 12..13) — pickup orchestrator blue
    - Description: Orchestrator picks up blue from the table into its hand.
    - Key effects after action: orchestrator is holding blue; blue is not on the table and not clear; hand is not empty; current stage = s13.

14) Time s13 → s14 (t = 13..14) — stack orchestrator blue onto orange
    - Description: Orchestrator stacks the held blue onto the orange.
    - Key effects after action: blue is on orange; blue is not on the table and becomes clear; orange is no longer clear; orchestrator’s hand becomes empty; orchestrator no longer holds blue; current stage = s14.
    - Note: This achieves (on blue orange).

Final status (time s14): The goal is satisfied:
 - on red yellow (achieved at step 8)
 - on orange red (achieved at step 12)
 - on blue orange (achieved at step 14)

Total actions: 14. Total time units (stages advanced): 14 (s0 → s14). Cost (unit per action) = 14.
