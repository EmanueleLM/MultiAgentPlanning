Plan (each action takes 1 time unit; stages s0→s12 correspond to times 0→12):

1. Time 0 → 1 (s0 → s1): Unstack orange from on top of yellow.
   - Result: holding(orange); yellow becomes clear.

2. Time 1 → 2 (s1 → s2): Put down orange onto the table.
   - Result: orange is on the table and clear; hand becomes empty.

3. Time 2 → 3 (s2 → s3): Unstack yellow from on top of blue.
   - Result: holding(yellow); blue becomes clear.

4. Time 3 → 4 (s3 → s4): Put down yellow onto the table.
   - Result: yellow is on the table and clear; hand becomes empty.

5. Time 4 → 5 (s4 → s5): Unstack blue from on top of red.
   - Result: holding(blue); red becomes clear.

6. Time 5 → 6 (s5 → s6): Put down blue onto the table.
   - Result: blue is on the table and clear; hand becomes empty.

7. Time 6 → 7 (s6 → s7): Pick up orange from the table.
   - Result: holding(orange); orange is no longer on the table; hand is not empty.

8. Time 7 → 8 (s7 → s8): Stack orange onto red.
   - Result: orange is on red; orange becomes clear; red is no longer clear; hand becomes empty.

9. Time 8 → 9 (s8 → s9): Pick up yellow from the table.
   - Result: holding(yellow); yellow is no longer on the table; hand is not empty.

10. Time 9 → 10 (s9 → s10): Stack yellow onto orange.
    - Result: yellow is on orange; yellow becomes clear; orange is no longer clear; hand becomes empty.

11. Time 10 → 11 (s10 → s11): Pick up blue from the table.
    - Result: holding(blue); blue is no longer on the table; hand is not empty.

12. Time 11 → 12 (s11 → s12): Stack blue onto yellow.
    - Result: blue is on yellow; blue becomes clear; yellow is no longer clear; hand becomes empty.

Total plan cost (unit cost per action): 12.

Final achieved configuration (goal):
- blue on yellow
- orange on red
- yellow on orange
