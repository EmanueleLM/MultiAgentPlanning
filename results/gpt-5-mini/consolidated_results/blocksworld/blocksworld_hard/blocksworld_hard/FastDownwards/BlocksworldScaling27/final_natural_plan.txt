Plan summary: each action takes 1 time unit. Stages s0..s16 map to times t0..t16 where an action (sN -> sN+1) runs from tN to tN+1. The agent that executes each step is shown. Preconditions (brief) and explicit effects (brief) are reported for each step, matching the PDDL plan exactly.

1) Time t0 → t1 — block_picker-unstack(blue, red)  
   - Agent: block_picker  
   - Preconditions: current s0, next s0→s1, hand empty, blue is clear, blue is on red.  
   - Action: unstack blue from red (pick blue up from on(blue,red)).  
   - Effects: holding(blue); not handempty; not clear(blue); not on(blue,red); clear(red); current becomes s1.

   - Preconditions: current s8, next s8→s9, hand empty, red is clear, red is on the table.  
   - Action: pick up red from the table.  
   - Effects: holding(red); not handempty; not clear(red); not ontable(red); current becomes s9.

10) Time t9 → t10 — stack_manager-stack(red, orange)

    - Preconditions: current s9, next s9→s10, holding(red), orange is clear, red ≠ orange.  
    - Action: stack red onto orange.  
    - Effects: on(red,orange); clear(red); handempty; not holding(red); not clear(orange); not ontable(red); current becomes s10.

    - Agent: block_picker  
    - Preconditions: current s10, next s10→s11, hand empty, blue is clear, blue is on yellow.  
    - Action: unstack blue from yellow (pick blue up).  
    - Effects: holding(blue); not handempty; not clear(blue); not on(blue,yellow); clear(yellow); current becomes s11.

12) Time t11 → t12 — stack_manager-putdown(blue)  
    - Agent: stack_manager  
    - Preconditions: current s11, next s11→s12, holding(blue).  
    - Action: put down blue onto the table.  
    - Effects: ontable(blue); clear(blue); handempty; not holding(blue); current becomes s12.

13) Time t12 → t13 — block_picker-pickup(yellow)  
    - Agent: block_picker  
    - Preconditions: current s12, next s12→s13, hand empty, yellow is clear, yellow is on the table.  
    - Action: pick up yellow from the table.  
    - Effects: holding(yellow); not handempty; not clear(yellow); not ontable(yellow); current becomes s13.

14) Time t13 → t14 — stack_manager-stack(yellow, red)  
    - Agent: stack_manager  
    - Preconditions: current s13, next s13→s14, holding(yellow), red is clear, yellow ≠ red.

Outcome (after t16): goal satisfied exactly as required by the specification:
 - on(red, orange) — achieved at step 10  
 - on(blue, yellow) — achieved at step 16 (and transiently at step 8 before unstacking)  
 - on(yellow, red) — achieved at step 14

Total cost: 16 (16 unit-duration actions).
