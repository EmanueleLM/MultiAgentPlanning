Here is a clear, step-by-step, human-readable trace of the provided plan. I map stages s0..s12 to consecutive time points t0..t12 and show each action as occurring from tN to tN+1 (duration 1 time unit), matching the plan exactly.

1. Time t0 -> t1 (duration 1): Unstack red from yellow
   - Action: unstack(red, yellow)
   - Effect (immediately after): holding(red); yellow becomes clear; red is no longer on yellow; hand is not empty.

2. Time t1 -> t2 (duration 1): Put down red on the table
   - Action: putdown(red)
   - Effect: red is on the table (ontable); red becomes clear; hand becomes empty; no longer holding red.

3. Time t2 -> t3 (duration 1): Unstack yellow from blue
   - Action: unstack(yellow, blue)
   - Effect: holding(yellow); blue becomes clear; yellow is no longer on blue; hand is not empty.

4. Time t3 -> t4 (duration 1): Put down yellow on the table
   - Action: putdown(yellow)
   - Effect: yellow is on the table (ontable); yellow becomes clear; hand becomes empty; no longer holding yellow.

5. Time t4 -> t5 (duration 1): Unstack blue from orange
   - Action: unstack(blue, orange)
   - Effect: holding(blue); orange becomes clear; blue is no longer on orange; hand is not empty.

6. Time t5 -> t6 (duration 1): Put down blue on the table
   - Action: putdown(blue)
   - Effect: blue is on the table (ontable); blue becomes clear; hand becomes empty; no longer holding blue.

7. Time t6 -> t7 (duration 1): Pick up orange from the table
   - Action: pickup(orange)
   - Precondition: orange is on the table and clear and hand is empty
   - Effect: holding(orange); orange no longer on table; hand becomes not empty.

8. Time t7 -> t8 (duration 1): Stack orange onto blue
   - Action: stack(orange, blue)
   - Precondition: holding(orange) and blue is clear
   - Effect: orange is on blue; orange becomes clear; blue is no longer clear; hand becomes empty; no longer holding orange.

9. Time t8 -> t9 (duration 1): Pick up red from the table
   - Action: pickup(red)
   - Precondition: red is on the table and clear and hand is empty
   - Effect: holding(red); red no longer on table; hand becomes not empty.

10. Time t9 -> t10 (duration 1): Stack red onto orange
    - Action: stack(red, orange)
    - Precondition: holding(red) and orange is clear
    - Effect: red is on orange; red becomes clear; orange is no longer clear; hand becomes empty; no longer holding red.

11. Time t10 -> t11 (duration 1): Pick up yellow from the table
    - Action: pickup(yellow)
    - Precondition: yellow is on the table and clear and hand is empty
    - Effect: holding(yellow); yellow no longer on table; hand becomes not empty.

12. Time t11 -> t12 (duration 1): Stack yellow onto red
    - Action: stack(yellow, red)
    - Precondition: holding(yellow) and red is clear
    - Effect: yellow is on red; yellow becomes clear; red is no longer clear; hand becomes empty; no longer holding yellow.

Final state at t12 (goal achieved):
- red on orange
- orange on blue
- yellow on red

Total cost/time: 12 actions, each 1 time unit → total 12 time units (unit cost = 12).
