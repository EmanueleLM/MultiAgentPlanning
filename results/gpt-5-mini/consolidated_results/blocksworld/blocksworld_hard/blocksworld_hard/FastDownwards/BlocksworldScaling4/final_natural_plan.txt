Plan (each primitive action = 1 time unit). Stages s0..s10 map to timestamps t0..t10 (t0 = 0.0). Total cost = 10, total duration = 10 time units.

1) t0.0 → t1.0 : unstack(yellow, blue)  (unstack yellow from blue) — corresponds to (unstack yellow blue s0 s1)
   - Preconditions (checked at t0.0): yellow is on blue; yellow is clear; hand is empty.
   - Effects (at t1.0): agent is holding yellow; yellow is no longer on blue; blue becomes clear; hand is not empty; yellow is not clear while held.

2) t1.0 → t2.0 : putdown(yellow)  (put yellow down on the table) — (putdown yellow s1 s2)
   - Preconditions (t1.0): holding yellow.
   - Effects (t2.0): yellow is on the table; yellow is clear; hand becomes empty; agent no longer holding yellow.

3) t2.0 → t3.0 : unstack(blue, red)  (unstack blue from red) — (unstack blue red s2 s3)
   - Preconditions (t2.0): blue is on red; blue is clear; hand is empty.
   - Effects (t3.0): holding blue; blue is no longer on red; red becomes clear; hand is not empty; blue is not clear while held.

4) t3.0 → t4.0 : putdown(blue)  (put blue down on the table) — (putdown blue s3 s4)
   - Preconditions (t3.0): holding blue.
   - Effects (t4.0): blue is on the table; blue is clear; hand becomes empty; not holding blue.

5) t4.0 → t5.0 : unstack(red, orange)  (unstack red from orange) — (unstack red orange s4 s5)
   - Preconditions (t4.0): red is on orange; red is clear; hand is empty.
   - Effects (t5.0): holding red; red is no longer on orange; orange becomes clear; hand is not empty; red is not clear while held.

6) t5.0 → t6.0 : putdown(red)  (put red down on the table) — (putdown red s5 s6)
   - Preconditions (t5.0): holding red.
   - Effects (t6.0): red is on the table; red is clear; hand becomes empty; not holding red.

7) t6.0 → t7.0 : pickup(orange)  (pick up orange from the table) — (pickup orange s6 s7)
   - Preconditions (t6.0): orange is on the table; orange is clear; hand is empty.
   - Effects (t7.0): holding orange; orange is no longer on the table; orange is not clear while held; hand is not empty.

8) t7.0 → t8.0 : stack(orange, yellow)  (place orange on top of yellow) — (stack orange yellow s7 s8)
   - Preconditions (t7.0): holding orange; yellow is clear.
   - Effects (t8.0): orange is on yellow; orange is clear; yellow ceases to be clear; hand becomes empty; not holding orange.

9) t8.0 → t9.0 : pickup(blue)  (pick up blue from the table) — (pickup blue s8 s9)
   - Preconditions (t8.0): blue is on the table; blue is clear; hand is empty.
   - Effects (t9.0): holding blue; blue is no longer on the table; blue is not clear while held; hand is not empty.

10) t9.0 → t10.0 : stack(blue, orange)  (place blue on top of orange) — (stack blue orange s9 s10)
    - Preconditions (t9.0): holding blue; orange is clear.
    - Effects (t10.0): blue is on orange; blue is clear; orange ceases to be clear; hand becomes empty; not holding blue.

Goal check at t10.0: (on blue orange) and (on orange yellow) — both achieved.
