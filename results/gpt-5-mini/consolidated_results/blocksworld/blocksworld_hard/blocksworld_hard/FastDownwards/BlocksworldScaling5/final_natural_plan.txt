Step 1 — pick-up(orange)  
- Time: start 0.0s — end 1.0s (duration 1.0s)  
- Action performed: pick up the block "orange" from the table into the robot's hand.  
- Why this is applicable now: at the start (stage s0) the hand is empty, orange is on the table (ontable orange) and orange is clear (no block on top), and the plan advances stage s0 → s1.  
- State changes produced: orange is no longer on the table, orange becomes held (holding orange), the hand is no longer empty, and the global stage advances to s1.

Step 2 — stack(orange onto red)  
- Time: start 1.0s — end 2.0s (duration 1.0s)  
- Action performed: place the held block "orange" on top of block "red" (stack orange on red).  
- Why this is applicable now: at stage s1 the agent is holding orange, red is clear (no block on top), the stage successor s1 → s2 is available, and red is not on top of orange (no immediate 2‑cycle).  
- State changes produced: orange is no longer held and is now on red (on orange red), orange is not on the table, red is no longer clear, the hand becomes empty, and the global stage advances to s2.

Summary / Goal check:  
- After these two sequential actions (cost = 2 unit steps), the final facts include: on blue yellow (unchanged from the initial state) and on orange red (established by Step 2). These satisfy the stated goal (on blue yellow) AND (on orange red).
