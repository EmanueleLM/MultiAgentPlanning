Summary of plan (12 ordered steps). Each step follows the given PDDL plan exactly. Timestamps use the stage transition shown in the plan (sX -> sY). Each step lists (1) the action, (2) the timestamp (sX→sY), (3) required preconditions at execution time, and (4) explicit effects (facts removed and facts added). Where relevant, hand bookkeeping (holding / handempty) is made explicit. Duration: each stage transition is one unit (unit cost) so each step is 1 time unit.

Initial facts (time s0):
- (on red yellow)
- (on orange blue)
- (ontable blue)
- (ontable yellow)
- (clear red)
- (clear orange)
- (handempty)

Step 1
- Action: unstack red from yellow
- Plan entry: (unstack red yellow s0 s1)
- Timestamp: s0 → s1 (duration 1)
- Preconditions (must hold at s0): (on red yellow), (clear red), (handempty)
- Effects (applied at transition s1):
  - Deleted: (on red yellow), (clear red), (handempty)
  - Added: (holding red), (clear yellow)
- Resulting hand state after step: holding(red) (hand is not empty)

Step 2
- Action: putdown red (onto table)
- Plan entry: (putdown red s1 s2)
- Timestamp: s1 → s2 (duration 1)
- Preconditions (must hold at s1): (holding red)
- Effects (applied at s2):
  - Deleted: (holding red)
  - Added: (ontable red), (clear red), (handempty)
- Resulting hand state after step: handempty

Step 3
- Action: pickup yellow (from table)
- Plan entry: (pickup yellow s2 s3)
- Timestamp: s2 → s3 (duration 1)
- Preconditions (must hold at s2): (ontable yellow), (clear yellow), (handempty)
- Effects (applied at s3):
  - Deleted: (ontable yellow), (clear yellow), (handempty)
  - Added: (holding yellow)
- Resulting hand state after step: holding(yellow)

Step 4
- Action: putdown yellow (onto table)
- Plan entry: (putdown yellow s3 s4)
- Timestamp: s3 → s4 (duration 1)
- Preconditions (must hold at s3): (holding yellow)
- Effects (applied at s4):
  - Deleted: (holding yellow)
  - Added: (ontable yellow), (clear yellow), (handempty)
- Resulting hand state after step: handempty

Step 5
- Action: unstack orange from blue
- Plan entry: (unstack orange blue s4 s5)
- Timestamp: s4 → s5 (duration 1)
- Preconditions (must hold at s4): (on orange blue), (clear orange), (handempty)
- Effects (applied at s5):
  - Deleted: (on orange blue), (clear orange), (handempty)
  - Added: (holding orange), (clear blue)
- Resulting hand state after step: holding(orange)

Step 6
- Action: putdown orange (onto table)
- Plan entry: (putdown orange s5 s6)
- Timestamp: s5 → s6 (duration 1)
- Preconditions (must hold at s5): (holding orange)
- Effects (applied at s6):
  - Deleted: (holding orange)
  - Added: (ontable orange), (clear orange), (handempty)
- Resulting hand state after step: handempty

Step 7
- Action: pickup blue (from table)
- Plan entry: (pickup blue s6 s7)
- Timestamp: s6 → s7 (duration 1)
- Preconditions (must hold at s6): (ontable blue), (clear blue), (handempty)
- Effects (applied at s7):
  - Deleted: (ontable blue), (clear blue), (handempty)
  - Added: (holding blue)
- Resulting hand state after step: holding(blue)

Step 8
- Action: stack blue onto red
- Plan entry: (stack blue red s7 s8)
- Timestamp: s7 → s8 (duration 1)
- Preconditions (must hold at s7): (holding blue), (clear red)
- Effects (applied at s8):
  - Deleted: (holding blue), (clear red)
  - Added: (on blue red), (clear blue), (handempty)
- Resulting hand state after step: handempty

Step 9
- Action: pickup orange (from table)
- Plan entry: (pickup orange s8 s9)
- Timestamp: s8 → s9 (duration 1)
- Preconditions (must hold at s8): (ontable orange), (clear orange), (handempty)
- Effects (applied at s9):
  - Deleted: (ontable orange), (clear orange), (handempty)
  - Added: (holding orange)
- Resulting hand state after step: holding(orange)

Step 10
- Action: stack orange onto blue
- Plan entry: (stack orange blue s9 s10)
- Timestamp: s9 → s10 (duration 1)
- Preconditions (must hold at s9): (holding orange), (clear blue)
- Effects (applied at s10):
  - Deleted: (holding orange), (clear blue)
  - Added: (on orange blue), (clear orange), (handempty)
- Resulting hand state after step: handempty

Step 11
- Action: pickup yellow (from table)
- Plan entry: (pickup yellow s10 s11)
- Timestamp: s10 → s11 (duration 1)
- Preconditions (must hold at s10): (ontable yellow), (clear yellow), (handempty)
- Effects (applied at s11):
  - Deleted: (ontable yellow), (clear yellow), (handempty)
  - Added: (holding yellow)
- Resulting hand state after step: holding(yellow)

Step 12
- Action: stack yellow onto orange
- Plan entry: (stack yellow orange s11 s12)
- Timestamp: s11 → s12 (duration 1)
- Preconditions (must hold at s11): (holding yellow), (clear orange)
- Effects (applied at s12):
  - Deleted: (holding yellow), (clear orange)
  - Added: (on yellow orange), (clear yellow), (handempty)
- Resulting hand state after step: handempty

Final state at s12 (relevant facts)
- (on blue red)        — achieved at Step 8
- (on orange blue)     — achieved at Step 10
- (on yellow orange)   — achieved at Step 12
- (handempty)          — true at s12

Goal check
- Goal requires: (on blue red) AND (on orange blue) AND (on yellow orange)
- All three goal facts are present at time s12. Goal achieved.

Notes on bookkeeping and causal consistency
- Every action explicitly required handempty when picking/unstacking and left handempty after putdown/stack; holding predicates were created and deleted explicitly at each step.
- All intermediate clear/ontable/on facts used by later steps were produced or removed explicitly by listed effects; no implicit hand-state or relation changes were assumed.

This sequence exactly matches the provided PDDL plan and yields the requested final stacking order.
