9) t = 8.0 – 9.0 — Pick-up yellow from the table
- Action: pick-up(yellow)
- Effect summary: pick yellow up from the table into the hand (now holding yellow). yellow is no longer on the table. hand is not empty.

10) t = 9.0 – 10.0 — Stack yellow onto orange

11) t = 10.0 – 11.0 — Unstack red from blue
- Action: unstack(red, blue)
- Effect summary: pick red up from on top of blue into the hand (now holding red). blue becomes clear. red is no longer on blue. hand is not empty.

12) t = 11.0 – 12.0 — Put-down red on the table
- Action: put-down(red)
- Effect summary: place red onto the table (ontable red). red becomes clear. hand becomes empty.

13) t = 12.0 – 13.0 — Pick-up blue from the table

- Effect summary: pick blue up from the table into the hand (now holding blue). blue is no longer on the table. hand is not empty.

14) t = 13.0 – 14.0 — Stack blue onto yellow
- Action: stack(blue, yellow)
- Effect summary: place blue onto yellow (now on blue yellow). blue becomes clear. yellow is no longer clear. hand becomes empty.

15) t = 14.0 – 15.0 — Pick-up red from the table, then stack red onto blue
- Action: pick-up(red) at t=14.0–15.0? (As in original plan the last two actions are pick-up(red) then stack(red, blue). Preserving exact plan order:)
15a) t = 14.0 – 15.0 — Pick-up red from the table
- Action: pick-up(red)
- Effect summary: pick red up from the table into the hand (now holding red). red is no longer on the table. hand is not empty.

15b) t = 15.0 – 16.0 — Stack red onto blue

Final state (t = 16.0)
- On relations: red on blue; blue on yellow; yellow on orange
- Orange remains on the table
- Hand: empty

This sequence follows the provided plan exactly (same actions and order). Each action is a single-hand atomic operation respecting the pick-up / unstack / put-down / stack preconditions and effects.
