Below is a human-readable, step-by-step execution of the provided plan. Each step is listed in order, with a timestamp (stage numbers from the plan), a unit duration (1 time unit each, since the plan has cost = 14), the acting agent (manipulator), the action and its arguments, the action preconditions at that step, and the effects produced.

Step 1 — Time t = 0 → 1 (duration 1)
- Action: manipulator picks up red from the table.
- PDDL action: pick-up(red, s0, s1)
- Preconditions: red is on-table; red is clear; hand is empty.
- Effects: manipulator is holding red; red is no longer on-table; red is no longer clear; hand is not empty.

Step 2 — Time t = 1 → 2 (duration 1)
- Action: manipulator puts down red onto the table.
- PDDL action: put-down(red, s1, s2)
- Preconditions: manipulator is holding red.
- Effects: red is on-table; red becomes clear; manipulator is no longer holding red; hand becomes empty.

Step 3 — Time t = 2 → 3 (duration 1)
- Action: manipulator picks up red from the table again.
- PDDL action: pick-up(red, s2, s3)
- Preconditions: red is on-table; red is clear; hand is empty.
- Effects: manipulator is holding red; red is no longer on-table; red is no longer clear; hand is not empty.

Step 4 — Time t = 3 → 4 (duration 1)
- Action: manipulator puts down red onto the table again.
- PDDL action: put-down(red, s3, s4)
- Preconditions: manipulator is holding red.
- Effects: red is on-table; red becomes clear; manipulator is no longer holding red; hand becomes empty.

Step 5 — Time t = 4 → 5 (duration 1)
- Action: manipulator un-stacks yellow from on top of orange.
- PDDL action: unstack(yellow, orange, s4, s5)
- Preconditions: yellow is on orange; yellow is clear; hand is empty.
- Effects: manipulator is holding yellow; yellow is no longer on orange; yellow is no longer clear; orange becomes clear; hand is not empty.

Step 6 — Time t = 5 → 6 (duration 1)
- Action: manipulator puts down yellow onto the table.
- PDDL action: put-down(yellow, s5, s6)
- Preconditions: manipulator is holding yellow.
- Effects: yellow is on-table; yellow becomes clear; manipulator is no longer holding yellow; hand becomes empty.

Step 7 — Time t = 6 → 7 (duration 1)
- Action: manipulator un-stacks orange from on top of blue.
- PDDL action: unstack(orange, blue, s6, s7)
- Preconditions: orange is on blue; orange is clear; hand is empty.
- Effects: manipulator is holding orange; orange is no longer on blue; orange is no longer clear; blue becomes clear; hand is not empty.

Step 8 — Time t = 7 → 8 (duration 1)
- Action: manipulator puts down orange onto the table.
- PDDL action: put-down(orange, s7, s8)
- Preconditions: manipulator is holding orange.
- Effects: orange is on-table; orange becomes clear; manipulator is no longer holding orange; hand becomes empty.

Step 9 — Time t = 8 → 9 (duration 1)
- Action: manipulator picks up red from the table.
- PDDL action: pick-up(red, s8, s9)
- Preconditions: red is on-table; red is clear; hand is empty.
- Effects: manipulator is holding red; red is no longer on-table; red is no longer clear; hand is not empty.

Step 10 — Time t = 9 → 10 (duration 1)
- Action: manipulator stacks red onto blue.
- PDDL action: stack(red, blue, s9, s10)
- Preconditions: manipulator is holding red; blue is clear.
- Effects: red is on blue; red becomes clear; blue becomes not clear; manipulator is no longer holding red; red is not on-table; hand becomes empty.

Step 11 — Time t = 10 → 11 (duration 1)
- Action: manipulator picks up yellow from the table.
- PDDL action: pick-up(yellow, s10, s11)
- Preconditions: yellow is on-table; yellow is clear; hand is empty.
- Effects: manipulator is holding yellow; yellow is no longer on-table; yellow is no longer clear; hand is not empty.

Step 12 — Time t = 11 → 12 (duration 1)
- Action: manipulator stacks yellow onto red.
- PDDL action: stack(yellow, red, s11, s12)
- Preconditions: manipulator is holding yellow; red is clear.
- Effects: yellow is on red; yellow becomes clear; red becomes not clear; manipulator is no longer holding yellow; yellow is not on-table; hand becomes empty.

Step 13 — Time t = 12 → 13 (duration 1)
- Action: manipulator picks up orange from the table.
- PDDL action: pick-up(orange, s12, s13)
- Preconditions: orange is on-table; orange is clear; hand is empty.
- Effects: manipulator is holding orange; orange is no longer on-table; orange is no longer clear; hand is not empty.

Step 14 — Time t = 13 → 14 (duration 1)
- Action: manipulator stacks orange onto yellow.
- PDDL action: stack(orange, yellow, s13, s14)
- Preconditions: manipulator is holding orange; yellow is clear.
- Effects: orange is on yellow; orange becomes clear; yellow becomes not clear; manipulator is no longer holding orange; orange is not on-table; hand becomes empty.

Final state (after t = 14)
- Goal achieved: red on blue; orange on yellow; yellow on red.
- Hand is empty and the plan reached stage s14 as required.
