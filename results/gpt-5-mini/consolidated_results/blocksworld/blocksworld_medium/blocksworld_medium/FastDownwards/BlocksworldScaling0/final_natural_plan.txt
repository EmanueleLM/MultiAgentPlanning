Summary: each action below follows the given plan exactly. I assign each action a timestamp (start time) and assume a uniform duration of 1 time unit per action for readability. Preconditions listed are the facts that must hold immediately before the action; effects are the immediate state changes after the action. The state is updated step-by-step and the final goal (blue on yellow, yellow on red) is achieved. All actions respect the single-hand / single-block constraints.

Initial state (t = 0, before any action)
- Hand: block_player is EMPTY.
- Placements:
  - on(red, yellow)
  - on(blue, orange)
  - ontable(orange)
  - ontable(yellow)
- Clear: red, blue
- Current phase: phase1

Plan (each action duration = 1 time unit)

1) t = 0 → 1
Action: bp-unstack block_player red yellow
- Actor: block_player
- Preconditions:
  - block_player is a block-player
  - handempty(block_player) — true
  - on(red, yellow) — true
  - clear(red) — true
- Effects (applied immediately):
  - remove on(red, yellow)
  - holding(block_player, red)
  - handempty(block_player) becomes false
  - clear(yellow) becomes true (yellow now has no block on top)
  - clear(red) becomes false (red is held, not clear while held)
- State after action:
  - holding: red (by block_player)
  - hand: not empty
  - on: blue on orange remains
  - ontable: orange, yellow (yellow remained on table)
  - clear: yellow (now), blue
  - red is held (not on table, not on another block)

2) t = 1 → 2
Action: bp-put-down block_player red
- Actor: block_player
- Preconditions:
  - holding(block_player, red) — true
- Effects:
  - ontable(red)
  - handempty(block_player) becomes true
  - remove holding(block_player, red)
  - clear(red) becomes true (now on table with nothing on top)
- State after action:
  - hand: empty
  - ontable: orange, yellow, red
  - on: blue on orange
  - clear: red, yellow, blue

3) t = 2 → 3
Action: bp-pick-up block_player yellow
- Actor: block_player
- Preconditions:
  - is-block-player(block_player)
  - handempty(block_player) — true
  - ontable(yellow) — true
  - clear(yellow) — true
- Effects:
  - remove ontable(yellow)
  - holding(block_player, yellow)
  - handempty(block_player) becomes false
  - clear(yellow) becomes false (held, not clear)
- State after action:
  - holding: yellow
  - hand: not empty
  - on: blue on orange
  - ontable: orange, red
  - clear: red, blue

4) t = 3 → 4
Action: bp-stack block_player yellow red phase1
- Actor: block_player
- Preconditions:
  - holding(block_player, yellow) — true
  - clear(red) — true
  - current(phase1) — true
  - requires-on(phase1, yellow, red) — true (phase1 authorizes yellow on red)
- Effects:
  - on(yellow, red)
  - remove holding(block_player, yellow)
  - handempty(block_player) becomes true
  - clear(red) becomes false (red now has yellow on top)
  - clear(yellow) becomes true (placed, nothing on top of it)
  - remove ontable(yellow) (already removed when picked up)
- State after action:
  - hand: empty
  - on: yellow on red, blue on orange
  - ontable: orange, red
  - clear: yellow, blue
  - current phase: still phase1 (not advanced yet)

5) t = 4 → 5
Action: ta-advance temporal_auditor phase1 phase2 block_player yellow red
- Actor: temporal_auditor
- Preconditions:
  - is-temporal-auditor(temporal_auditor)
  - is-block-player(block_player)
  - current(phase1) — true
  - next(phase1, phase2) — true
  - requires-on(phase1, yellow, red) — true
  - on(yellow, red) — true (the required stacking for phase1 achieved)
  - handempty(block_player) — true (ensures no move in flight)
- Effects:
  - remove current(phase1)
  - current(phase2) becomes true
- State after action:
  - current phase: phase2
  - placements unchanged: yellow on red, blue on orange
  - hand: empty

6) t = 5 → 6
Action: bp-unstack block_player blue orange
- Actor: block_player
- Preconditions:
  - is-block-player(block_player)
  - handempty(block_player) — true
  - on(blue, orange) — true
  - clear(blue) — true
- Effects:
  - remove on(blue, orange)
  - holding(block_player, blue)
  - handempty(block_player) becomes false
  - clear(orange) becomes true (orange now has no block on top)
  - clear(blue) becomes false (held)
- State after action:
  - holding: blue
  - hand: not empty
  - on: yellow on red
  - ontable: orange, red
  - clear: yellow, orange

7) t = 6 → 7
Action: bp-stack block_player blue yellow phase2
- Actor: block_player
- Preconditions:
  - holding(block_player, blue) — true
  - clear(yellow) — true
  - current(phase2) — true
  - requires-on(phase2, blue, yellow) — true (phase2 authorizes blue on yellow)
- Effects:
  - on(blue, yellow)
  - remove holding(block_player, blue)
  - handempty(block_player) becomes true
  - clear(yellow) becomes false (yellow now has blue on top)
  - clear(blue) becomes true (placed, nothing on top)
  - remove ontable(blue) (blue now stacked)
- State after action (final):
  - on(blue, yellow) — true
  - on(yellow, red) — true
  - ontable: orange, red
  - hand: empty
  - clear: blue (top), red is not clear (has yellow), yellow is not clear (has blue) — (the necessary top/bottom statuses are consistent)

Final check
- Goal satisfied: on(blue, yellow) AND on(yellow, red) — both true at t = 7.
- Temporal & causal constraints respected:
  - Every pick/unstack occurred while the block_player's hand was empty.
  - Every put-down/stack emptied the hand.
  - No action moved more than one block at a time.
  - The temporal auditor advanced phase1→phase2 only after requires-on(phase1, yellow, red) was achieved and the block_player's hand was empty.
- Plan length / cost: 7 actions (unit cost per action), matching the provided plan.

This sequence exactly follows the supplied plan and satisfies the specification and the goal.
