Summary of initial state (time s0)
- Blocks: orange on blue, yellow on red, red on table, blue on table.
- Clear: orange, yellow.
- Hand: empty.
- Current stage: s0.

Plan (each action advances stage by one; treat each action as taking one time unit from sX to sY):

1) Action: lp-unstack orange blue (s0 → s1)
   - Human-readable: With the hand empty, lift orange off of blue (unstack orange from blue).
   - Preconditions checked at s0: hand empty; on(orange, blue); clear(orange).
   - Effects at s1: holding(orange); orange is no longer on blue; blue becomes clear; orange is not clear; hand is not empty; stage = s1.

2) Action: lp-putdown orange (s1 → s2)
   - Human-readable: Put the held orange down onto the table.
   - Preconditions checked at s1: holding(orange).
   - Effects at s2: orange is on the table; orange becomes clear; hand becomes empty; no longer holding orange; stage = s2.

3) Action: lp-unstack yellow red (s2 → s3)
   - Human-readable: With the hand empty, lift yellow off of red (unstack yellow from red).
   - Preconditions checked at s2: hand empty; on(yellow, red); clear(yellow).
   - Effects at s3: holding(yellow); yellow is no longer on red; red becomes clear; yellow is not clear; hand is not empty; stage = s3.

4) Action: lp-putdown yellow (s3 → s4)
   - Human-readable: Put the held yellow down onto the table.
   - Preconditions checked at s3: holding(yellow).
   - Effects at s4: yellow is on the table; yellow becomes clear; hand becomes empty; no longer holding yellow; stage = s4.

5) Action: lp-pickup red (s4 → s5)
   - Human-readable: With the hand empty, pick up red from the table.
   - Preconditions checked at s4: hand empty; ontable(red); clear(red).
   - Effects at s5: holding(red); red is no longer on the table; red is not clear; hand is not empty; stage = s5.

6) Action: lp-stack red blue (s5 → s6)
   - Human-readable: Place the held red block onto blue (stack red on blue).
   - Preconditions checked at s5: holding(red); clear(blue).
   - Effects at s6: on(red, blue); blue is no longer clear; red becomes clear; hand becomes empty; no longer holding red; stage = s6.

Final state (time s6)
- on(red, blue) — Goal satisfied.
- stage = s6.
- Hand is empty.

Cost: 6 actions (unit cost per action).
