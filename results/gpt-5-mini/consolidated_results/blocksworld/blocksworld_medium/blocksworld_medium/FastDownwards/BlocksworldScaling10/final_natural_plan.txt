Summary of timing convention
- Stages map to integer time steps: s0 = t=0, s1 = t=1, ..., s6 = t=6.
- Each action executes from its source stage to its next stage and takes 1 time unit.

Initial state (t=0, at s0)
- on(red, blue)
- on(blue, yellow)
- on(yellow, orange)
- ontable(orange)
- clear(red)
- handempty
- (implicitly:) clear(blue) = false, clear(yellow) = false, clear(orange) = false, holding(...) = false

Plan (each step listed with time interval, preconditions checked, effects applied, and the concise resulting state after the step)

1) t=0 → t=1 : unstack red from blue (unstack red blue s0 s1)
- Preconditions checked at t=0: on(red, blue), clear(red), handempty
- Effects at t=1:
  - Delete: on(red, blue)
  - Delete: clear(red)   (domain treats the held block as not clear)
  - Add: holding(red)
  - Add: clear(blue)
  - Delete: handempty
- Resulting state after step 1 (t=1):
  - holding(red)
  - clear(blue)
  - on(blue, yellow)
  - on(yellow, orange)
  - ontable(orange)
  - hand NOT empty

2) t=1 → t=2 : put-down red on the table (put-down red s1 s2)
- Preconditions checked at t=1: holding(red)
- Effects at t=2:
  - Add: ontable(red)
  - Add: clear(red)
  - Delete: holding(red)
  - Add: handempty
- Resulting state after step 2 (t=2):
  - ontable(red)
  - clear(red)
  - clear(blue)
  - on(blue, yellow)
  - on(yellow, orange)
  - ontable(orange)
  - handempty

3) t=2 → t=3 : unstack blue from yellow (unstack blue yellow s2 s3)
- Preconditions checked at t=2: on(blue, yellow), clear(blue), handempty
- Effects at t=3:
  - Delete: on(blue, yellow)
  - Delete: clear(blue)
  - Add: holding(blue)
  - Add: clear(yellow)
  - Delete: handempty
- Resulting state after step 3 (t=3):
  - holding(blue)
  - clear(yellow)
  - ontable(red)
  - on(yellow, orange)
  - ontable(orange)
  - hand NOT empty

4) t=3 → t=4 : put-down blue on the table (put-down blue s3 s4)
- Preconditions checked at t=3: holding(blue)
- Effects at t=4:
  - Add: ontable(blue)
  - Add: clear(blue)
  - Delete: holding(blue)
  - Add: handempty
- Resulting state after step 4 (t=4):
  - ontable(red)
  - ontable(blue)
  - clear(blue)
  - clear(red)
  - clear(yellow)
  - on(yellow, orange)
  - ontable(orange)
  - handempty

5) t=4 → t=5 : unstack yellow from orange (unstack yellow orange s4 s5)
- Preconditions checked at t=4: on(yellow, orange), clear(yellow), handempty
- Effects at t=5:
  - Delete: on(yellow, orange)
  - Delete: clear(yellow)
  - Add: holding(yellow)
  - Add: clear(orange)
  - Delete: handempty
- Resulting state after step 5 (t=5):
  - holding(yellow)
  - clear(orange)
  - ontable(red)
  - ontable(blue)
  - ontable(orange)
  - hand NOT empty

6) t=5 → t=6 : stack yellow onto red (stack yellow red s5 s6)
- Preconditions checked at t=5: holding(yellow), clear(red), (yellow ≠ red)
- Effects at t=6 (final):
  - Add: on(yellow, red)
  - Add: clear(yellow)
  - Delete: clear(red)
  - Delete: holding(yellow)
  - Add: handempty
- Final state after step 6 (t=6):
  - on(yellow, red)  ← Goal achieved
  - ontable(red)     (red remains on table under yellow)
  - ontable(blue)
  - ontable(orange)
  - clear(yellow)
  - clear(blue)
  - clear(orange)
  - handempty

Goal verification
- Final condition (on yellow red) is satisfied at t=6.

Plan cost
- 6 actions, unit cost per action → total cost = 6.
