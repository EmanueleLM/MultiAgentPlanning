Below is a clear, step-by-step, human-readable execution of the provided plan. Each step corresponds exactly to one action in the plan, shows the stage transition as a timestamp (Stage → Stage+1), lists the required preconditions before the action, and lists the immediate effects after the action. Each action is assumed to take 1 time unit (timestamp increments by 1).

Initial state at Time 0 (stage0):
- Spatial facts: blue on red; red on table; orange on table; yellow on table
- Clear: blue, orange, yellow
- Hand: empty (h is empty)
- Current stage: stage0

Step 1 — Time 0 → Time 1 (unstack blue from red)
- Action: Unstack block blue from block red using hand h.
- Preconditions (must hold at Time 0):
  - current = stage0
  - on(blue, red)
  - clear(blue)
  - handempty(h)
- Effects (after action, at Time 1):
  - holding(h, blue)
  - not on(blue, red)
  - clear(red)
  - not clear(blue)
  - not handempty(h) (hand is now occupied)
  - current = stage1

Step 2 — Time 1 → Time 2 (put blue down on the table)
- Action: Put down block blue from hand h onto the table.
- Preconditions (must hold at Time 1):
  - current = stage1
  - holding(h, blue)
- Effects (after action, at Time 2):
  - ontable(blue)
  - clear(blue)
  - handempty(h) (hand becomes empty)
  - not holding(h, blue)
  - current = stage2

Step 3 — Time 2 → Time 3 (pick up yellow from the table)
- Action: Pick up block yellow from the table with hand h.
- Preconditions (must hold at Time 2):
  - current = stage2
  - ontable(yellow)
  - clear(yellow)
  - handempty(h)
- Effects (after action, at Time 3):
  - holding(h, yellow)
  - not ontable(yellow)
  - not clear(yellow)
  - not handempty(h)
  - current = stage3

Step 4 — Time 3 → Time 4 (stack yellow onto red)
- Action: Stack block yellow (held in h) onto block red.
- Preconditions (must hold at Time 3):
  - current = stage3
  - holding(h, yellow)
  - clear(red)
- Effects (after action, at Time 4):
  - on(yellow, red)
  - not ontable(yellow)
  - clear(yellow)
  - not clear(red)
  - handempty(h)
  - not holding(h, yellow)
  - current = stage4

Step 5 — Time 4 → Time 5 (pick up blue from the table)
- Action: Pick up block blue from the table with hand h.
- Preconditions (must hold at Time 4):
  - current = stage4
  - ontable(blue)
  - clear(blue)
  - handempty(h)
- Effects (after action, at Time 5):
  - holding(h, blue)
  - not ontable(blue)
  - not clear(blue)
  - not handempty(h)
  - current = stage5

Step 6 — Time 5 → Time 6 (stack blue onto yellow)
- Action: Stack block blue (held in h) onto block yellow.
- Preconditions (must hold at Time 5):
  - current = stage5
  - holding(h, blue)
  - clear(yellow)
- Effects (after action, at Time 6):
  - on(blue, yellow)
  - not ontable(blue)
  - clear(blue)
  - not clear(yellow)
  - handempty(h)
  - not holding(h, blue)
  - current = stage6

Final state at Time 6 (stage6):
- Achieved goal facts:
  - on(blue, yellow)
  - on(yellow, red)
- Hand: empty (h)
- Current stage: stage6

Total plan duration: 6 time units (one unit per action). The sequence respects the single-hand constraint throughout (hand is empty before every pickup/unstack and is occupied between pickup/unstack and the corresponding put/stack).
