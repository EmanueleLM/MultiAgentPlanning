Initial conditions (time t0, stage s0)
- Blocks: red on orange; blue on table; orange on table; yellow on table.
- Clear: red, blue, yellow. (orange is not listed clear → not clear)
- Hand: empty.
- Stage: s0
- Goal: on blue orange, on orange yellow (achieved at stage s6).

Plan (each action consumes 1 time unit; timestamps show start → end; stages advance s0→s6 exactly as in the PDDL plan):

Step 1 — unstack(red, orange) [unstack red orange s0→s1]
- Time: t0 → t1 (duration 1)
- Required preconditions:
  - at-stage s0 (current)
  - succ s0 s1 (given)
  - handempty (true)
  - on(red, orange) (true)
  - clear(red) (true)
- Effects (applied at t1):
  - Positive: holding(red); at-stage s1; clear(orange)
  - Negative: handempty; on(red, orange); clear(red); not at-stage s0
- Verification: preconditions held at t0. After action, agent is holding red; orange becomes clear.

Step 2 — put-down(red) [put-down red s1→s2]
- Time: t1 → t2 (duration 1)
- Required preconditions:
  - at-stage s1 (current)
  - succ s1 s2 (given)
  - holding(red) (true after Step 1)
- Effects (applied at t2):
  - Positive: handempty; ontable(red); clear(red); at-stage s2
  - Negative: holding(red); not at-stage s1
- Verification: holding(red) is true at t1. After action, red is on the table and hand is empty. Orange remains clear.

Step 3 — pick-up(orange) [pick-up orange s2→s3]
- Time: t2 → t3 (duration 1)
- Required preconditions:
  - at-stage s2 (current)
  - succ s2 s3 (given)
  - handempty (true after Step 2)
  - ontable(orange) (true initially and unchanged)
  - clear(orange) (true after Step 1 and unchanged by Step 2)
- Effects (applied at t3):
  - Positive: holding(orange); at-stage s3
  - Negative: handempty; ontable(orange); clear(orange); not at-stage s2
- Verification: all preconditions hold at t2. After action, agent holds orange; orange is no longer clear.

Step 4 — stack(orange, yellow) [stack orange yellow s3→s4]
- Time: t3 → t4 (duration 1)
- Required preconditions:
  - at-stage s3 (current)
  - succ s3 s4 (given)
  - holding(orange) (true after Step 3)
  - clear(yellow) (true from initial state and not modified so far)
- Effects (applied at t4):
  - Positive: on(orange, yellow); clear(orange); at-stage s4
  - Negative: holding(orange); not clear(yellow); not at-stage s3; hand becomes empty (handempty becomes true)
- Verification: preconditions held at t3. After action, orange is stacked on yellow; orange becomes clear; yellow becomes not clear; hand is empty.

Step 5 — pick-up(blue) [pick-up blue s4→s5]
- Time: t4 → t5 (duration 1)
- Required preconditions:
  - at-stage s4 (current)
  - succ s4 s5 (given)
  - handempty (true after Step 4)
  - ontable(blue) (true initially and unchanged)
  - clear(blue) (true initially and unchanged)
- Effects (applied at t5):
  - Positive: holding(blue); at-stage s5
  - Negative: handempty; ontable(blue); clear(blue); not at-stage s4
- Verification: all preconditions hold at t4. After action, agent holds blue.

Step 6 — stack(blue, orange) [stack blue orange s5→s6]
- Time: t5 → t6 (duration 1)
- Required preconditions:
  - at-stage s5 (current)
  - succ s5 s6 (given)
  - holding(blue) (true after Step 5)
  - clear(orange) (true after Step 4)
- Effects (applied at t6):
  - Positive: on(blue, orange); clear(blue); at-stage s6; handempty
  - Negative: holding(blue); not clear(orange); not at-stage s5
- Verification: preconditions held at t5. After action, blue is stacked on orange; orange is no longer clear; hand is empty.

Final state at t6 (stage s6)
- on(blue, orange) — true (goal satisfied)
- on(orange, yellow) — true (goal satisfied)
- handempty — true
- Total plan duration: 6 time units
- Plan cost (unit-cost actions): 6

Notes on compliance
- Single-handed constraint satisfied: every pick-up/unstack required handempty and those preconditions held; each stack/put-down produced handempty afterward.
- Clearing constraints respected: unstack only when target block was clear; stack only onto clear blocks.
- Stages advanced sequentially s0→s1→...→s6 as in the PDDL plan.

This sequence exactly follows the given PDDL plan steps and achieves the stated goal.
