Step 1 — Time s0 → s1 (t0–t1, duration 1)
- Action: unstack(orchestrator, blue, orange)
- Description: The orchestrator un-stacks the blue block from on top of the orange block and takes (holds) the blue block.
- Preconditions (checked): orchestrator's hand is free; blue is on orange; blue is clear.

Step 2 — Time s1 → s2 (t1–t2, duration 1)
- Action: put-down(orchestrator, blue)
- Description: The orchestrator puts the held blue block down onto the table.
- Preconditions (checked): orchestrator is holding blue.
- Immediate effects: blue is on the table; orchestrator's hand becomes free; blue is clear.

Step 3 — Time s2 → s3 (t2–t3, duration 1)
- Action: pick-up(orchestrator, yellow)
- Description: The orchestrator picks up the yellow block from the table (holds yellow).
- Preconditions (checked): orchestrator's hand is free; yellow is on the table; yellow is clear.
- Immediate effects: yellow is no longer on the table; orchestrator is holding yellow; yellow is not clear while held; orchestrator's hand is no longer free.

Step 4 — Time s3 → s4 (t3–t4, duration 1)
- Action: stack(orchestrator, yellow, orange)
- Description: The orchestrator stacks the held yellow block onto the orange block.
- Preconditions (checked): orchestrator is holding yellow; orange is clear.
- Immediate effects: yellow is on orange; orchestrator is no longer holding yellow (hand becomes free); orange is no longer clear; yellow is clear (no block on top).

Step 5 — Time s4 → s5 (t4–t5, duration 1)
- Action: pick-up(orchestrator, blue)
- Description: The orchestrator picks up the blue block from the table (holds blue).
- Preconditions (checked): orchestrator's hand is free; blue is on the table; blue is clear.
- Immediate effects: blue is no longer on the table; orchestrator is holding blue; blue is not clear while held; orchestrator's hand is no longer free.

Step 6 — Time s5 → s6 (t5–t6, duration 1)
- Action: stack(orchestrator, blue, yellow)
- Description: The orchestrator stacks the held blue block on top of the yellow block.
- Preconditions (checked): orchestrator is holding blue; yellow is clear.
- Immediate effects: blue is on yellow; orchestrator is no longer holding blue (hand becomes free); yellow is no longer clear; blue is clear.

Step 7 — Time s6 → s7 (t6–t7, duration 1)
- Action: pick-up(orchestrator, red)
- Description: The orchestrator picks up the red block from the table (holds red).
- Preconditions (checked): orchestrator's hand is free; red is on the table; red is clear.
- Immediate effects: red is no longer on the table; orchestrator is holding red; red is not clear while held; orchestrator's hand is no longer free.

Step 8 — Time s7 → s8 (t7–t8, duration 1)
- Action: stack(orchestrator, red, blue)
- Description: The orchestrator stacks the held red block on top of the blue block.
- Preconditions (checked): orchestrator is holding red; blue is clear.
- Immediate effects: red is on blue; orchestrator is no longer holding red (hand becomes free); blue is no longer clear; red is clear.

Final state (at s8 / t8)
- Tower achieved: red on blue, blue on yellow, yellow on orange.
- Orchestrator's hand: free.
- Total actions executed: 8 (unit cost each; total cost = 8).
