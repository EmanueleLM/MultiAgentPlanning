Initial state (time 0)
- Blocks: red, yellow, orange, blue
- Relations:
  - (on red yellow)
  - (on yellow orange)
  - (on-table orange)
  - (on-table blue)
  - (clear red)
  - (clear blue)
  - (hand-empty)

Planned action sequence (each step duration = 1 time unit; discrete timestamps shown as [start → end]):

1) [t=0 → t=1] unstack(red, yellow)
   - Preconditions checked: red is on yellow, red is clear, hand is empty — all true.
   - Effect summary: remove (on red yellow); agent is now holding red; yellow becomes clear; red is not clear; hand is not empty.

2) [t=1 → t=2] putdown(red)
   - Preconditions checked: holding red — true (from previous step).
   - Effect summary: place red on the table (on-table red); red becomes clear; hand becomes empty; no longer holding red.

3) [t=2 → t=3] unstack(yellow, orange)
   - Preconditions checked: yellow is on orange, yellow is clear (made clear in step 1), hand is empty — all true.
   - Effect summary: remove (on yellow orange); agent is now holding yellow; orange becomes clear; yellow is not clear; hand is not empty.

4) [t=3 → t=4] putdown(yellow)
   - Preconditions checked: holding yellow — true.
   - Effect summary: place yellow on the table (on-table yellow); yellow becomes clear; hand becomes empty; no longer holding yellow.

5) [t=4 → t=5] pickup(orange)
   - Preconditions checked: orange is on the table and clear (made clear in step 3), hand is empty — all true.
   - Effect summary: agent is now holding orange; (on-table orange) removed; orange is not clear; hand is not empty.

6) [t=5 → t=6] stack(orange, yellow)
   - Preconditions checked: holding orange (from step 5) and yellow is clear (put down in step 4) — true.
   - Effect summary: place orange on yellow (on orange yellow); orange becomes clear (per domain); yellow becomes not clear; hand becomes empty; no longer holding orange.

7) [t=6 → t=7] pickup(blue)
   - Preconditions checked: blue is on the table and clear, hand is empty — true.
   - Effect summary: agent is now holding blue; (on-table blue) removed; blue is not clear; hand is not empty.

8) [t=7 → t=8] stack(blue, orange)
   - Preconditions checked: holding blue (from step 7) and orange is clear (orange was made clear in step 6) — true.
   - Effect summary: place blue on orange (on blue orange); blue becomes clear; orange becomes not clear; hand becomes empty; no longer holding blue.

Final state (after t=8)
- Goal facts achieved:
  - (on blue orange)
  - (on orange yellow)
- Hand is empty.

Notes
- Sequence matches the provided plan exactly and respects all preconditions and single-move constraint at every step.
- Each step is temporally ordered (no concurrency). Each action duration is listed as 1 time unit for clarity.
