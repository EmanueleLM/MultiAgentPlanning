Plan execution (each action assumed to take 1 time unit; timestamps shown as [start — end)):

1) t = [0 — 1): Unstack orange from red (unstack worker orange red p1)
- Actor: worker, Phase: p1
- Preconditions: phase-active p1; worker's hand is empty; orange is clear; orange is on red (and not on the table).
- Effects: orange is removed from on(red) (no longer on red); worker is holding orange; worker's hand becomes not empty; red becomes clear; orange is not clear.
- Legality: legal (matches initial facts: orange was clear and on red; phase p1 is active).

2) t = [1 — 2): Put orange down on the table (putdown-table worker orange p1)
- Actor: worker, Phase: p1
- Preconditions: phase-active p1; worker is holding orange.
- Effects: worker no longer holds orange; worker's hand becomes empty; orange is on the table; orange becomes clear.
- Legality: legal (worker was holding orange from step 1).

3) t = [2 — 3): Unstack blue from yellow (unstack worker blue yellow p1)
- Actor: worker, Phase: p1
- Preconditions: phase-active p1; worker's hand is empty; blue is clear; blue is on yellow (and not on the table).
- Effects: blue is removed from on(yellow); worker is holding blue; worker's hand becomes not empty; yellow becomes clear; blue is not clear.
- Legality: legal (initial state had blue clear on yellow; worker's hand was made empty in step 2).

4) t = [3 — 4): Stack blue onto red and advance phase to p2 (stack-onto worker blue red p1 p2)
- Actor: worker, From phase p1 to p2
- Preconditions: phase-active p1; worker is holding blue; red is clear; requires-phase(blue, red) bound to p1; next-phase(p1, p2) holds.
- Effects: worker no longer holds blue; worker's hand becomes empty; blue is on red; red becomes not clear; blue becomes clear; phase p1 becomes inactive and phase p2 becomes active.
- Legality: legal (blue was held from step 3, red was clear from initial state and from step 1).

5) t = [4 — 5): Pick up yellow from the table (pickup-table worker yellow p2)
- Actor: worker, Phase: p2
- Preconditions: phase-active p2; worker's hand is empty; yellow is clear; yellow is on the table.
- Effects: yellow is removed from on-table; worker is holding yellow; worker's hand becomes not empty; yellow becomes not clear.
- Legality: legal (phase advanced to p2 in step 4; yellow became clear in step 3 when blue was removed from it; yellow was on the table initially).

6) t = [5 — 6): Stack yellow onto blue and advance phase to p3 (stack-onto worker yellow blue p2 p3)
- Actor: worker, From phase p2 to p3
- Preconditions: phase-active p2; worker is holding yellow; blue is clear; requires-phase(yellow, blue) bound to p2; next-phase(p2, p3) holds.
- Effects: worker no longer holds yellow; worker's hand becomes empty; yellow is on blue; blue becomes not clear; yellow becomes clear; phase p2 becomes inactive and phase p3 becomes active.
- Legality: legal (yellow was held from step 5; blue was made clear in step 4 when it was stacked onto red).

7) t = [6 — 7): Pick up orange from the table (pickup-table worker orange p3)
- Actor: worker, Phase: p3
- Preconditions: phase-active p3; worker's hand is empty; orange is clear; orange is on the table.
- Effects: orange is removed from on-table; worker is holding orange; worker's hand becomes not empty; orange becomes not clear.
- Legality: legal (orange was put on the table and left clear in step 2; phase p3 active after step 6).

8) t = [7 — 8): Stack orange onto yellow and advance phase to p4 (stack-onto worker orange yellow p3 p4)
- Actor: worker, From phase p3 to p4
- Preconditions: phase-active p3; worker is holding orange; yellow is clear; requires-phase(orange, yellow) bound to p3; next-phase(p3, p4) holds.
- Effects: worker no longer holds orange; worker's hand becomes empty; orange is on yellow; yellow becomes not clear; orange becomes clear; phase p3 becomes inactive and phase p4 becomes active.
- Legality: legal (orange was held from step 7; yellow was clear after step 6).

Final state after t = 8:
- on blue red (established in step 4)
- on yellow blue (established in step 6)
- on orange yellow (established in step 8)
- handempty worker (established by final action effect)
- phase-active p4

This sequence matches the provided plan step-for-step, respects single-hand and clearness constraints, and achieves the goal: blue on red, yellow on blue, orange on yellow, with the worker's hand empty.
