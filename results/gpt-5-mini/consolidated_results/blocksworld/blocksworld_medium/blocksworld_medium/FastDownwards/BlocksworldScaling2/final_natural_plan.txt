Sequence of actions (each action consumes one phase step; assume each step takes 1 time unit). Start time t = 0 with current phase p1 and hand empty.

1) t = 0 → 1: unstack(orange, blue)   [phase p1 -> p2]
   - Preconditions: orange is on blue, orange is clear (nothing on orange), hand is empty, current = p1.
   - Effect: agent is holding orange; orange is no longer on blue nor on the table; blue becomes clear; orange is not clear while held; hand is not empty; current = p2.

2) t = 1 → 2: putdown(orange)   [phase p2 -> p3]
   - Preconditions: agent is holding orange, current = p2.
   - Effect: orange is on the table and clear; agent is not holding orange; hand becomes empty; current = p3.

3) t = 2 → 3: pickup(red)   [phase p3 -> p4]
   - Preconditions: red is on the table, red is clear, hand is empty, current = p3.
   - Effect: agent is holding red; red is no longer on the table; red is not clear while held; hand becomes not empty; current = p4.

4) t = 3 → 4: stack(red, orange)   [phase p4 -> p5]
   - Preconditions: agent is holding red, orange is clear, current = p4.
   - Effect: red is on orange; red becomes clear (nothing on it); orange becomes not clear; agent is no longer holding red; hand becomes empty; red is not on the table; current = p5.

5) t = 4 → 5: unstack(blue, yellow)   [phase p5 -> p6]
   - Preconditions: blue is on yellow, blue is clear, hand is empty, current = p5.
   - Effect: agent is holding blue; blue is no longer on yellow nor on the table; yellow becomes clear; blue is not clear while held; hand becomes not empty; current = p6.

6) t = 5 → 6: stack(blue, red)   [phase p6 -> p7]
   - Preconditions: agent is holding blue, red is clear, current = p6.
   - Effect: blue is on red; blue becomes clear; red becomes not clear; agent is no longer holding blue; hand becomes empty; blue is not on the table; current = p7.

Result after t = 6 (current = p7):
- Goal achieved: red is on orange, blue is on red.
- Hand is empty.
- Total actions (cost) = 6 (one unit per action).
