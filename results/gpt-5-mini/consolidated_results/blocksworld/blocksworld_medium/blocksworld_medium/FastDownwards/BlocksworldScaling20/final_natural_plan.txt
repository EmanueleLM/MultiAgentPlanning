   Preconditions satisfied: holding(a1, blue).
   Effects (applied): a1 is hand-empty; a1 no longer holding blue; blue is on the table (on-table blue); blue becomes clear.

5) Time t4 → t5 (duration 1)

   Preconditions satisfied: holding(a1, yellow); clear(blue).
   Effects (applied): a1 becomes hand-empty; a1 no longer holding yellow; yellow is now on blue (on yellow blue); blue is no longer clear; yellow becomes clear (top of its stack).

7) Time t6 → t7 (duration 1)
