Plan (step-by-step, matching the provided PDDL plan exactly). Each step lists the action, the blocks involved, required preconditions, effects, and the discrete timestamp expressed as the slot transition (each action advances the current slot to its successor). Assume each action occupies one discrete time-step (duration = 1 time unit), i.e., s1→s2 is time step 1, s2→s3 is time step 2, etc.

1) Time s1 → s2 (duration 1)
   Action: Unstack blue from yellow
   - Parameters: b = blue, c = yellow
   - Preconditions: blue is on yellow; blue is clear; hand is empty; current = s1; slot-next(s1, s2)
   - Effects: agent is holding blue; blue is no longer on yellow; yellow becomes clear; blue is no longer clear; hand becomes not empty; current becomes s2

2) Time s2 → s3 (duration 1)
   Action: PutDown blue (onto the table)
   - Parameters: b = blue
   - Preconditions: holding blue; current = s2; slot-next(s2, s3)
   - Effects: blue is on-table; blue becomes clear; hand becomes empty; no longer holding blue; current becomes s3

3) Time s3 → s4 (duration 1)
   Action: Unstack orange from red
   - Parameters: b = orange, c = red
   - Preconditions: orange is on red; orange is clear; hand is empty; current = s3; slot-next(s3, s4)
   - Effects: agent is holding orange; orange is no longer on red; red becomes clear; orange is no longer clear; hand becomes not empty; current becomes s4

4) Time s4 → s5 (duration 1)
   Action: PutDown orange (onto the table)
   - Parameters: b = orange
   - Preconditions: holding orange; current = s4; slot-next(s4, s5)
   - Effects: orange is on-table; orange becomes clear; hand becomes empty; no longer holding orange; current becomes s5

5) Time s5 → s6 (duration 1)
   Action: PickUp red (from the table)
   - Parameters: b = red
   - Preconditions: red is on-table; red is clear; hand is empty; current = s5; slot-next(s5, s6)
   - Effects: agent is holding red; red is no longer on-table; red is no longer clear; hand becomes not empty; current becomes s6

6) Time s6 → s7 (duration 1)
   Action: Stack red onto orange
   - Parameters: b = red (held), c = orange (destination)
   - Preconditions: holding red; orange is clear; current = s6; slot-next(s6, s7)
   - Effects: red is on orange; orange becomes not clear; red becomes clear; hand becomes empty; no longer holding red; red is not on-table; current becomes s7

7) Time s7 → s8 (duration 1)
   Action: PickUp yellow (from the table)
   - Parameters: b = yellow
   - Preconditions: yellow is on-table; yellow is clear; hand is empty; current = s7; slot-next(s7, s8)
   - Effects: agent is holding yellow; yellow is no longer on-table; yellow is no longer clear; hand becomes not empty; current becomes s8

8) Time s8 → s9 (duration 1)
   Action: Stack yellow onto red
   - Parameters: b = yellow (held), c = red (destination)
   - Preconditions: holding yellow; red is clear; current = s8; slot-next(s8, s9)
   - Effects: yellow is on red; red becomes not clear; yellow becomes clear; hand becomes empty; no longer holding yellow; yellow is not on-table; current becomes s9

Outcome (after s8 → s9):
- Goal satisfied: red is on orange, and yellow is on red.
- Total actions: 8. Total discrete time-steps (slots advanced): s1 → s9 (8 steps).
