1) Step 1 — lifter_unstack(worker, blue, yellow) — time t0 → t1  
   - Action: worker un-stacks blue from on top of yellow.  
   - Preconditions at t0: worker’s hand is empty; blue is clear; blue is on yellow.  
   - Effects at t1: worker is holding blue (hand no longer empty); blue is no longer on yellow; yellow becomes clear; blue becomes not clear. The global time marker advances from t0 to t1.

2) Step 2 — placer_putdown(worker, blue) — time t1 → t2  
   - Action: worker puts down blue onto the table.  
   - Preconditions at t1: worker is holding blue.  
   - Effects at t2: worker’s hand becomes empty; worker is no longer holding blue; blue is on the table (ontable blue); blue is clear. Time advances from t1 to t2.

3) Step 3 — lifter_unstack(worker, yellow, red) — time t2 → t3  
   - Action: worker un-stacks yellow from on top of red.  
   - Preconditions at t2: worker’s hand is empty; yellow is clear; yellow is on red.  
   - Effects at t3: worker is holding yellow (hand no longer empty); yellow is no longer on red; red becomes clear; yellow becomes not clear. Time advances from t2 to t3.

4) Step 4 — placer_putdown(worker, yellow) — time t3 → t4  
   - Action: worker puts down yellow onto the table.  
   - Preconditions at t3: worker is holding yellow.  
   - Effects at t4: worker’s hand becomes empty; worker is no longer holding yellow; yellow is on the table (ontable yellow); yellow is clear. Time advances from t3 to t4.

5) Step 5 — lifter_pickup(worker, blue) — time t4 → t5  
   - Action: worker picks up blue from the table.  
   - Preconditions at t4: worker’s hand is empty; blue is on the table; blue is clear.  
   - Effects at t5: worker is holding blue (hand not empty); blue is no longer on the table; blue becomes not clear. Time advances from t4 to t5.

6) Step 6 — placer_stack(worker, blue, red) — time t5 → t6  
   - Action: worker stacks blue onto red.  
   - Preconditions at t5: worker is holding blue; red is clear; blue ≠ red.  
   - Effects at t6: worker’s hand becomes empty; worker is no longer holding blue; blue is on red; red becomes not clear; blue becomes clear. Time advances from t5 to t6.

7) Step 7 — lifter_pickup(worker, orange) — time t6 → t7  
   - Action: worker picks up orange from the table.  
   - Preconditions at t6: worker’s hand is empty; orange is on the table; orange is clear.  
   - Effects at t7: worker is holding orange (hand not empty); orange is no longer on the table; orange becomes not clear. Time advances from t6 to t7.

8) Step 8 — placer_stack(worker, orange, yellow) — time t7 → t8  
   - Action: worker stacks orange onto yellow.  
   - Preconditions at t7: worker is holding orange; yellow is clear; orange ≠ yellow.  
   - Effects at t8: worker’s hand becomes empty; worker is no longer holding orange; orange is on yellow; yellow becomes not clear; orange becomes clear. Time advances from t7 to t8.

Final state at t8 (goal): blue is on red and orange is on yellow, and the time marker is at t8 — goal achieved.
