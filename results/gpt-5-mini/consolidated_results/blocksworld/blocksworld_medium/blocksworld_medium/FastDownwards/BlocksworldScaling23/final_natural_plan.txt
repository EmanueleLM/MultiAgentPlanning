- Effects after action: holding(yellow); hand no longer empty; yellow is no longer on red; red becomes clear; yellow is not clear; at-stage stage1.

2) Time 1 → 2 (stage1 → stage2): (placer-put-down yellow stage1 stage2)
- Action: Placer puts down yellow onto the table.
- Preconditions: holding(yellow); at-stage stage1.
- Effects after action: on-table(yellow); yellow is clear; hand becomes empty; not holding(yellow); at-stage stage2.

3) Time 2 → 3 (stage2 → stage3): (placer-unstack red blue stage2 stage3)
- Action: Placer un-stacks red from on top of blue.
- Preconditions: hand empty; red is clear; red is on blue; at-stage stage2.
- Effects after action: holding(red); hand no longer empty; red is no longer on blue; blue becomes clear; red is not clear; at-stage stage3.

4) Time 3 → 4 (stage3 → stage4): (placer-put-down red stage3 stage4)
- Action: Placer puts down red onto the table.
- Preconditions: holding(red); at-stage stage3.
- Effects after action: on-table(red); red is clear; hand becomes empty; not holding(red); at-stage stage4.

5) Time 4 → 5 (stage4 → stage5): (placer-pick-up orange stage4 stage5)
- Action: Placer picks up orange from the table.
- Preconditions: hand empty; orange is clear; orange is on-table; at-stage stage4.
- Effects after action: holding(orange); hand no longer empty; orange is no longer on-table; orange is not clear; at-stage stage5.

6) Time 5 → 6 (stage5 → stage6): (placer-stack orange blue stage5 stage6)
- Action: Placer stacks orange onto blue.
- Preconditions: holding(orange); blue is clear; at-stage stage5.
- Effects after action: on(orange, blue); blue is no longer clear; orange becomes clear; hand becomes empty; not holding(orange); orange is not on-table; at-stage stage6.

7) Time 6 → 7 (stage6 → stage7): (placer-pick-up red stage6 stage7)
- Action: Placer picks up red from the table.
- Preconditions: hand empty; red is clear; red is on-table; at-stage stage6.
- Effects after action: holding(red); hand no longer empty; red is no longer on-table; red is not clear; at-stage stage7.

8) Time 7 → 8 (stage7 → stage8): (placer-stack red orange stage7 stage8)
- Action: Placer stacks red onto orange.
- Preconditions: holding(red); orange is clear; at-stage stage7.
- Effects after action: on(red, orange); orange is no longer clear; red becomes clear; hand becomes empty; not holding(red); red is not on-table; at-stage stage8.

Final state at time 8 (stage8):
