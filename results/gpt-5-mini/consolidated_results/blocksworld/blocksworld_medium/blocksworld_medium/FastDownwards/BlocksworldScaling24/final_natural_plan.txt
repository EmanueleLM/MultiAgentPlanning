Below is a clear, step-by-step human-readable execution of the provided plan. Each step matches exactly one action from the plan (no actions added or removed), lists the operator action, its concrete parameters, the instantaneous preconditions that must hold at the time, and the effects produced. I report a simple timestamp for each step (1 time unit per action) to show ordering/duration.

Summary of timing convention: Step N executes during time interval [N-1, N). Total cost = 8 time units.

1) Time [0,1): operator_unstack(blue, orange) — stage s0 -> s1
   - Preconditions at start of step:
     - blue is on orange (on blue orange)
     - blue is clear (clear blue)
     - hand is empty (handempty)
     - current stage is s0 (current s0) and succ(s0,s1)
   - Effects at end of step:
     - operator is holding blue (holding blue)
     - orange becomes clear (clear orange)
     - blue is no longer on orange (not (on blue orange))
     - blue is not on the table (not (ontable blue))
     - blue is no longer clear while held (not (clear blue))
     - hand is not empty (not (handempty))
     - stage advances to s1 (not current s0; current s1)

2) Time [1,2): operator_putdown(blue) — stage s1 -> s2
   - Preconditions:
     - operator is holding blue (holding blue)
     - current stage is s1 and succ(s1,s2)
   - Effects:
     - blue is placed on the table (ontable blue)
     - blue becomes clear (clear blue)
     - hand becomes empty (handempty)
     - operator no longer holds blue (not (holding blue))
     - stage advances to s2 (not current s1; current s2)

3) Time [2,3): operator_pickup(orange) — stage s2 -> s3
   - Preconditions:
     - orange is on the table (ontable orange)
     - orange is clear (clear orange)
     - hand is empty (handempty)
     - current stage is s2 and succ(s2,s3)
   - Effects:
     - operator is holding orange (holding orange)
     - orange is no longer on the table (not (ontable orange))
     - orange is not clear while held (not (clear orange))
     - hand is not empty (not (handempty))
     - stage advances to s3 (not current s2; current s3)

4) Time [3,4): operator_stack(orange, yellow) — stage s3 -> s4
   - Preconditions:
     - operator is holding orange (holding orange)
     - yellow is clear (clear yellow)
     - current stage is s3 and succ(s3,s4)
   - Effects:
     - orange is placed on yellow (on orange yellow)
     - orange becomes clear (clear orange)
     - hand becomes empty (handempty)
     - operator no longer holds orange (not (holding orange))
     - yellow becomes not clear (not (clear yellow))
     - orange is not on the table (not (ontable orange))
     - stage advances to s4 (not current s3; current s4)

5) Time [4,5): operator_pickup(blue) — stage s4 -> s5
   - Preconditions:
     - blue is on the table (ontable blue)
     - blue is clear (clear blue)
     - hand is empty (handempty)
     - current stage is s4 and succ(s4,s5)
   - Effects:
     - operator is holding blue (holding blue)
     - blue is no longer on the table (not (ontable blue))
     - blue is not clear while held (not (clear blue))
     - hand is not empty (not (handempty))
     - stage advances to s5 (not current s4; current s5)

6) Time [5,6): operator_stack(blue, orange) — stage s5 -> s6
   - Preconditions:
     - operator is holding blue (holding blue)
     - orange is clear (clear orange)
     - current stage is s5 and succ(s5,s6)
   - Effects:
     - blue is placed on orange (on blue orange)
     - blue becomes clear (clear blue)
     - hand becomes empty (handempty)
     - operator no longer holds blue (not (holding blue))
     - orange becomes not clear (not (clear orange))
     - blue is not on the table (not (ontable blue))
     - stage advances to s6 (not current s5; current s6)

7) Time [6,7): operator_pickup(red) — stage s6 -> s7
   - Preconditions:
     - red is on the table (ontable red)
     - red is clear (clear red)
     - hand is empty (handempty)
     - current stage is s6 and succ(s6,s7)
   - Effects:
     - operator is holding red (holding red)
     - red is no longer on the table (not (ontable red))
     - red is not clear while held (not (clear red))
     - hand is not empty (not (handempty))
     - stage advances to s7 (not current s6; current s7)

8) Time [7,8): operator_stack(red, blue) — stage s7 -> s8
   - Preconditions:
     - operator is holding red (holding red)
     - blue is clear (clear blue)
     - current stage is s7 and succ(s7,s8)
   - Effects:
     - red is placed on blue (on red blue)
     - red becomes clear (clear red)
     - hand becomes empty (handempty)
     - operator no longer holds red (not (holding red))
     - blue becomes not clear (not (clear blue))
     - red is not on the table (not (ontable red))
     - stage advances to s8 (not current s7; current s8)

Final state after Time 8:
 - on red blue
 - on blue orange
 - on orange yellow
 - hand is empty
 - current stage s8

Goal check: The final state satisfies the goal predicates (red on blue, blue on orange, orange on yellow). All actions respect the single-hand constraint and the listed preconditions/effects from the specification.
