1) Time 0.0–1.0 (duration 1.0)
   Action: (planner-pick-up blue)
   Description: The planner picks up the block blue from the table.
   Preconditions checked: blue is on the table, blue is clear, hand is empty — all true in the initial state.
   Effects (after action): holding(blue); ¬ontable(blue); ¬clear(blue); ¬handempty.

2) Time 1.0–2.0 (duration 1.0)
   Action: (stacker-stack blue yellow)
   Description: The stacker stacks the held block blue onto block yellow.
   Preconditions checked: holding(blue) (from previous step), yellow is clear — both satisfied.

3) Time 2.0–3.0 (duration 1.0)
   Action: (planner-pick-up red)
   Description: The planner picks up the block red from the table.
   Preconditions checked: red is on the table, red is clear, hand is empty (handempty restored in step 2) — satisfied.

4) Time 3.0–4.0 (duration 1.0)
   Action: (stacker-stack red blue)
   Description: The stacker stacks the held block red onto block blue.
   Preconditions checked: holding(red) (from previous step), blue is clear (made clear in step 2) — satisfied.
   Effects (after action): on(red,blue); clear(red); ¬holding(red); handempty; ¬clear(blue).

Final state (after t = 4.0)
   - on(red,blue)
   - on(blue,yellow)
   - on(yellow,orange)
   - ontable(orange)
   - handempty

Goal status: All goal predicates are satisfied (red on blue, blue on yellow, yellow on orange, orange on table, hand empty).
Total plan cost: 4 (4 unit-cost actions).
