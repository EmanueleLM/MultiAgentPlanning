1) Time s0 → s1 (1 stage): unstack picker red from orange
- Agent: picker
- Preconditions satisfied: picker role; hand empty; red is clear; red is on orange.
- Effect summary: picker picks up red. red is no longer on orange, red is now held (holding red), orange becomes clear, hand is no longer empty.
- Relevant state after step: holding(red), clear(orange), not on(red,orange), handempty = false.

2) Time s1 → s2 (1 stage): putdown stacker red (to table)
- Agent: stacker
- Preconditions satisfied: stacker role; some agent is holding red (holding predicate is global/shared); current stage s1.
- Effect summary: red is put down on the table. red becomes ontable and clear, holding(red) is removed, hand becomes empty.
- Relevant state after step: ontable(red), clear(red), holding = none, handempty = true, clear(orange) remains true.

3) Time s2 → s3 (1 stage): pickup picker blue (from table)
- Agent: picker
- Preconditions satisfied: picker role; hand empty; blue is clear; blue is on the table.
- Effect summary: picker picks up blue. blue is no longer on the table, blue becomes held, blue is not clear while held, hand becomes not empty.
- Relevant state after step: holding(blue), not ontable(blue), clear(blue) = false, handempty = false, red ontable.

4) Time s3 → s4 (1 stage): stack stacker blue on red
- Agent: stacker
- Preconditions satisfied: stacker role; some agent is holding blue (holding predicate global); red is clear.
- Effect summary: blue is stacked onto red. on(blue, red) becomes true; red becomes not clear; blue becomes clear (top); holding(blue) removed; hand becomes empty.
- Relevant state after step: on(blue,red), clear(blue) = true, clear(red) = false, handempty = true.

5) Time s4 → s5 (1 stage): pickup picker yellow (from table)
- Agent: picker
- Preconditions satisfied: picker role; hand empty; yellow is clear; yellow is on the table.
- Effect summary: picker picks up yellow. yellow removed from table, held, not clear while held, hand not empty.
- Relevant state after step: holding(yellow), not ontable(yellow), clear(yellow) = false, handempty = false, on(blue,red) remains.

6) Time s5 → s6 (1 stage): stack stacker yellow on blue
- Agent: stacker
- Preconditions satisfied: stacker role; some agent is holding yellow; blue is clear.
- Effect summary: yellow is stacked onto blue. on(yellow,blue) becomes true; blue becomes not clear; yellow becomes clear; holding(yellow) removed; hand becomes empty.
- Relevant state after step: on(yellow,blue), clear(yellow) = true, clear(blue) = false, handempty = true, on(blue,red) remains.

7) Time s6 → s7 (1 stage): pickup picker orange (from table)
- Agent: picker
- Preconditions satisfied: picker role; hand empty; orange is clear; orange is on the table.
- Effect summary: picker picks up orange. orange removed from table, held, not clear while held, hand not empty.
- Relevant state after step: holding(orange), not ontable(orange), clear(orange) = false, handempty = false, stacks so far unchanged.

8) Time s7 → s8 (1 stage): stack stacker orange on yellow
- Agent: stacker
- Preconditions satisfied: stacker role; some agent is holding orange; yellow is clear.
- Effect summary: orange is stacked onto yellow. on(orange,yellow) becomes true; yellow becomes not clear; orange becomes clear; holding(orange) removed; hand becomes empty.
- Relevant state after step: on(orange,yellow), clear(orange) = true, clear(yellow) = false, handempty = true.

Final check (at stage s8): Goal achieved.
- Required goal relations: on(blue, red) — true; on(orange, yellow) — true; on(yellow, blue) — true.
- Hand state: empty.
- All steps matched the given plan and respect the explicit preconditions/effects (hand, clear, on, ontable, holding) per the specification.
