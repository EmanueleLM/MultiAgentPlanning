Sequential execution (each action takes 1 time unit; actions are executed one-at-a-time). Time shown as [start — end).

Initial state (before t=0): 
- on(red, blue), on(blue, orange), on(yellow, red), on-table(orange)
- clear(yellow), hand-empty
(Other atoms are false: no holding(...), etc.)

1) [t=0 — t=1] unstack yellow red
- What happens: take yellow off of red (pick up yellow from on top of red).
- Preconditions (satisfied): hand-empty; on(yellow, red); clear(yellow).
- Effects: holding(yellow) becomes true; clear(red) becomes true; hand-empty, on(yellow, red), clear(yellow) become false.

2) [t=1 — t=2] putdown yellow
- What happens: place the held yellow block onto the table.
- Preconditions (satisfied): holding(yellow).
- Effects: on-table(yellow) and clear(yellow) and hand-empty become true; holding(yellow) becomes false.

3) [t=2 — t=3] unstack red blue
- What happens: take red off of blue (pick up red from on top of blue).
- Preconditions (satisfied): hand-empty; on(red, blue); clear(red).
- Effects: holding(red) becomes true; clear(blue) becomes true; hand-empty, on(red, blue), clear(red) become false.

4) [t=3 — t=4] putdown red
- What happens: place the held red block onto the table.
- Preconditions (satisfied): holding(red).
- Effects: on-table(red) and clear(red) and hand-empty become true; holding(red) becomes false.

5) [t=4 — t=5] unstack blue orange
- What happens: take blue off of orange (pick up blue from on top of orange).
- Preconditions (satisfied): hand-empty; on(blue, orange); clear(blue).
- Effects: holding(blue) becomes true; clear(orange) becomes true; hand-empty, on(blue, orange), clear(blue) become false.

6) [t=5 — t=6] stack blue yellow
- What happens: place the held blue block on top of yellow.
- Preconditions (satisfied): holding(blue); clear(yellow).
- Effects: on(blue, yellow) and hand-empty and clear(blue) become true; holding(blue) and clear(yellow) become false.

7) [t=6 — t=7] pickup red
- What happens: pick up red from the table.
- Preconditions (satisfied): hand-empty; on-table(red); clear(red).
- Effects: holding(red) becomes true; hand-empty, on-table(red), clear(red) become false.

8) [t=7 — t=8] stack red orange
- What happens: place the held red block on top of orange.
- Preconditions (satisfied): holding(red); clear(orange).
- Effects: on(red, orange) and hand-empty and clear(red) become true; holding(red) and clear(orange) become false.

Final state (after t=8) — goal check:
- on(red, orange) is true.
- on(blue, yellow) is true.
Both goal atoms are satisfied.

Plan cost: 8 actions (unit cost each) — total cost = 8.
