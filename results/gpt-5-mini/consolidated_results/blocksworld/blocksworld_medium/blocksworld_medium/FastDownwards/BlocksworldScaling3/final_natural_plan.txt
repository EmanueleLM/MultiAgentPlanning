Plan (human-readable), following the given timestamps (s0 → s6). Each action occurs between the listed timestamp and the next (e.g., s0 → s1).

1) Time: s0 → s1
   Action: Unstack red from yellow
   Parameters: red (block) unstacked from yellow (block)
   Preconditions (must hold at s0): on(red, yellow); clear(red); handempty; now s0; succ s0 s1
   Immediate effects (true at s1): holding(red); clear(yellow); ¬on(red, yellow); ¬clear(red); ¬handempty; ¬ontable(red); now s1
   Notes: This picks red off yellow so red is in hand and yellow becomes clear.

2) Time: s1 → s2
   Action: Put down red (onto table)
   Parameters: red (block)
   Preconditions (must hold at s1): holding(red); now s1; succ s1 s2
   Immediate effects (true at s2): ontable(red); clear(red); handempty; ¬holding(red); now s2
   Notes: Places red on the table, freeing the hand and leaving red clear on the table.

3) Time: s2 → s3
   Action: Unstack yellow from orange
   Parameters: yellow (block) unstacked from orange (block)
   Preconditions (must hold at s2): on(yellow, orange); clear(yellow); handempty; now s2; succ s2 s3
   Immediate effects (true at s3): holding(yellow); clear(orange); ¬on(yellow, orange); ¬clear(yellow); ¬handempty; ¬ontable(yellow); now s3
   Notes: Takes yellow off orange; orange becomes clear and yellow is held.

4) Time: s3 → s4
   Action: Stack yellow onto red
   Parameters: yellow (block) placed on red (block)
   Preconditions (must hold at s3): holding(yellow); clear(red); now s3; succ s3 s4
   Immediate effects (true at s4): on(yellow, red); clear(yellow); handempty; ¬holding(yellow); ¬clear(red); ¬ontable(yellow); now s4
   Notes: Puts yellow on top of red, so red is no longer clear.

5) Time: s4 → s5
   Action: Pick up blue from the table
   Parameters: blue (block)
   Preconditions (must hold at s4): ontable(blue); clear(blue); handempty; now s4; succ s4 s5
   Immediate effects (true at s5): ¬ontable(blue); ¬clear(blue); ¬handempty; holding(blue); now s5
   Notes: Blue is picked up from the table and is now held.

6) Time: s5 → s6
   Action: Stack blue onto orange
   Parameters: blue (block) placed on orange (block)
   Preconditions (must hold at s5): holding(blue); clear(orange); now s5; succ s5 s6
   Immediate effects (true at s6): on(blue, orange); clear(blue); handempty; ¬holding(blue); ¬clear(orange); ¬ontable(blue); now s6
   Notes: Places blue on orange and finishes the sequence.

Final state (at s6) relevant to the goal:
- now s6 is true
- on(blue, orange) is true
- on(yellow, red) is true

Causal highlights (why actions are ordered):
- Step 1 (unstack red from yellow) makes yellow clear so yellow can be unstacked later (step 3).
- Step 2 (putdown red) returns the hand to empty and makes red clear so yellow can be stacked onto red (step 4).
- Step 3 (unstack yellow from orange) makes orange clear so blue can be stacked on orange in step 6.
- Steps 5–6 pick up blue and stack it on the now-clear orange.
This sequence exactly matches the provided plan and achieves the specified goal.
