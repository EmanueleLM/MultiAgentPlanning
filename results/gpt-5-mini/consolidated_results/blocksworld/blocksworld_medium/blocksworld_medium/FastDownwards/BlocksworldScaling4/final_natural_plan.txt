Initial state (stage s0):
- On the table: blue, yellow
- red is on yellow (on red yellow)
- orange is on blue (on orange blue)
- clear: red, orange
- hand: empty (handempty)
- current stage: s0

Note: each action advances the global stage by one (succ s_i s_{i+1}); treat that as a unit time-step.

Step 1 — unstack red from yellow (s0 → s1)
- Action: unstack(red, yellow)
- Preconditions (must hold at s0):
  - hand is empty
  - on(red, yellow)
  - clear(red)
  - red ≠ yellow (diff)
  - at-stage s0 and succ(s0, s1)
- Effects (applied when moving to s1):
  - add: holding(red), clear(yellow), at-stage s1
  - delete: handempty, on(red, yellow), clear(red), ontable(red) (red is no longer on the table)
- Resulting highlights at s1:
  - holding: red
  - hand: not empty
  - yellow becomes clear (top freed)
  - red is no longer on yellow nor on the table

Step 2 — putdown red onto the table (s1 → s2)
- Action: putdown(red)
- Preconditions (must hold at s1):
  - holding(red)
  - at-stage s1 and succ(s1, s2)
- Effects (applied when moving to s2):
  - add: ontable(red), clear(red), handempty, at-stage s2
  - delete: holding(red)
- Resulting highlights at s2:
  - red is on the table and clear
  - hand is empty

Step 3 — pickup yellow from the table (s2 → s3)
- Action: pickup(yellow)
- Preconditions (must hold at s2):
  - hand is empty
  - ontable(yellow)
  - clear(yellow)
  - at-stage s2 and succ(s2, s3)
- Effects (applied when moving to s3):
  - add: holding(yellow), at-stage s3
  - delete: handempty, ontable(yellow), clear(yellow)
- Resulting highlights at s3:
  - holding: yellow
  - hand: not empty
  - yellow is not on the table and is not clear while held

Step 4 — stack yellow onto orange (s3 → s4)
- Action: stack(yellow, orange)
- Preconditions (must hold at s3):
  - holding(yellow)
  - clear(orange)
  - yellow ≠ orange (diff)
  - at-stage s3 and succ(s3, s4)
- Effects (applied when moving to s4):
  - add: on(yellow, orange), clear(yellow), handempty, at-stage s4
  - delete: holding(yellow), clear(orange), ontable(yellow)
- Resulting highlights at s4:
  - yellow is stacked on orange (on yellow orange)
  - yellow is clear (top)
  - orange is no longer clear
  - hand is empty

Step 5 — pickup red from the table (s4 → s5)
- Action: pickup(red)
- Preconditions (must hold at s4):
  - hand is empty
  - ontable(red)
  - clear(red)
  - at-stage s4 and succ(s4, s5)
- Effects (applied when moving to s5):
  - add: holding(red), at-stage s5
  - delete: handempty, ontable(red), clear(red)
- Resulting highlights at s5:
  - holding: red
  - red is no longer on the table and is not clear while held

Step 6 — stack red onto yellow (s5 → s6)
- Action: stack(red, yellow)
- Preconditions (must hold at s5):
  - holding(red)
  - clear(yellow)
  - red ≠ yellow (diff)
  - at-stage s5 and succ(s5, s6)
- Effects (applied when moving to s6):
  - add: on(red, yellow), clear(red), handempty, at-stage s6
  - delete: holding(red), clear(yellow), ontable(red)
- Resulting highlights at s6:
  - red is on yellow (on red yellow)
  - yellow is on orange (on yellow orange) from Step 4
  - hand is empty
  - current stage: s6

Goal check at s6:
- on(red, yellow): true
- on(yellow, orange): true
- at-stage s6: true

All actions follow the domain preconditions and effects; the sequence achieves the specified goal in 6 stage-steps.
