Initial state (time 0.0, abstract time units):
- Facts:
  - (on orange red)
  - (on red yellow)
  - (on yellow blue)
  - (ontable blue)
  - (clear orange)
  - (handempty)

Plan (each action assumed duration = 1.0 time unit; timestamps are cumulative):

1) Time 0.0 → 1.0 — Action: (unstack orange red)
   - Why legal: preconditions hold:
     - (on orange red) is true
     - (clear orange) is true
     - (handempty) is true
   - Effects applied:
     - Add: (holding orange), (clear red)
     - Remove: (on orange red), (clear orange), (handempty)
   - Resulting state at time 1.0:
     - (holding orange)
     - (on red yellow)
     - (on yellow blue)
     - (ontable blue)
     - (clear red)
     - Note: orange is being held (not on anything and not clear)

2) Time 1.0 → 2.0 — Action: (putdown orange)
   - Why legal: precondition holds:
     - (holding orange) is true
   - Effects applied:
     - Add: (ontable orange), (clear orange), (handempty)
     - Remove: (holding orange)
   - Resulting state at time 2.0:
     - (ontable orange)
     - (ontable blue)
     - (on red yellow)
     - (clear orange)
     - (clear red)
     - (handempty)

3) Time 2.0 → 3.0 — Action: (unstack red yellow)
   - Why legal: preconditions hold:
     - (on red yellow) is true
     - (clear red) is true
     - (handempty) is true
   - Effects applied:
     - Add: (holding red), (clear yellow)
     - Remove: (on red yellow), (clear red), (handempty)
   - Resulting state at time 3.0:
     - (holding red)
     - (ontable orange)
     - (ontable blue)
     - (on yellow blue)
     - (clear yellow)
     - Note: red is being held

4) Time 3.0 → 4.0 — Action: (putdown red)
   - Why legal: precondition holds:
     - (holding red) is true
   - Effects applied:
     - Add: (ontable red), (clear red), (handempty)
     - Remove: (holding red)
   - Resulting state at time 4.0:
     - (ontable orange)
     - (ontable red)
     - (ontable blue)
     - (on yellow blue) — unchanged until explicitly moved
     - (clear yellow)
     - (clear red)
     - (clear orange)
     - (handempty)

5) Time 4.0 → 5.0 — Action: (unstack yellow blue)
   - Why legal: preconditions hold:
     - (on yellow blue) is true
     - (clear yellow) is true
     - (handempty) is true
   - Effects applied:
     - Add: (holding yellow), (clear blue)
     - Remove: (on yellow blue), (clear yellow), (handempty)
   - Resulting state at time 5.0:
     - (holding yellow)
     - (ontable orange)
     - (ontable red)
     - (ontable blue)
     - (clear blue)
     - (clear red)
     - (clear orange)
     - Note: yellow is being held

6) Time 5.0 → 6.0 — Action: (stack yellow orange)
   - Why legal: preconditions hold:
     - (holding yellow) is true
     - (clear orange) is true
   - Effects applied:
     - Add: (on yellow orange), (clear yellow), (handempty)
     - Remove: (holding yellow), (clear orange)
   - Resulting state at time 6.0:
     - (on yellow orange)          ← goal fact achieved
     - (ontable orange)            (orange remains on the table with yellow on top)
     - (ontable red)
     - (ontable blue)
     - (clear yellow)
     - (clear red)
     - (clear blue)
     - (handempty)

Final check:
- Goal (on yellow orange) is true in the final state at time 6.0.
- All actions respect the single-hand constraint and the stated preconditions/effects.
- Total plan cost (unit cost per action): 6.
