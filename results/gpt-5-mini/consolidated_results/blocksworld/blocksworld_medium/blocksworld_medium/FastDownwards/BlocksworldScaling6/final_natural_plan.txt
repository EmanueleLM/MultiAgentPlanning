Plan (unit-duration actions, start times in time units):

t = 0 (duration 1) — Action: Unstack(blue, yellow)
- Preconditions checked: on(blue, yellow), clear(blue), handempty
- Effects applied: remove on(blue, yellow); clear(yellow) becomes true; blue becomes not clear (because it is held); handempty becomes false; holding(blue) becomes true
- Resulting relevant facts after step: holding(blue), clear(yellow), hand not empty

t = 1 (duration 1) — Action: Stack(blue, red)
- Preconditions checked: holding(blue), clear(red)
- Effects applied: add on(blue, red); clear(blue) becomes true; clear(red) becomes false; handempty becomes true; holding(blue) becomes false; ontable(blue) becomes false
- Resulting relevant facts after step: on(blue, red), hand empty, red not clear

t = 2 (duration 1) — Action: Unstack(yellow, orange)
- Preconditions checked: on(yellow, orange), clear(yellow), handempty
- Effects applied: remove on(yellow, orange); clear(orange) becomes true; yellow becomes not clear (held); handempty becomes false; holding(yellow) becomes true
- Resulting relevant facts after step: holding(yellow), clear(orange), hand not empty

t = 3 (duration 1) — Action: PutDown(yellow)
- Preconditions checked: holding(yellow)
- Effects applied: ontable(yellow) becomes true; clear(yellow) becomes true; handempty becomes true; holding(yellow) becomes false
- Resulting relevant facts after step: ontable(yellow), clear(yellow), hand empty

t = 4 (duration 1) — Action: PickUp(orange)
- Preconditions checked: ontable(orange), clear(orange), handempty
- Effects applied: ontable(orange) removed; orange becomes not clear (held); handempty becomes false; holding(orange) becomes true
- Resulting relevant facts after step: holding(orange), orange not on table, hand not empty

t = 5 (duration 1) — Action: Stack(orange, blue)
- Preconditions checked: holding(orange), clear(blue)
- Effects applied: add on(orange, blue); clear(orange) becomes true; clear(blue) becomes false; handempty becomes true; holding(orange) becomes false; ontable(orange) becomes false
- Resulting relevant facts after step: on(orange, blue), hand empty

Final state relevant facts:
- on(blue, red) — achieved at t=1
- on(orange, blue) — achieved at t=5

Goal (on blue red) and (on orange blue) are satisfied.
Total cost (sum of unit durations) = 6 time units.
