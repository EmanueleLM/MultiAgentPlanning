Initial state (t=0):
- On table / clear facts: blue is on red; red on table; orange on table; yellow on table.
- Clear: blue, orange, yellow.
- Hand: empty (nobody is holding anything).
- Stage: s0.

Planned sequence (each action takes 1 time unit; stage advances s0→s1→...→s6). Actions are shown exactly as in the plan with agent, parameters, timestamp, preconditions (what must hold immediately before) and effects (what holds immediately after).

1) Time 0 → 1 (picker-unstack blue red s0 s1)
- Agent: picker
- Action: picker un-stacks blue from red (picker-unstack blue red s0 s1)
- Preconditions: blue is on red; blue is clear; hand is empty; current stage = s0.
- Effects: picker is holding blue; blue is no longer on red; red becomes clear; hand is no longer empty; blue is not clear; stage advances to s1.
- Resulting notable facts after step: holding(blue), clear(red), red on table, orange on table, yellow on table.

2) Time 1 → 2 (stacker-stack blue orange s1 s2)
- Agent: stacker
- Action: stack blue onto orange (stacker-stack blue orange s1 s2)
- Preconditions: holding(blue); orange is clear; current stage = s1.
- Effects: blue is on orange; orange is no longer clear; blue becomes clear; hand becomes empty (no one holding); blue is not on the table; stage advances to s2.
- Resulting notable facts after step: on(blue, orange), clear(blue), clear(red), hand empty, red on table, yellow on table.

3) Time 2 → 3 (picker-pick-from-table red s2 s3)
- Agent: picker
- Action: picker picks red up from the table (picker-pick-from-table red s2 s3)
- Preconditions: red is on the table; red is clear; hand is empty; current stage = s2.
- Effects: picker is holding red; red is no longer on the table; hand is not empty; red is not clear; stage advances to s3.
- Resulting notable facts after step: holding(red), on(blue, orange), hand not empty, blue on orange, yellow on table.

4) Time 3 → 4 (stacker-stack red blue s3 s4)
- Agent: stacker
- Action: stack red onto blue (stacker-stack red blue s3 s4)
- Preconditions: holding(red); blue is clear; current stage = s3.
- Effects: red is on blue; blue becomes not clear; red becomes clear; hand becomes empty; not holding red; red is not on the table; stage advances to s4.
- Resulting notable facts after step: on(red, blue), on(blue, orange), clear(red), hand empty, yellow on table.

5) Time 4 → 5 (picker-pick-from-table yellow s4 s5)
- Agent: picker
- Action: picker picks yellow up from the table (picker-pick-from-table yellow s4 s5)
- Preconditions: yellow is on the table; yellow is clear; hand is empty; current stage = s4.
- Effects: picker is holding yellow; yellow is no longer on the table; hand is not empty; yellow is not clear; stage advances to s5.
- Resulting notable facts after step: holding(yellow), on(red, blue), on(blue, orange), hand not empty.

6) Time 5 → 6 (stacker-stack yellow red s5 s6)
- Agent: stacker
- Action: stack yellow onto red (stacker-stack yellow red s5 s6)
- Preconditions: holding(yellow); red is clear; current stage = s5.
- Effects: yellow is on red; red becomes not clear; yellow becomes clear; hand becomes empty; not holding yellow; yellow not on the table; stage advances to s6.
- Resulting notable facts after step: on(yellow, red), on(red, blue), on(blue, orange), hand empty, stage = s6.

Final state (after t=6):
- on(red, blue)
- on(blue, orange)
- on(yellow, red)
- hand empty

Goal achieved exactly as required.
