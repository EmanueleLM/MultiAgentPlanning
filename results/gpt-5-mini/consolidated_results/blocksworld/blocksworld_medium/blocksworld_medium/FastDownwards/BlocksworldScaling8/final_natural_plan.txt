Initial state (time 0)
- Stack (bottom → top): yellow ← red ← blue ← orange
- orange is clear (top)
- hand is empty
- current stage: stage0

Plan (each action takes one stage step; timestamps shown as [t,t+1). Total cost = 6)

1) [t=0 → t=1] unstack(orange, blue, stage0 → stage1)
   - Action: pick the orange block up from on top of blue.
   - Preconditions satisfied: hand empty; orange is clear; orange is on blue; current-stage = stage0; succ(stage0, stage1) exists.
   - Effects: orange is no longer on blue; orange becomes not clear; blue becomes clear; hand is no longer empty; holding(orange) becomes true; current-stage becomes stage1.

2) [t=1 → t=2] put-down(orange, stage1 → stage2)
   - Action: put the held orange down onto the table.
   - Preconditions satisfied: holding(orange); current-stage = stage1; succ(stage1, stage2) exists.
   - Effects: orange is on the table; orange becomes clear; hand becomes empty; holding(orange) becomes false; current-stage becomes stage2.

3) [t=2 → t=3] unstack(blue, red, stage2 → stage3)
   - Action: pick the blue block up from on top of red.
   - Preconditions satisfied: hand empty; blue is clear (made clear in step 1); blue is on red; current-stage = stage2; succ(stage2, stage3) exists.
   - Effects: blue is no longer on red; red becomes clear; blue becomes not clear; hand becomes not empty; holding(blue) becomes true; current-stage becomes stage3.

4) [t=3 → t=4] put-down(blue, stage3 → stage4)
   - Action: put the held blue down onto the table.
   - Preconditions satisfied: holding(blue); current-stage = stage3; succ(stage3, stage4) exists.
   - Effects: blue is on the table; blue becomes clear; hand becomes empty; holding(blue) becomes false; current-stage becomes stage4.

5) [t=4 → t=5] unstack(red, yellow, stage4 → stage5)
   - Action: pick the red block up from on top of yellow.
   - Preconditions satisfied: hand empty; red is clear (made clear in step 3); red is on yellow; current-stage = stage4; succ(stage4, stage5) exists.
   - Effects: red is no longer on yellow; yellow becomes clear; red becomes not clear; hand becomes not empty; holding(red) becomes true; current-stage becomes stage5.

6) [t=5 → t=6] stack(red, blue, stage5 → stage6)
   - Action: stack the held red block onto the clear blue block.
   - Preconditions satisfied: holding(red); blue is clear (made clear in step 4); red and blue are distinct; current-stage = stage5; succ(stage5, stage6) exists.
   - Effects: red is on blue (goal achieved); holding(red) becomes false; hand becomes empty; blue becomes not clear; red becomes clear; current-stage becomes stage6.

Final state (time 6)
- red is on blue (goal satisfied)
- hand is empty
- current-stage = stage6
- Plan cost = 6 units.
