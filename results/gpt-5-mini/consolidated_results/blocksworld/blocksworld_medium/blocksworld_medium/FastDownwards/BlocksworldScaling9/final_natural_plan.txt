Initial state (time0):
- red on yellow
- blue on table
- orange on table
- red, blue, orange are clear
- hand is empty
- current time: time0

Plan (each action takes one time step: timeN -> timeN+1):

1) Unstack red from yellow (time0 → time1; duration = 1)
   - Preconditions satisfied at time0: on(red, yellow), clear(red), handempty.
   - Effects at time1:
     - red is no longer on yellow
     - yellow becomes clear
     - red becomes not clear
     - holding(red) = true
     - handempty = false
     - current time = time1

2) Put down red on the table (time1 → time2; duration = 1)
   - Preconditions at time1: holding(red).
   - Effects at time2:
     - ontable(red) = true
     - clear(red) = true
     - holding(red) = false
     - handempty = true
     - current time = time2

3) Pick up blue from the table (time2 → time3; duration = 1)
   - Preconditions at time2: ontable(blue), clear(blue), handempty.
   - Effects at time3:
     - ontable(blue) = false
     - clear(blue) = false
     - holding(blue) = true
     - handempty = false
     - current time = time3

4) Stack blue onto yellow (time3 → time4; duration = 1)
   - Preconditions at time3: holding(blue), clear(yellow).
   - Effects at time4:
     - on(blue, yellow) = true
     - clear(yellow) = false
     - clear(blue) = true
     - holding(blue) = false
     - handempty = true
     - current time = time4

5) Pick up red from the table (time4 → time5; duration = 1)
   - Preconditions at time4: ontable(red), clear(red), handempty.
   - Effects at time5:
     - ontable(red) = false
     - clear(red) = false
     - holding(red) = true
     - handempty = false
     - current time = time5

6) Stack red onto blue (time5 → time6; duration = 1)
   - Preconditions at time5: holding(red), clear(blue).
   - Effects at time6:
     - on(red, blue) = true
     - clear(blue) = false
     - clear(red) = true
     - holding(red) = false
     - handempty = true
     - current time = time6

Final state (time6) — Goal achieved:
- on(red, blue)
- on(blue, yellow)

Total plan cost: 6 (6 actions × unit cost).
