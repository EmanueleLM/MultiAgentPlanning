Summary: the plan executes 47 ordered steps. Each step takes one discrete stage (start -> next). I label stages as timestamps t0, t1, … corresponding to stage0, stage1, … stage47. I also note the executing role (chef or server) and the immediate resource effects when applicable (ingredient consumed; sandwich created/removed).

1) t0 -> t1 (duration 1 stage). Chef: make_sandwich_no_gluten sandw9 from bread7 + content9 for child1.
   - Result: sandw9 created in kitchen, marked gluten-free; bread7 and content9 are consumed.

2) t1 -> t2 (duration 1 stage). Chef: put_on_tray sandw9 onto tray1 for child1.
   - Result: sandw9 is placed on tray1 (no longer just in kitchen).

3) t2 -> t3 (duration 1 stage). Server: move_tray tray1 from kitchen to table1.
   - Result: tray1 now at table1.

4) t3 -> t4 (duration 1 stage). Server: move_tray tray1 from table1 to table3.
   - Result: tray1 now at table3.

5) t4 -> t5 (duration 1 stage). Server: serve_sandwich sandw9 to child1 from tray1 at table3.
