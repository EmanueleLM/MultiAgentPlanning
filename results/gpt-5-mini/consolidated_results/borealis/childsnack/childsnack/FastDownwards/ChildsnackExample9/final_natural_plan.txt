End state (after step 59): all children child1..child11 are served (served predicate true for each). All make/put/move/serve effects above reflect causal consumption: breads and contents used, sandwiches created, placed on trays, and consumed on serving; gluten_free sandwiches were used for gluten-allergic children (children 1,3,5,11) in the steps listed.

Notes on timing and causality:
- Each "make" step consumed the named bread & content and produced the named sandwich in the kitchen.
- Each "put_on_tray" moved a sandwich from in_kitchen to on_tray (tray had to be at kitchen at that moment).
- Each "move_tray" changed a tray's place as stated.
- Each "serve" removed the sandwich from the tray and marked the child served. Gluten-free sandwiches were used only for allergic children in the plan.

This sequence follows the provided plan exactly and documents the assumed durations and the causal effects for each step.
