Below is a human-readable, step-by-step trace of the provided plan. Each step matches the plan action-for-action, reports the action cost (used here as a time unit/duration where possible), and shows the cumulative total-cost (used as a running timestamp). When an action paints a tile I note the resulting painted color and that the tile is no longer clear.

Initial state (time 0, total-cost = 0):
- robot1 at tile_4-1 carrying color white

  - tile_2-2 white
  - tile_2-3 black
  - tile_3-1 white
  - tile_3-2 black
  - tile_3-3 white
  - tile_4-1 black
  - tile_4-2 white
  - tile_4-3 black
- Cumulative total-cost exactly matches plan comment: 108.

Notes:
- Each step above corresponds exactly to one action in the provided plan and lists the action cost (used as time duration) and the running total-cost as a timestamp.
- Painted tiles are reported as “painted” and considered not clear (robots cannot stand on painted tiles), consistent with the domain semantics.
