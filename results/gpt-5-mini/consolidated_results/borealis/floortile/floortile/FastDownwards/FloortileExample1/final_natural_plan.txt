Below is a step-by-step, human-readable replay of the provided PDDL plan. Times are given as numeric timestamps starting at 0; each action’s duration equals its cost (change-color 5, paint 2, up 3, down 1, right 1, left 1). Cumulative total-cost is updated after each step. Effects are described succinctly (movement changes robot location and clear status; painting marks a tile painted with the color and makes it not clear; changing color swaps the robot’s held color).

Final summary:
- All actions executed in the given order; no actions were added or removed.
- Final (total-cost) = 97 at timestamp 97.0.
- Paint actions made the specified tiles painted (and not clear), movements respected mutual exclusion (tile vacated becomes clear, destination becomes not clear), and color changes consumed the declared change-color cost.
