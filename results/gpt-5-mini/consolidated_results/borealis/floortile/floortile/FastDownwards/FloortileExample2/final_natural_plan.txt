Below is a human-readable, step-by-step execution of the given plan. Each step matches the plan exactly (no actions added or removed). I report the action, a short natural-language description, the numeric cost (used as the action duration), and the cumulative time (sum of costs up to and including that step). I also note the primary state change (robot movement or tile painted / robot color change) so you can follow progress.

Initial conditions (time = 0, total-cost = 0):
- robot1 at tile_2-3 carrying white
- robot2 at tile_1-1 carrying black
- Tiles tile_2-3 and tile_1-1 are occupied (not clear); all other tiles listed as clear and unpainted.
- Available colors: white, black

Final cumulative cost / time: 101

Final relevant facts (as achieved by the above steps):
- Painted tiles (color as listed):
  - tile_1-1 white
  - tile_1-2 black
  - tile_1-3 white
  - tile_2-1 black
  - tile_2-2 white
  - tile_2-3 black
  - tile_3-1 white
  - tile_3-2 black
  - tile_3-3 white
  - tile_4-1 black
  - tile_4-2 white
  - tile_4-3 black
- Total-cost = 101

Notes:
- Each action lists its numeric cost (domain costs used as action durations) and cumulative time is the running sum of those costs. This mirrors the numeric (total-cost) minimization in the specification.
- The sequence shown exactly mirrors the given plan; no steps were added or removed.
