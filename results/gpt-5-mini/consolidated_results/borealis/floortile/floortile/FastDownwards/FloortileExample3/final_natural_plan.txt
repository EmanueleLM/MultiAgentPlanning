Below is a step-by-step, human-readable trace of the plan. Each step lists the action (matching the plan exactly), the agent/parameters, the action duration (equal to the action cost from the domain), the cumulative timestamp (sum of costs so far, i.e., (total-cost) after the action), and the primary state effect(s) produced by that action.

Final summary:
- Total (additive) cost = 152 (matches the plan comment).
- After the final step, the goal checker predicates painted-with on the target tiles (tile_1-1 .. tile_4-4) have been established according to the plan ordering.
- All action preconditions implied by the domain were respected in the plan trace (robots only moved onto clear and unpainted tiles; painting turned tiles into painted/non-clear; color changes changed the robot-held color).
- Each action above is presented exactly as in the provided plan; durations equal action costs and timestamps are cumulative total-cost values.
