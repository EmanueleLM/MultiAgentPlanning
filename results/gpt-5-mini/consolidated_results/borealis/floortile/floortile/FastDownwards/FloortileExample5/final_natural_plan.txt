Final state summary
- Total-cost = 148 (matches plan summary)
- All goal tiles painted with the intended checkerboard pattern (tiles tile_1-1 through tile_4-4 are painted as required).
- All painted tiles are not clear (unoccupiable). The plan maintained the invariant that robots never attempted to move into a tile after it had been painted (paints always targeted tiles that were clear at the time of painting).
- Robot final positions: robot1 and robot2 occupy the last tiles they moved to (as indicated in the final steps); painted tiles remain painted and not clear.
