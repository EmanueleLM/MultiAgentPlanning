Each robot can move in four directions (up, down, right, left), change the color of paint it is carrying, and paint adjacent tiles. The domain also tracks the total cost of actions performed.\n\nThe actions defined in this domain include:\n\n1. change-color: This action allows a robot to change the color it has. The preconditions are that the robot currently has a color and the new color is available. The effect is that the robot no longer has the old color and now has the new color. This action increases the total cost by 5.\n\n2. paint-up: This action allows a robot to paint the tile above its current position. The preconditions are that the robot has a color, is at a certain tile, the tile above is clear, and the robot can move up. The effect is that the tile above is no longer clear and is now painted with the robot's color. This action increases the total cost by 2.\n\n3. paint-down: This action allows a robot to paint the tile below its current position. The preconditions are that the robot has a color, is at a certain tile, the tile below is clear, and the robot can move down. The effect is that the tile below is no longer clear and is now painted with the robot's color. This action increases the total cost by 2.\n\n4. up: This action allows a robot to move up to the tile above its current position. The preconditions are that the robot is at a certain tile, the tile above is clear, and the robot can move up. The effect is that the robot is now at the tile above, the tile it was previously at is now clear, and the tile it moved to is no longer clear. This action increases the total cost by 3.\n\n5. down: This action allows a robot to move down to the tile below its current position. The preconditions are that the robot is at a certain tile, the tile below is clear, and the robot can move down. The effect is that the robot is now at the tile below, the tile it was previously at is now clear, and the tile it moved to is no longer clear. This action increases the total cost by 1.\n\n6. right: This action allows a robot to move to the right to the tile adjacent to its current position. The preconditions are that the robot is at a certain tile, the tile to the right is clear, and the robot can move right. The effect is that the robot is now at the tile to the right, the tile it was previously at is now clear, and the tile it moved to is no longer clear. This action increases the total cost by 1.\n\n7. left: This action allows a robot to move to the left to the tile adjacent to its current position. The preconditions are that the robot is at a certain tile, the tile to the left is clear, and the robot can move left. The effect is that the robot is now at the tile to the left, the tile it was previously at is now clear, and the tile it moved to is no longer clear. This action increases the total cost by 1.\n\n</domain_nl>\n\n- The natural language description of the problem:\n<problem_nl>\nYou control a set of robots that can paint floor tiles with different colors. The robots can move in four directions: up, down, left, and right. They can paint with one color at a time and can change the color of their spray guns. Tiles can only be painted in the front (up) or behind (down) the robot, and once a tile is painted, no robot can stand on it.\n\nInitially:\n- There are fifteen tiles arranged in a 5x3 grid (tile_0-1 to tile_4-3).\n- Robot1 is at tile_4-1 and has a white spray gun.\n- Robot2 is at tile_4-3 and has a black spray gun.\n- The colors white and black are available for painting.\n- All tiles except tile_4-1 and tile_4-3 are clear and unpainted.\n- The tiles have directional relationships with each other, allowing the robots to move up, down, left, and right between adjacent tiles.\n\nYour goal is to paint the following tiles with the specified colors:\n- Tile tile_1-1 should be painted white.\n- Tile tile_1-2 should be painted black.\n- Tile tile_1-3 should be painted white.\n- Tile tile_2-1 should be painted black.\n- Tile tile_2-2 should be painted white.\n- Tile tile_2-3 should be painted black.\n- Tile tile_3-1 should be painted white.\n- Tile tile_3-2 should be painted black.\n- Tile tile_3-3 should be painted white.\n- Tile tile_4-1 should be painted black.\n- Tile tile_4-2 should be painted white.\n- Tile tile_4-3 should be painted black.\n\nAdditionally, you aim to minimize the total cost of the actions taken to achieve this goal.\n</problem_nl>\n\n- The PDDL problem template:\n<problem_pddl>\n(define (problem p01-432)\n (:domain floor-tile)\n (:objects tile_0-1 tile_0-2 tile_0-3 \n           tile_1-1 tile_1-2 tile_1-3 \n           tile_2-1 tile_2-2 tile_2-3 \n           tile_3-1 tile_3-2 tile_3-3 \n           tile_4-1 tile_4-2 tile_4-3 -

Each robot can move in four directions (up, down, right, left), change the color of paint it is carrying, and paint adjacent tiles. The domain also tracks the total cost of actions performed.\n\nThe actions defined in this domain include:\n\n1. change-color: This action allows a robot to change the color it has. The preconditions are that the robot currently has a color and the new color is available. The effect is that the robot no longer has the old color and now has the new color. This action increases the total cost by 5.\n\n2. paint-up: This action allows a robot to paint the tile above its current position. The preconditions are that the robot has a color, is at a certain tile, the tile above is clear, and the robot can move up. The effect is that the tile above is no longer clear and is now painted with the robot's color. This action increases the total cost by 2.\n\n3. paint-down: This action allows a robot to paint the tile below its current position. The preconditions are that the robot has a color, is at a certain tile, the tile below is clear, and the robot can move down. The effect is that the tile below is no longer clear and is now painted with the robot's color. This action increases the total cost by 2.\n\n4. up: This action allows a robot to move up to the tile above its current position. The preconditions are that the robot is at a certain tile, the tile above is clear, and the robot can move up. The effect is that the robot is now at the tile above, the tile it was previously at is now clear, and the tile it moved to is no longer clear. This action increases the total cost by 3.\n\n5. down: This action allows a robot to move down to the tile below its current position. The preconditions are that the robot is at a certain tile, the tile below is clear, and the robot can move down. The effect is that the robot is now at the tile below, the tile it was previously at is now clear, and the tile it moved to is no longer clear. This action increases the total cost by 1.\n\n6. right: This action allows a robot to move to the right to the tile adjacent to its current position. The preconditions are that the robot is at a certain tile, the tile to the right is clear, and the robot can move right. The effect is that the robot is now at the tile to the right, the tile it was previously at is now clear, and the tile it moved to is no longer clear. This action increases the total cost by 1.\n\n7. left: This action allows a robot to move to the left to the tile adjacent to its current position. The preconditions are that the robot is at a certain tile, the tile to the left is clear, and the robot can move left. The effect is that the robot is now at the tile to the left, the tile it was previously at is now clear, and the tile it moved to is no longer clear.

they free the origin tile and occupy the destination tile (clear toggles).\n- Painting actions require the tile to be clear and mark it painted with the given color and also mark it not clear (so no robot can stand on a painted tile thereafter).\n- Change-color requires the robot to currently have a color and the desired color to be available; it disallows changing to the same color (to avoid pointless costs).\n- Action costs are encoded using (increase (total-cost) ...). The metric is to minimize total-cost in the problem file.\n\nIf you want, I can:\n- Produce a version that allows changing to the same color (i.e., remove inequality),\n- Add additional static constraints or symmetry-breaking,\n- Run a small plan verification (if you provide a planner output) or generate a sample plan outline."

Each robot can move in four directions (up, down, right, left), change the color of paint it is carrying, and paint adjacent tiles. The domain also tracks the total cost of actions performed.\n\nThe actions defined in this domain include:\n\n1. change-color: This action allows a robot to change the color it has. The preconditions are that the robot currently has a color and the new color is available. The effect is that the robot no longer has the old color and now has the new color. This action increases the total cost by 5.\n\n2. paint-up: This action allows a robot to paint the tile above its current position. The preconditions are that the robot has a color, is at a certain tile, the tile above is clear, and the robot can move up. The effect is that the tile above is no longer clear and is now painted with the robot's color. This action increases the total cost by 2.\n\n3. paint-down: This action allows a robot to paint the tile below its current position. The preconditions are that the robot has a color, is at a certain tile, the tile below is clear, and the robot can move down. The effect is that the tile below is no longer clear and is now painted with the robot's color. This action increases the total cost by 2.\n\n4. up: This action allows a robot to move up to the tile above its current position. The preconditions are that the robot is at a certain tile, the tile above is clear, and the robot can move up. The effect is that the robot is now at the tile above, the tile it was previously at is now clear, and the tile it moved to is no longer clear. This action increases the total cost by 3.\n\n5. down: This action allows a robot to move down to the tile below its current position. The preconditions are that the robot is at a certain tile, the tile below is clear, and the robot can move down. The effect is that the robot is now at the tile below, the tile it was previously at is now clear, and the tile it moved to is no longer clear. This action increases the total cost by 1.\n\n6. right: This action allows a robot to move to the right to the tile adjacent to its current position. The preconditions are that the robot is at a certain tile, the tile to the right is clear, and the robot can move right. The effect is that the robot is now at the tile to the right, the tile it was previously at is now clear, and the tile it moved to is no longer clear. This action increases the total cost by 1.\n\n7. left: This action allows a robot to move to the left to the tile adjacent to its current position. The preconditions are that the robot is at a certain tile, the tile to the left is clear, and the robot can move left. The effect is that the robot is now at the tile to the left, the tile it was previously at is now clear, and the tile it moved to is no longer clear.

The robots can move in four directions: up, down, left, and right. They can paint with one color at a time and can change the color of their spray guns. Tiles can only be painted in the front (up) or behind (down) the robot, and once a tile is painted, no robot can stand on it.\n\nInitially:\n- There are fifteen tiles arranged in a 5x3 grid (tile_0-1 to tile_4-3).\n- Robot1 is at tile_2-3 and has a white spray gun.\n- Robot2 is at tile_1-1 and has a black spray gun.\n- The colors white and black are available for painting.\n- All tiles except tile_1-1 and tile_2-3 are clear and unpainted.\n- The tiles have directional relationships with each other, allowing the robots to move up, down, left, and right between adjacent tiles.\n\nYour goal is to paint the following tiles with the specified colors:\n- Tile tile_1-1 should be painted white.\n- Tile tile_1-2 should be painted black.\n- Tile tile_1-3 should be painted white.\n- Tile tile_2-1 should be painted black.\n- Tile tile_2-2 should be painted white.\n- Tile tile_2-3 should be painted black.\n- Tile tile_3-1 should be painted white.\n- Tile tile_3-2 should be painted black.\n- Tile tile_3-3 should be painted white.\n- Tile tile_4-1 should be painted black.\n- Tile tile_4-2 should be painted white.\n- Tile tile_4-3 should be painted black.\n\nAdditionally, you aim to minimize the total cost of the actions taken to achieve this goal.\n</problem_nl>\n\n- The PDDL problem template:\n<problem_pddl>\n(define (problem p03-432)\n (:domain floor-tile)\n (:objects tile_0-1 tile_0-2 tile_0-3 \n           tile_1-1 tile_1-2 tile_1-3 \n           tile_2-1 tile_2-2 tile_2-3 \n           tile_3-1 tile_3-2 tile_3-3 \n           tile_4-1 tile_4-2 tile_4-3 -

Each robot can move in four directions (up, down, right, left), change the color of paint it is carrying, and paint adjacent tiles. The domain also tracks the total cost of actions performed.\n\nThe actions defined in this domain include:\n\n1. change-color: This action allows a robot to change the color it has. The preconditions are that the robot currently has a color and the new color is available. The effect is that the robot no longer has the old color and now has the new color. This action increases the total cost by 5.\n\n2. paint-up: This action allows a robot to paint the tile above its current position. The preconditions are that the robot has a color, is at a certain tile, the tile above is clear, and the robot can move up. The effect is that the tile above is no longer clear and is now painted with the robot's color. This action increases the total cost by 2.\n\n3. paint-down: This action allows a robot to paint the tile below its current position. The preconditions are that the robot has a color, is at a certain tile, the tile below is clear, and the robot can move down. The effect is that the tile below is no longer clear and is now painted with the robot's color. This action increases the total cost by 2.\n\n4. up: This action allows a robot to move up to the tile above its current position. The preconditions are that the robot is at a certain tile, the tile above is clear, and the robot can move up. The effect is that the robot is now at the tile above, the tile it was previously at is now clear, and the tile it moved to is no longer clear. This action increases the total cost by 3.\n\n5. down: This action allows a robot to move down to the tile below its current position. The preconditions are that the robot is at a certain tile, the tile below is clear, and the robot can move down. The effect is that the robot is now at the tile below, the tile it was previously at is now clear, and the tile it moved to is no longer clear. This action increases the total cost by 1.\n\n6. right: This action allows a robot to move to the right to the tile adjacent to its current position. The preconditions are that the robot is at a certain tile, the tile to the right is clear, and the robot can move right. The effect is that the robot is now at the tile to the right, the tile it was previously at is now clear, and the tile it moved to is no longer clear. This action increases the total cost by 1.\n\n7. left: This action allows a robot to move to the left to the tile adjacent to its current position. The preconditions are that the robot is at a certain tile, the tile to the left is clear, and the robot can move left. The effect is that the robot is now at the tile to the left, the tile it was previously at is now clear, and the tile it moved to is no longer clear.

I will provide you with:\n- A natural language description of the domain.\n- A natural language description of the problem. \n- A PDDL domain template.\n- A PDDL problem template.\n\nHere are:\n- The natural language description of the domain:\n<domain_nl>\nThe floor-tile domain is designed for planning the actions of robots to paint floor tiles with two colors. Each robot can move in four directions (up, down, right, left), change the color of paint it is carrying, and paint adjacent tiles. The domain also tracks the total cost of actions performed.\n\nThe actions defined in this domain include:\n\n1. change-color: This action allows a robot to change the color it has. The preconditions are that the robot currently has a color and the new color is available. The effect is that the robot no longer has the old color and now has the new color. This action increases the total cost by 5.\n\n2. paint-up: This action allows a robot to paint the tile above its current position. The preconditions are that the robot has a color, is at a certain tile, the tile above is clear, and the robot can move up. The effect is that the tile above is no longer clear and is now painted with the robot's color. This action increases the total cost by 2.\n\n3. paint-down: This action allows a robot to paint the tile below its current position. The preconditions are that the robot has a color, is at a certain tile, the tile below is clear, and the robot can move down. The effect is that the tile below is no longer clear and is now painted with the robot's color. This action increases the total cost by 2.\n\n4. up: This action allows a robot to move up to the tile above its current position. The preconditions are that the robot is at a certain tile, the tile above is clear, and the robot can move up. The effect is that the robot is now at the tile above, the tile it was previously at is now clear, and the tile it moved to is no longer clear. This action increases the total cost by 3.\n\n5. down: This action allows a robot to move down to the tile below its current position. The preconditions are that the robot is at a certain tile, the tile below is clear, and the robot can move down. The effect is that the robot is now at the tile below, the tile it was previously at is now clear, and the tile it moved to is no longer clear. This action increases the total cost by 1.\n\n6. right: This action allows a robot to move to the right to the tile adjacent to its current position. The preconditions are that the robot is at a certain tile, the tile to the right is clear, and the robot can move right. The effect is that the robot is now at the tile to the right, the tile it was previously at is now clear, and the tile it moved to is no longer clear. This action increases the total cost by 1.\n\n7. left: This action allows a robot to move to the left to the tile adjacent to its current position. The preconditions are that the robot is at a certain tile, the tile to the left is clear, and the robot can move left. The effect is that the robot is now at the tile to the left, the tile it was previously at is now clear, and the tile it moved to is no longer clear. This action increases the total cost by 1.\n\n</domain_nl>\n\n- The natural language description of the problem:\n<problem_nl>\nYou control a set of robots that can paint floor tiles with different colors.

That enforces \"once a tile is painted, no robot can stand on it.\"\n- Change-color can change to any available color; changing to the same color is allowed but suboptimal (it will incur cost).\n- Action costs match your description: change-color +5, paint-up/down +2, up +3, down/right/left +1.\n\nYou can now run FastDownward on these two files (domain.pddl and problem.pddl).

I will provide you with:\n- A natural language description of the domain.\n- A natural language description of the problem. \n- A PDDL domain template.\n- A PDDL problem template.\n\nHere are:\n- The natural language description of the domain:\n<domain_nl>\nThe floor-tile domain is designed for planning the actions of robots to paint floor tiles with two colors. Each robot can move in four directions (up, down, right, left), change the color of paint it is carrying, and paint adjacent tiles. The domain also tracks the total cost of actions performed.\n\nThe actions defined in this domain include:\n\n1. change-color: This action allows a robot to change the color it has. The preconditions are that the robot currently has a color and the new color is available. The effect is that the robot no longer has the old color and now has the new color. This action increases the total cost by 5.\n\n2. paint-up: This action allows a robot to paint the tile above its current position. The preconditions are that the robot has a color, is at a certain tile, the tile above is clear, and the robot can move up. The effect is that the tile above is no longer clear and is now painted with the robot's color. This action increases the total cost by 2.\n\n3. paint-down: This action allows a robot to paint the tile below its current position. The preconditions are that the robot has a color, is at a certain tile, the tile below is clear, and the robot can move down. The effect is that the tile below is no longer clear and is now painted with the robot's color. This action increases the total cost by 2.\n\n4. up: This action allows a robot to move up to the tile above its current position. The preconditions are that the robot is at a certain tile, the tile above is clear, and the robot can move up. The effect is that the robot is now at the tile above, the tile it was previously at is now clear, and the tile it moved to is no longer clear. This action increases the total cost by 3.\n\n5. down: This action allows a robot to move down to the tile below its current position. The preconditions are that the robot is at a certain tile, the tile below is clear, and the robot can move down. The effect is that the robot is now at the tile below, the tile it was previously at is now clear, and the tile it moved to is no longer clear. This action increases the total cost by 1.\n\n6. right: This action allows a robot to move to the right to the tile adjacent to its current position. The preconditions are that the robot is at a certain tile, the tile to the right is clear, and the robot can move right. The effect is that the robot is now at the tile to the right, the tile it was previously at is now clear, and the tile it moved to is no longer clear. This action increases the total cost by 1.\n\n7. left: This action allows a robot to move to the left to the tile adjacent to its current position. The preconditions are that the robot is at a certain tile, the tile to the left is clear, and the robot can move left. The effect is that the robot is now at the tile to the left, the tile it was previously at is now clear, and the tile it moved to is no longer clear.

I will provide you with:\n- A natural language description of the domain.\n- A natural language description of the problem. \n- A PDDL domain template.\n- A PDDL problem template.\n\nHere are:\n- The natural language description of the domain:\n<domain_nl>\nThe floor-tile domain is designed for planning the actions of robots to paint floor tiles with two colors. Each robot can move in four directions (up, down, right, left), change the color of paint it is carrying, and paint adjacent tiles. The domain also tracks the total cost of actions performed.\n\nThe actions defined in this domain include:\n\n1. change-color: This action allows a robot to change the color it has. The preconditions are that the robot currently has a color and the new color is available. The effect is that the robot no longer has the old color and now has the new color. This action increases the total cost by 5.\n\n2. paint-up: This action allows a robot to paint the tile above its current position. The preconditions are that the robot has a color, is at a certain tile, the tile above is clear, and the robot can move up. The effect is that the tile above is no longer clear and is now painted with the robot's color. This action increases the total cost by 2.\n\n3. paint-down: This action allows a robot to paint the tile below its current position. The preconditions are that the robot has a color, is at a certain tile, the tile below is clear, and the robot can move down. The effect is that the tile below is no longer clear and is now painted with the robot's color. This action increases the total cost by 2.\n\n4. up: This action allows a robot to move up to the tile above its current position. The preconditions are that the robot is at a certain tile, the tile above is clear, and the robot can move up. The effect is that the robot is now at the tile above, the tile it was previously at is now clear, and the tile it moved to is no longer clear. This action increases the total cost by 3.\n\n5. down: This action allows a robot to move down to the tile below its current position. The preconditions are that the robot is at a certain tile, the tile below is clear, and the robot can move down. The effect is that the robot is now at the tile below, the tile it was previously at is now clear, and the tile it moved to is no longer clear. This action increases the total cost by 1.\n\n6. right: This action allows a robot to move to the right to the tile adjacent to its current position. The preconditions are that the robot is at a certain tile, the tile to the right is clear, and the robot can move right. The effect is that the robot is now at the tile to the right, the tile it was previously at is now clear, and the tile it moved to is no longer clear. This action increases the total cost by 1.\n\n7. left: This action allows a robot to move to the left to the tile adjacent to its current position. The preconditions are that the robot is at a certain tile, the tile to the left is clear, and the robot can move left. The effect is that the robot is now at the tile to the left, the tile it was previously at is now clear, and the tile it moved to is no longer clear.

I will provide you with:\n- A natural language description of the domain.\n- A natural language description of the problem. \n- A PDDL domain template.\n- A PDDL problem template.\n\nHere are:\n- The natural language description of the domain:\n<domain_nl>\nThe floor-tile domain is designed for planning the actions of robots to paint floor tiles with two colors. Each robot can move in four directions (up, down, right, left), change the color of paint it is carrying, and paint adjacent tiles. The domain also tracks the total cost of actions performed.\n\nThe actions defined in this domain include:\n\n1. change-color: This action allows a robot to change the color it has. The preconditions are that the robot currently has a color and the new color is available. The effect is that the robot no longer has the old color and now has the new color. This action increases the total cost by 5.\n\n2. paint-up: This action allows a robot to paint the tile above its current position. The preconditions are that the robot has a color, is at a certain tile, the tile above is clear, and the robot can move up. The effect is that the tile above is no longer clear and is now painted with the robot's color. This action increases the total cost by 2.\n\n3. paint-down: This action allows a robot to paint the tile below its current position. The preconditions are that the robot has a color, is at a certain tile, the tile below is clear, and the robot can move down. The effect is that the tile below is no longer clear and is now painted with the robot's color. This action increases the total cost by 2.\n\n4. up: This action allows a robot to move up to the tile above its current position. The preconditions are that the robot is at a certain tile, the tile above is clear, and the robot can move up. The effect is that the robot is now at the tile above, the tile it was previously at is now clear, and the tile it moved to is no longer clear. This action increases the total cost by 3.\n\n5. down: This action allows a robot to move down to the tile below its current position. The preconditions are that the robot is at a certain tile, the tile below is clear, and the robot can move down. The effect is that the robot is now at the tile below, the tile it was previously at is now clear, and the tile it moved to is no longer clear. This action increases the total cost by 1.\n\n6. right: This action allows a robot to move to the right to the tile adjacent to its current position. The preconditions are that the robot is at a certain tile, the tile to the right is clear, and the robot can move right. The effect is that the robot is now at the tile to the right, the tile it was previously at is now clear, and the tile it moved to is no longer clear. This action increases the total cost by 1.\n\n7. left: This action allows a robot to move to the left to the tile adjacent to its current position. The preconditions are that the robot is at a certain tile, the tile to the left is clear, and the robot can move left. The effect is that the robot is now at the tile to the left, the tile it was previously at is now clear, and the tile it moved to is no longer clear. This action increases the total cost by 1.\n\n</domain_nl>\n\n- The natural language description of the problem:\n<problem_nl>\nYou control a set of robots that can paint floor tiles with different colors.

I will provide you with:\n- A natural language description of the domain.\n- A natural language description of the problem. \n- A PDDL domain template.\n- A PDDL problem template.\n\nHere are:\n- The natural language description of the domain:\n<domain_nl>\nThe floor-tile domain is designed for planning the actions of robots to paint floor tiles with two colors. Each robot can move in four directions (up, down, right, left), change the color of paint it is carrying, and paint adjacent tiles. The domain also tracks the total cost of actions performed.\n\nThe actions defined in this domain include:\n\n1. change-color: This action allows a robot to change the color it has. The preconditions are that the robot currently has a color and the new color is available. The effect is that the robot no longer has the old color and now has the new color. This action increases the total cost by 5.\n\n2. paint-up: This action allows a robot to paint the tile above its current position. The preconditions are that the robot has a color, is at a certain tile, the tile above is clear, and the robot can move up. The effect is that the tile above is no longer clear and is now painted with the robot's color. This action increases the total cost by 2.\n\n3. paint-down: This action allows a robot to paint the tile below its current position. The preconditions are that the robot has a color, is at a certain tile, the tile below is clear, and the robot can move down. The effect is that the tile below is no longer clear and is now painted with the robot's color. This action increases the total cost by 2.\n\n4. up: This action allows a robot to move up to the tile above its current position. The preconditions are that the robot is at a certain tile, the tile above is clear, and the robot can move up. The effect is that the robot is now at the tile above, the tile it was previously at is now clear, and the tile it moved to is no longer clear. This action increases the total cost by 3.\n\n5. down: This action allows a robot to move down to the tile below its current position. The preconditions are that the robot is at a certain tile, the tile below is clear, and the robot can move down. The effect is that the robot is now at the tile below, the tile it was previously at is now clear, and the tile it moved to is no longer clear. This action increases the total cost by 1.\n\n6. right: This action allows a robot to move to the right to the tile adjacent to its current position. The preconditions are that the robot is at a certain tile, the tile to the right is clear, and the robot can move right. The effect is that the robot is now at the tile to the right, the tile it was previously at is now clear, and the tile it moved to is no longer clear. This action increases the total cost by 1.\n\n7. left: This action allows a robot to move to the left to the tile adjacent to its current position. The preconditions are that the robot is at a certain tile, the tile to the left is clear, and the robot can move left. The effect is that the robot is now at the tile to the left, the tile it was previously at is now clear, and the tile it moved to is no longer clear.

Each robot can move in four directions (up, down, right, left), change the color of paint it is carrying, and paint adjacent tiles. The domain also tracks the total cost of actions performed.\n\nThe actions defined in this domain include:\n\n1. change-color: This action allows a robot to change the color it has. The preconditions are that the robot currently has a color and the new color is available. The effect is that the robot no longer has the old color and now has the new color. This action increases the total cost by 5.\n\n2. paint-up: This action allows a robot to paint the tile above its current position. The preconditions are that the robot has a color, is at a certain tile, the tile above is clear, and the robot can move up. The effect is that the tile above is no longer clear and is now painted with the robot's color. This action increases the total cost by 2.\n\n3. paint-down: This action allows a robot to paint the tile below its current position. The preconditions are that the robot has a color, is at a certain tile, the tile below is clear, and the robot can move down. The effect is that the tile below is no longer clear and is now painted with the robot's color. This action increases the total cost by 2.\n\n4. up: This action allows a robot to move up to the tile above its current position. The preconditions are that the robot is at a certain tile, the tile above is clear, and the robot can move up. The effect is that the robot is now at the tile above, the tile it was previously at is now clear, and the tile it moved to is no longer clear. This action increases the total cost by 3.\n\n5. down: This action allows a robot to move down to the tile below its current position. The preconditions are that the robot is at a certain tile, the tile below is clear, and the robot can move down. The effect is that the robot is now at the tile below, the tile it was previously at is now clear, and the tile it moved to is no longer clear. This action increases the total cost by 1.\n\n6. right: This action allows a robot to move to the right to the tile adjacent to its current position. The preconditions are that the robot is at a certain tile, the tile to the right is clear, and the robot can move right. The effect is that the robot is now at the tile to the right, the tile it was previously at is now clear, and the tile it moved to is no longer clear. This action increases the total cost by 1.\n\n7. left: This action allows a robot to move to the left to the tile adjacent to its current position. The preconditions are that the robot is at a certain tile, the tile to the left is clear, and the robot can move left. The effect is that the robot is now at the tile to the left, the tile it was previously at is now clear, and the tile it moved to is no longer clear. This action increases the total cost by 1.\n\n</domain_nl>\n\n- The natural language description of the problem:\n<problem_nl>\nYou control two robots that can paint floor tiles with different colors.

I will provide you with:\n- A natural language description of the domain.\n- A natural language description of the problem. \n- A PDDL domain template.\n- A PDDL problem template.\n\nHere are:\n- The natural language description of the domain:\n<domain_nl>\nThe floor-tile domain is designed for planning the actions of robots to paint floor tiles with two colors. Each robot can move in four directions (up, down, right, left), change the color of paint it is carrying, and paint adjacent tiles. The domain also tracks the total cost of actions performed.\n\nThe actions defined in this domain include:\n\n1. change-color: This action allows a robot to change the color it has. The preconditions are that the robot currently has a color and the new color is available. The effect is that the robot no longer has the old color and now has the new color. This action increases the total cost by 5.\n\n2. paint-up: This action allows a robot to paint the tile above its current position. The preconditions are that the robot has a color, is at a certain tile, the tile above is clear, and the robot can move up. The effect is that the tile above is no longer clear and is now painted with the robot's color. This action increases the total cost by 2.\n\n3. paint-down: This action allows a robot to paint the tile below its current position. The preconditions are that the robot has a color, is at a certain tile, the tile below is clear, and the robot can move down. The effect is that the tile below is no longer clear and is now painted with the robot's color. This action increases the total cost by 2.\n\n4. up: This action allows a robot to move up to the tile above its current position. The preconditions are that the robot is at a certain tile, the tile above is clear, and the robot can move up. The effect is that the robot is now at the tile above, the tile it was previously at is now clear, and the tile it moved to is no longer clear. This action increases the total cost by 3.\n\n5. down: This action allows a robot to move down to the tile below its current position. The preconditions are that the robot is at a certain tile, the tile below is clear, and the robot can move down. The effect is that the robot is now at the tile below, the tile it was previously at is now clear, and the tile it moved to is no longer clear. This action increases the total cost by 1.\n\n6. right: This action allows a robot to move to the right to the tile adjacent to its current position. The preconditions are that the robot is at a certain tile, the tile to the right is clear, and the robot can move right. The effect is that the robot is now at the tile to the right, the tile it was previously at is now clear, and the tile it moved to is no longer clear. This action increases the total cost by 1.\n\n7. left: This action allows a robot to move to the left to the tile adjacent to its current position. The preconditions are that the robot is at a certain tile, the tile to the left is clear, and the robot can move left. The effect is that the robot is now at the tile to the left, the tile it was previously at is now clear, and the tile it moved to is no longer clear. This action increases the total cost by 1.\n\n</domain_nl>\n\n- The natural language description of the problem:\n<problem_nl>\nYou control two robots that can paint floor tiles with different colors.

The robots can move in four directions: up, down, left, and right. They can paint with one color at a time and can change the color of their spray guns. Tiles can only be painted in the front (up) or behind (down) the robot, and once a tile is painted, no robot can stand on it.\n\nInitially:\n- There are twenty-four tiles arranged in a 6x4 grid (tile_0-1 to tile_5-4).\n- Robot1 is at tile_1-3 and has a white spray gun.\n- Robot2 is at tile_5-2 and has a black spray gun.\n- The colors white and black are available for painting.\n- All tiles are clear and unpainted.\n- The tiles have directional relationships with each other, allowing the robots to move up, down, left, and right between adjacent tiles.\n\nYour goal is to paint the following tiles with the specified colors:\n- Tile tile_1-1 should be painted white.\n- Tile tile_1-2 should be painted black.\n- Tile tile_1-3 should be painted white.\n- Tile tile_1-4 should be painted black.\n- Tile tile_2-1 should be painted black.\n- Tile tile_2-2 should be painted white.\n- Tile tile_2-3 should be painted black.\n- Tile tile_2-4 should be painted white.\n- Tile tile_3-1 should be painted white.\n- Tile tile_3-2 should be painted black.\n- Tile tile_3-3 should be painted white.\n- Tile tile_3-4 should be painted black.\n- Tile tile_4-1 should be painted black.\n- Tile tile_4-2 should be painted white.\n- Tile tile_4-3 should be painted black.\n- Tile tile_4-4 should be painted white.\n- Tile tile_5-1 should be painted white.\n- Tile tile_5-2 should be painted black.\n- Tile tile_5-3 should be painted white.\n- Tile tile_5-4 should be painted black.\n\nAdditionally, you aim to minimize the total cost of the actions taken to achieve this goal.\n</problem_nl>\n\n- The PDDL problem template:\n<problem_pddl>\n(define (problem p11-542)\n (:domain floor-tile)\n (:objects tile_0-1 tile_0-2 tile_0-3 tile_0-4 \n           tile_1-1 tile_1-2 tile_1-3 tile_1-4 \n           tile_2-1 tile_2-2 tile_2-3 tile_2-4 \n           tile_3-1 tile_3-2 tile_3-3 tile_3-4 \n           tile_4-1 tile_4-2 tile_4-3 tile_4-4 \n           tile_5-1 tile_5-2 tile_5-3 tile_5-4 -

Tiles can only be painted in the front (up) or behind (down) the robot, and once a tile is painted, no robot can stand on it.\n\nInitially:\n- There are twenty-four tiles arranged in a 6x4 grid (tile_0-1 to tile_5-4).\n- Robot1 is at tile_1-3 and has a white spray gun.\n- Robot2 is at tile_5-2 and has a black spray gun.\n- The colors white and black are available for painting.\n- All tiles are clear and unpainted.\n- The tiles have directional relationships with each other, allowing the robots to move up, down, left, and right between adjacent tiles.\n\nYour goal is to paint the following tiles with the specified colors:\n- Tile tile_1-1 should be painted white.\n- Tile tile_1-2 should be painted black.\n- Tile tile_1-3 should be painted white.\n- Tile tile_1-4 should be painted black.\n- Tile tile_2-1 should be painted black.\n- Tile tile_2-2 should be painted white.\n- Tile tile_2-3 should be painted black.\n- Tile tile_2-4 should be painted white.\n- Tile tile_3-1 should be painted white.\n- Tile tile_3-2 should be painted black.\n- Tile tile_3-3 should be painted white.\n- Tile tile_3-4 should be painted black.\n- Tile tile_4-1 should be painted black.\n- Tile tile_4-2 should be painted white.\n- Tile tile_4-3 should be painted black.\n- Tile tile_4-4 should be painted white.\n- Tile tile_5-1 should be painted white.\n- Tile tile_5-2 should be painted black.\n- Tile tile_5-3 should be painted white.\n- Tile tile_5-4 should be painted black.\n\nAdditionally, you aim to minimize the total cost of the actions taken to achieve this goal.\n</problem_nl>\n\n- The PDDL problem template:\n<problem_pddl>\n(define (problem p11-542)\n (:domain floor-tile)\n (:objects tile_0-1 tile_0-2 tile_0-3 tile_0-4 \n           tile_1-1 tile_1-2 tile_1-3 tile_1-4 \n           tile_2-1 tile_2-2 tile_2-3 tile_2-4 \n           tile_3-1 tile_3-2 tile_3-3 tile_3-4 \n           tile_4-1 tile_4-2 tile_4-3 tile_4-4 \n           tile_5-1 tile_5-2 tile_5-3 tile_5-4 -

Each robot can move in four directions (up, down, right, left), change the color of paint it is carrying, and paint adjacent tiles. The domain also tracks the total cost of actions performed.\n\nThe actions defined in this domain include:\n\n1. change-color: This action allows a robot to change the color it has. The preconditions are that the robot currently has a color and the new color is available. The effect is that the robot no longer has the old color and now has the new color. This action increases the total cost by 5.\n\n2. paint-up: This action allows a robot to paint the tile above its current position. The preconditions are that the robot has a color, is at a certain tile, the tile above is clear, and the robot can move up. The effect is that the tile above is no longer clear and is now painted with the robot's color. This action increases the total cost by 2.\n\n3. paint-down: This action allows a robot to paint the tile below its current position. The preconditions are that the robot has a color, is at a certain tile, the tile below is clear, and the robot can move down. The effect is that the tile below is no longer clear and is now painted with the robot's color. This action increases the total cost by 2.\n\n4. up: This action allows a robot to move up to the tile above its current position. The preconditions are that the robot is at a certain tile, the tile above is clear, and the robot can move up. The effect is that the robot is now at the tile above, the tile it was previously at is now clear, and the tile it moved to is no longer clear. This action increases the total cost by 3.\n\n5. down: This action allows a robot to move down to the tile below its current position. The preconditions are that the robot is at a certain tile, the tile below is clear, and the robot can move down. The effect is that the robot is now at the tile below, the tile it was previously at is now clear, and the tile it moved to is no longer clear. This action increases the total cost by 1.\n\n6. right: This action allows a robot to move to the right to the tile adjacent to its current position. The preconditions are that the robot is at a certain tile, the tile to the right is clear, and the robot can move right. The effect is that the robot is now at the tile to the right, the tile it was previously at is now clear, and the tile it moved to is no longer clear. This action increases the total cost by 1.\n\n7. left: This action allows a robot to move to the left to the tile adjacent to its current position. The preconditions are that the robot is at a certain tile, the tile to the left is clear, and the robot can move left. The effect is that the robot is now at the tile to the left, the tile it was previously at is now clear, and the tile it moved to is no longer clear.

Each robot can move in four directions (up, down, right, left), change the color of paint it is carrying, and paint adjacent tiles. The domain also tracks the total cost of actions performed.\n\nThe actions defined in this domain include:\n\n1. change-color: This action allows a robot to change the color it has. The preconditions are that the robot currently has a color and the new color is available. The effect is that the robot no longer has the old color and now has the new color. This action increases the total cost by 5.\n\n2. paint-up: This action allows a robot to paint the tile above its current position. The preconditions are that the robot has a color, is at a certain tile, the tile above is clear, and the robot can move up. The effect is that the tile above is no longer clear and is now painted with the robot's color. This action increases the total cost by 2.\n\n3. paint-down: This action allows a robot to paint the tile below its current position. The preconditions are that the robot has a color, is at a certain tile, the tile below is clear, and the robot can move down. The effect is that the tile below is no longer clear and is now painted with the robot's color. This action increases the total cost by 2.\n\n4. up: This action allows a robot to move up to the tile above its current position. The preconditions are that the robot is at a certain tile, the tile above is clear, and the robot can move up. The effect is that the robot is now at the tile above, the tile it was previously at is now clear, and the tile it moved to is no longer clear. This action increases the total cost by 3.\n\n5. down: This action allows a robot to move down to the tile below its current position. The preconditions are that the robot is at a certain tile, the tile below is clear, and the robot can move down. The effect is that the robot is now at the tile below, the tile it was previously at is now clear, and the tile it moved to is no longer clear. This action increases the total cost by 1.\n\n6. right: This action allows a robot to move to the right to the tile adjacent to its current position. The preconditions are that the robot is at a certain tile, the tile to the right is clear, and the robot can move right. The effect is that the robot is now at the tile to the right, the tile it was previously at is now clear, and the tile it moved to is no longer clear. This action increases the total cost by 1.\n\n7. left: This action allows a robot to move to the left to the tile adjacent to its current position. The preconditions are that the robot is at a certain tile, the tile to the left is clear, and the robot can move left. The effect is that the robot is now at the tile to the left, the tile it was previously at is now clear, and the tile it moved to is no longer clear.

I will provide you with:\n- A natural language description of the domain.\n- A natural language description of the problem. \n- A PDDL domain template.\n- A PDDL problem template.\n\nHere are:\n- The natural language description of the domain:\n<domain_nl>\nThe floor-tile domain is designed for planning the actions of robots to paint floor tiles with two colors. Each robot can move in four directions (up, down, right, left), change the color of paint it is carrying, and paint adjacent tiles. The domain also tracks the total cost of actions performed.\n\nThe actions defined in this domain include:\n\n1. change-color: This action allows a robot to change the color it has. The preconditions are that the robot currently has a color and the new color is available. The effect is that the robot no longer has the old color and now has the new color. This action increases the total cost by 5.\n\n2. paint-up: This action allows a robot to paint the tile above its current position. The preconditions are that the robot has a color, is at a certain tile, the tile above is clear, and the robot can move up. The effect is that the tile above is no longer clear and is now painted with the robot's color. This action increases the total cost by 2.\n\n3. paint-down: This action allows a robot to paint the tile below its current position. The preconditions are that the robot has a color, is at a certain tile, the tile below is clear, and the robot can move down. The effect is that the tile below is no longer clear and is now painted with the robot's color. This action increases the total cost by 2.\n\n4. up: This action allows a robot to move up to the tile above its current position. The preconditions are that the robot is at a certain tile, the tile above is clear, and the robot can move up. The effect is that the robot is now at the tile above, the tile it was previously at is now clear, and the tile it moved to is no longer clear. This action increases the total cost by 3.\n\n5. down: This action allows a robot to move down to the tile below its current position. The preconditions are that the robot is at a certain tile, the tile below is clear, and the robot can move down. The effect is that the robot is now at the tile below, the tile it was previously at is now clear, and the tile it moved to is no longer clear. This action increases the total cost by 1.\n\n6. right: This action allows a robot to move to the right to the tile adjacent to its current position. The preconditions are that the robot is at a certain tile, the tile to the right is clear, and the robot can move right. The effect is that the robot is now at the tile to the right, the tile it was previously at is now clear, and the tile it moved to is no longer clear. This action increases the total cost by 1.\n\n7. left: This action allows a robot to move to the left to the tile adjacent to its current position. The preconditions are that the robot is at a certain tile, the tile to the left is clear, and the robot can move left. The effect is that the robot is now at the tile to the left, the tile it was previously at is now clear, and the tile it moved to is no longer clear. This action increases the total cost by 1.\n\n</domain_nl>\n\n- The natural language description of the problem:\n<problem_nl>\nYou control a set of robots that can paint floor tiles with different colors. The robots can move in four directions: up, down, left, and right. They can paint with one color at a time and can change the color of their spray guns. Tiles can only be painted in the front (up) or behind (down) the robot, and once a tile is painted, no robot can stand on it.\n\nInitially:\n- There are twenty-five tiles arranged in a 5x5 grid (tile_0-1 to tile_5-5).\n- Robot1 is at tile_0-5 and has a white spray gun.\n- Robot2 is at tile_3-3 and has a black spray gun.\n- The colors white and black are available for painting.\n- All tiles except tile_3-3 are clear and unpainted.\n- The tiles have directional relationships with each other, allowing the robots to move up, down, left, and right between adjacent tiles.\n\nYour goal is to paint the following tiles with the specified colors in a checkerboard pattern:\n- The odd-numbered tiles in row 1 should be painted white, and the even-numbered tiles should be painted black.\n- The odd-numbered tiles in row 2 should be painted black, and the even-numbered tiles should be painted white.\n- The odd-numbered tiles in row 3 should be painted white, and the even-numbered tiles should be painted black.\n- The odd-numbered tiles in row 4 should be painted black, and the even-numbered tiles should be painted white.\n- The odd-numbered tiles in row 5 should be painted white, and the even-numbered tiles should be painted black.\n\nAdditionally, you aim to minimize the total cost of the actions taken to achieve this goal.\n</problem_nl>\n\n- The PDDL problem template:\n<problem_pddl>\n(define (problem p13-552)\n (:domain floor-tile)\n (:objects tile_0-1 tile_0-2 tile_0-3 tile_0-4 tile_0-5 \n           tile_1-1 tile_1-2 tile_1-3 tile_1-4 tile_1-5 \n           tile_2-1 tile_2-2 tile_2-3 tile_2-4 tile_2-5 \n           tile_3-1 tile_3-2 tile_3-3 tile_3-4 tile_3-5 \n           tile_4-1 tile_4-2 tile_4-3 tile_4-4 tile_4-5 \n           tile_5-1 tile_5-2 tile_5-3 tile_5-4 tile_5-5 -

Each robot can move in four directions (up, down, right, left), change the color of paint it is carrying, and paint adjacent tiles. The domain also tracks the total cost of actions performed.\n\nThe actions defined in this domain include:\n\n1. change-color: This action allows a robot to change the color it has. The preconditions are that the robot currently has a color and the new color is available. The effect is that the robot no longer has the old color and now has the new color. This action increases the total cost by 5.\n\n2. paint-up: This action allows a robot to paint the tile above its current position. The preconditions are that the robot has a color, is at a certain tile, the tile above is clear, and the robot can move up. The effect is that the tile above is no longer clear and is now painted with the robot's color. This action increases the total cost by 2.\n\n3. paint-down: This action allows a robot to paint the tile below its current position. The preconditions are that the robot has a color, is at a certain tile, the tile below is clear, and the robot can move down. The effect is that the tile below is no longer clear and is now painted with the robot's color. This action increases the total cost by 2.\n\n4. up: This action allows a robot to move up to the tile above its current position. The preconditions are that the robot is at a certain tile, the tile above is clear, and the robot can move up. The effect is that the robot is now at the tile above, the tile it was previously at is now clear, and the tile it moved to is no longer clear. This action increases the total cost by 3.\n\n5. down: This action allows a robot to move down to the tile below its current position. The preconditions are that the robot is at a certain tile, the tile below is clear, and the robot can move down. The effect is that the robot is now at the tile below, the tile it was previously at is now clear, and the tile it moved to is no longer clear. This action increases the total cost by 1.\n\n6. right: This action allows a robot to move to the right to the tile adjacent to its current position. The preconditions are that the robot is at a certain tile, the tile to the right is clear, and the robot can move right. The effect is that the robot is now at the tile to the right, the tile it was previously at is now clear, and the tile it moved to is no longer clear. This action increases the total cost by 1.\n\n7. left: This action allows a robot to move to the left to the tile adjacent to its current position. The preconditions are that the robot is at a certain tile, the tile to the left is clear, and the robot can move left. The effect is that the robot is now at the tile to the left, the tile it was previously at is now clear, and the tile it moved to is no longer clear. This action increases the total cost by 1.\n\n</domain_nl>\n\n- The natural language description of the problem:\n<problem_nl>\nYou control a set of robots that can paint floor tiles with different colors. The robots can move in four directions: up, down, left, and right. They can paint with one color at a time and can change the color of their spray guns. Tiles can only be painted in the front (up) or behind (down) the robot, and once a tile is painted, no robot can stand on it.\n\nInitially:\n- There are twenty-five tiles arranged in a 5x5 grid (tile_0-1 to tile_5-5).\n- Robot1 is at tile_0-5 and has a white spray gun.\n- Robot2 is at tile_3-3 and has a black spray gun.\n- The colors white and black are available for painting.\n- All tiles except tile_3-3 are clear and unpainted.\n- The tiles have directional relationships with each other, allowing the robots to move up, down, left, and right between adjacent tiles.\n\nYour goal is to paint the following tiles with the specified colors in a checkerboard pattern:\n- The odd-numbered tiles in row 1 should be painted white, and the even-numbered tiles should be painted black.\n- The odd-numbered tiles in row 2 should be painted black, and the even-numbered tiles should be painted white.\n- The odd-numbered tiles in row 3 should be painted white, and the even-numbered tiles should be painted black.\n- The odd-numbered tiles in row 4 should be painted black, and the even-numbered tiles should be painted white.\n- The odd-numbered tiles in row 5 should be painted white, and the even-numbered tiles should be painted black.\n\nAdditionally, you aim to minimize the total cost of the actions taken to achieve this goal.\n</problem_nl>\n\n- The PDDL problem template:\n<problem_pddl>\n(define (problem p13-552)\n (:domain floor-tile)\n (:objects tile_0-1 tile_0-2 tile_0-3 tile_0-4 tile_0-5 \n           tile_1-1 tile_1-2 tile_1-3 tile_1-4 tile_1-5 \n           tile_2-1 tile_2-2 tile_2-3 tile_2-4 tile_2-5 \n           tile_3-1 tile_3-2 tile_3-3 tile_3-4 tile_3-5 \n           tile_4-1 tile_4-2 tile_4-3 tile_4-4 tile_4-5 \n           tile_5-1 tile_5-2 tile_5-3 tile_5-4 tile_5-5 -

The robots can move in four directions: up, down, left, and right. They can paint with one color at a time and can change the color of their spray guns. Tiles can only be painted in the front (up) or behind (down) the robot, and once a tile is painted, no robot can stand on it.\n\nInitially:\n- There are twenty-five tiles arranged in a 5x5 grid (tile_0-1 to tile_5-5).\n- Robot1 is at tile_2-2 and has a white spray gun.\n- Robot2 is at tile_5-4 and has a black spray gun.\n- The colors white and black are available for painting.\n- All tiles except tile_2-2 and tile_5-4 are clear and unpainted.\n- The tiles have directional relationships with each other, allowing the robots to move up, down, left, and right between adjacent tiles.\n\nYour goal is to paint the following tiles with the specified colors in a checkerboard pattern:\n- The odd-numbered tiles in row 1 should be painted white, and the even-numbered tiles should be painted black.\n- The even-numbered tiles in row 2 should be painted white, and the odd-numbered tiles should be painted black.\n- The odd-numbered tiles in row 3 should be painted white, and the even-numbered tiles should be painted black.\n- The even-numbered tiles in row 4 should be painted white, and the odd-numbered tiles should be painted black.\n- The odd-numbered tiles in row 5 should be painted white, and the even-numbered tiles should be painted black.\n\nAdditionally, you aim to minimize the total cost of the actions taken to achieve this goal.\n</problem_nl>\n\n- The PDDL problem template:\n<problem_pddl>\n(define (problem p14-552)\n (:domain floor-tile)\n (:objects tile_0-1 tile_0-2 tile_0-3 tile_0-4 tile_0-5 \n           tile_1-1 tile_1-2 tile_1-3 tile_1-4 tile_1-5 \n           tile_2-1 tile_2-2 tile_2-3 tile_2-4 tile_2-5 \n           tile_3-1 tile_3-2 tile_3-3 tile_3-4 tile_3-5 \n           tile_4-1 tile_4-2 tile_4-3 tile_4-4 tile_4-5 \n           tile_5-1 tile_5-2 tile_5-3 tile_5-4 tile_5-5 -

Tiles can only be painted in the front (up) or behind (down) the robot, and once a tile is painted, no robot can stand on it.\n\nInitially:\n- There are twenty-five tiles arranged in a 5x5 grid (tile_0-1 to tile_5-5).\n- Robot1 is at tile_2-2 and has a white spray gun.\n- Robot2 is at tile_5-4 and has a black spray gun.\n- The colors white and black are available for painting.\n- All tiles except tile_2-2 and tile_5-4 are clear and unpainted.\n- The tiles have directional relationships with each other, allowing the robots to move up, down, left, and right between adjacent tiles.\n\nYour goal is to paint the following tiles with the specified colors in a checkerboard pattern:\n- The odd-numbered tiles in row 1 should be painted white, and the even-numbered tiles should be painted black.\n- The even-numbered tiles in row 2 should be painted white, and the odd-numbered tiles should be painted black.\n- The odd-numbered tiles in row 3 should be painted white, and the even-numbered tiles should be painted black.\n- The even-numbered tiles in row 4 should be painted white, and the odd-numbered tiles should be painted black.\n- The odd-numbered tiles in row 5 should be painted white, and the even-numbered tiles should be painted black.\n\nAdditionally, you aim to minimize the total cost of the actions taken to achieve this goal.\n</problem_nl>\n\n- The PDDL problem template:\n<problem_pddl>\n(define (problem p14-552)\n (:domain floor-tile)\n (:objects tile_0-1 tile_0-2 tile_0-3 tile_0-4 tile_0-5 \n           tile_1-1 tile_1-2 tile_1-3 tile_1-4 tile_1-5 \n           tile_2-1 tile_2-2 tile_2-3 tile_2-4 tile_2-5 \n           tile_3-1 tile_3-2 tile_3-3 tile_3-4 tile_3-5 \n           tile_4-1 tile_4-2 tile_4-3 tile_4-4 tile_4-5 \n           tile_5-1 tile_5-2 tile_5-3 tile_5-4 tile_5-5 -

They make the painted tile no longer clear so robots cannot stand on painted tiles.\n- Movement actions update robot locations and clear/occupancy flags to prevent multiple robots occupying the same tile or entering painted tiles.\n- Change-color swaps the robot's current color and increases cost by 5.\n- Costs are implemented using (increase (total-cost) N), and the problem uses (:metric minimize (total-cost)).\n- No negative preconditions are used in action preconditions (so the domain requirements avoid :negative-preconditions). Negative effects are used (e.g., removing robot-at and clear predicates) which is standard.\n\nYou can run Fast Downward with these two files (domain and problem). If you want, I can also:\n- produce a slightly optimized domain (e.g., prevent no-op color changes),\n- produce a domain variant that allows painting left/right as well,\n- or provide a small example plan fragment or suggest heuristic settings for Fast Downward."

    "prompt_0shot": "You are an expert planner. I will provide you with:\n- A natural language description of the domain.\n- A natural language description of the problem. \n- A PDDL domain template.\n- A PDDL problem template.\n\nHere are:\n- The natural language description of the domain:\n<domain_nl>\nThe floor-tile domain is designed for planning the actions of robots to paint floor tiles with two colors. Each robot can move in four directions (up, down, right, left), change the color of paint it is carrying, and paint adjacent tiles. The domain also tracks the total cost of actions performed.\n\nThe actions defined in this domain include:\n\n1. change-color: This action allows a robot to change the color it has. The preconditions are that the robot currently has a color and the new color is available. The effect is that the robot no longer has the old color and now has the new color. This action increases the total cost by 5.\n\n2. paint-up: This action allows a robot to paint the tile above its current position.

problem init (grid adjacency) and in action preconditions.\n- Painting actions require the target tile to be clear (unoccupied), and painting makes it not clear and sets it painted with the chosen color \u2014 thus preventing robots from standing on painted tiles afterward, per your specification.\n- Movement actions require the destination to be clear; they update the clear predicate on source and destination tiles and update robot-at accordingly.\n- Costs are applied using numeric increase effects so FastDownward can minimize total-cost.\n- change-color includes a not-equal check to avoid no-op color changes.\n\nIf you want, I can:\n- Rename action names to move-up/move-down/move-right/move-left to avoid any possible confusion with adjacency predicate names.\n- Add inverse consistency axioms (e.g., if up A B then down B A) to avoid having to list both directions in the problem file.\n- Produce a compact or alternative encoding that reduces the number of adjacency facts by generating them with a small script (if you plan to scale to larger grids)."

I will provide you with:\n- A natural language description of the domain.\n- A natural language description of the problem. \n- A PDDL domain template.\n- A PDDL problem template.\n\nHere are:\n- The natural language description of the domain:\n<domain_nl>\nThe floor-tile domain is designed for planning the actions of robots to paint floor tiles with two colors. Each robot can move in four directions (up, down, right, left), change the color of paint it is carrying, and paint adjacent tiles. The domain also tracks the total cost of actions performed.\n\nThe actions defined in this domain include:\n\n1. change-color: This action allows a robot to change the color it has. The preconditions are that the robot currently has a color and the new color is available. The effect is that the robot no longer has the old color and now has the new color. This action increases the total cost by 5.\n\n2. paint-up: This action allows a robot to paint the tile above its current position. The preconditions are that the robot has a color, is at a certain tile, the tile above is clear, and the robot can move up. The effect is that the tile above is no longer clear and is now painted with the robot's color. This action increases the total cost by 2.\n\n3. paint-down: This action allows a robot to paint the tile below its current position. The preconditions are that the robot has a color, is at a certain tile, the tile below is clear, and the robot can move down. The effect is that the tile below is no longer clear and is now painted with the robot's color. This action increases the total cost by 2.\n\n4. up: This action allows a robot to move up to the tile above its current position. The preconditions are that the robot is at a certain tile, the tile above is clear, and the robot can move up. The effect is that the robot is now at the tile above, the tile it was previously at is now clear, and the tile it moved to is no longer clear. This action increases the total cost by 3.\n\n5. down: This action allows a robot to move down to the tile below its current position. The preconditions are that the robot is at a certain tile, the tile below is clear, and the robot can move down. The effect is that the robot is now at the tile below, the tile it was previously at is now clear, and the tile it moved to is no longer clear. This action increases the total cost by 1.\n\n6. right: This action allows a robot to move to the right to the tile adjacent to its current position. The preconditions are that the robot is at a certain tile, the tile to the right is clear, and the robot can move right. The effect is that the robot is now at the tile to the right, the tile it was previously at is now clear, and the tile it moved to is no longer clear. This action increases the total cost by 1.\n\n7. left: This action allows a robot to move to the left to the tile adjacent to its current position. The preconditions are that the robot is at a certain tile, the tile to the left is clear, and the robot can move left. The effect is that the robot is now at the tile to the left, the tile it was previously at is now clear, and the tile it moved to is no longer clear.

Each robot can move in four directions (up, down, right, left), change the color of paint it is carrying, and paint adjacent tiles. The domain also tracks the total cost of actions performed.\n\nThe actions defined in this domain include:\n\n1. change-color: This action allows a robot to change the color it has. The preconditions are that the robot currently has a color and the new color is available. The effect is that the robot no longer has the old color and now has the new color. This action increases the total cost by 5.\n\n2. paint-up: This action allows a robot to paint the tile above its current position. The preconditions are that the robot has a color, is at a certain tile, the tile above is clear, and the robot can move up. The effect is that the tile above is no longer clear and is now painted with the robot's color. This action increases the total cost by 2.\n\n3. paint-down: This action allows a robot to paint the tile below its current position. The preconditions are that the robot has a color, is at a certain tile, the tile below is clear, and the robot can move down. The effect is that the tile below is no longer clear and is now painted with the robot's color. This action increases the total cost by 2.\n\n4. up: This action allows a robot to move up to the tile above its current position. The preconditions are that the robot is at a certain tile, the tile above is clear, and the robot can move up. The effect is that the robot is now at the tile above, the tile it was previously at is now clear, and the tile it moved to is no longer clear. This action increases the total cost by 3.\n\n5. down: This action allows a robot to move down to the tile below its current position. The preconditions are that the robot is at a certain tile, the tile below is clear, and the robot can move down. The effect is that the robot is now at the tile below, the tile it was previously at is now clear, and the tile it moved to is no longer clear. This action increases the total cost by 1.\n\n6. right: This action allows a robot to move to the right to the tile adjacent to its current position. The preconditions are that the robot is at a certain tile, the tile to the right is clear, and the robot can move right. The effect is that the robot is now at the tile to the right, the tile it was previously at is now clear, and the tile it moved to is no longer clear. This action increases the total cost by 1.\n\n7. left: This action allows a robot to move to the left to the tile adjacent to its current position. The preconditions are that the robot is at a certain tile, the tile to the left is clear, and the robot can move left. The effect is that the robot is now at the tile to the left, the tile it was previously at is now clear, and the tile it moved to is no longer clear.

This prevents standing on painted tiles because painting removes clear.\n- Painting actions require the target tile be clear and become painted (and not clear) after painting; they add a painted fact including the color and increase total-cost.\n- change-color requires the robot currently have some color and changes to an available color different from its current color; it updates robot-has and increases total-cost.\n- Action costs are implemented using increase on the total-cost function and match the specified costs.\n- The problem file already contained the adjacency (up/down/right/left) relation facts and initial clears; robot-occupied tiles were intentionally not listed as clear.\n\nYou can feed these two files to FastDownward (domain and problem) to attempt to find a cost-minimizing plan. If you want, I can also produce a small example plan or run a sanity check on reachability for a few tiles."

    "prompt_0shot": "You are an expert planner. I will provide you with:\n- A natural language description of the domain.\n- A natural language description of the problem. \n- A PDDL domain template.\n- A PDDL problem template.\n\nHere are:\n- The natural language description of the domain:\n<domain_nl>\nThe floor-tile domain is designed for planning the actions of robots to paint floor tiles with two colors. Each robot can move in four directions (up, down, right, left), change the color of paint it is carrying, and paint adjacent tiles. The domain also tracks the total cost of actions performed.\n\nThe actions defined in this domain include:\n\n1. change-color: This action allows a robot to change the color it has. The preconditions are that the robot currently has a color and the new color is available. The effect is that the robot no longer has the old color and now has the new color. This action increases the total cost by 5.\n\n2. paint-up: This action allows a robot to paint the tile above its current position. The preconditions are that the robot has a color, is at a certain tile, the tile above is clear, and the robot can move up. The effect is that the tile above is no longer clear and is now painted with the robot's color. This action increases the total cost by 2.\n\n3. paint-down: This action allows a robot to paint the tile below its current position. The preconditions are that the robot has a color, is at a certain tile, the tile below is clear, and the robot can move down. The effect is that the tile below is no longer clear and is now painted with the robot's color. This action increases the total cost by 2.\n\n4. up: This action allows a robot to move up to the tile above its current position. The preconditions are that the robot is at a certain tile, the tile above is clear, and the robot can move up. The effect is that the robot is now at the tile above, the tile it was previously at is now clear, and the tile it moved to is no longer clear. This action increases the total cost by 3.\n\n5. down: This action allows a robot to move down to the tile below its current position. The preconditions are that the robot is at a certain tile, the tile below is clear, and the robot can move down. The effect is that the robot is now at the tile below, the tile it was previously at is now clear, and the tile it moved to is no longer clear. This action increases the total cost by 1.\n\n6. right: This action allows a robot to move to the right to the tile adjacent to its current position. The preconditions are that the robot is at a certain tile, the tile to the right is clear, and the robot can move right. The effect is that the robot is now at the tile to the right, the tile it was previously at is now clear, and the tile it moved to is no longer clear. This action increases the total cost by 1.\n\n7. left: This action allows a robot to move to the left to the tile adjacent to its current position. The preconditions are that the robot is at a certain tile, the tile to the left is clear, and the robot can move left. The effect is that the robot is now at the tile to the left, the tile it was previously at is now clear, and the tile it moved to is no longer clear. This action increases the total cost by 1.\n\n</domain_nl>\n\n- The natural language description of the problem:\n<problem_nl>\nYou control a set of robots that can paint floor tiles with different colors. The robots can move in four directions: up, down, left, and right. They can paint with one color at a time and can change the color of their spray guns.

    "prompt": "You are an expert planner. I will provide you with:\n- A natural language description of the domain.\n- A natural language description of the problem. \n- A PDDL domain template.\n- A PDDL problem template.\n\nHere are:\n- The natural language description of the domain:\n<domain_nl>\nThe floor-tile domain is designed for planning the actions of robots to paint floor tiles with two colors. Each robot can move in four directions (up, down, right, left), change the color of paint it is carrying, and paint adjacent tiles. The domain also tracks the total cost of actions performed.\n\nThe actions defined in this domain include:\n\n1. change-color: This action allows a robot to change the color it has. The preconditions are that the robot currently has a color and the new color is available. The effect is that the robot no longer has the old color and now has the new color. This action increases the total cost by 5.\n\n2. paint-up: This action allows a robot to paint the tile above its current position. The preconditions are that the robot has a color, is at a certain tile, the tile above is clear, and the robot can move up. The effect is that the tile above is no longer clear and is now painted with the robot's color. This action increases the total cost by 2.\n\n3. paint-down: This action allows a robot to paint the tile below its current position. The preconditions are that the robot has a color, is at a certain tile, the tile below is clear, and the robot can move down. The effect is that the tile below is no longer clear and is now painted with the robot's color. This action increases the total cost by 2.\n\n4. up: This action allows a robot to move up to the tile above its current position. The preconditions are that the robot is at a certain tile, the tile above is clear, and the robot can move up. The effect is that the robot is now at the tile above, the tile it was previously at is now clear, and the tile it moved to is no longer clear. This action increases the total cost by 3.\n\n5. down: This action allows a robot to move down to the tile below its current position. The preconditions are that the robot is at a certain tile, the tile below is clear, and the robot can move down. The effect is that the robot is now at the tile below, the tile it was previously at is now clear, and the tile it moved to is no longer clear. This action increases the total cost by 1.\n\n6. right: This action allows a robot to move to the right to the tile adjacent to its current position. The preconditions are that the robot is at a certain tile, the tile to the right is clear, and the robot can move right. The effect is that the robot is now at the tile to the right, the tile it was previously at is now clear, and the tile it moved to is no longer clear. This action increases the total cost by 1.\n\n7. left: This action allows a robot to move to the left to the tile adjacent to its current position. The preconditions are that the robot is at a certain tile, the tile to the left is clear, and the robot can move left. The effect is that the robot is now at the tile to the left, the tile it was previously at is now clear, and the tile it moved to is no longer clear. This action increases the total cost by 1.\n\n</domain_nl>\n\n- The natural language description of the problem:\n<problem_nl>\nYou control a set of robots that can paint floor tiles with different colors.

Once painted, a tile ceases to be clear, so robots cannot move onto painted tiles.\n- Costs reflect the original description: change-color = 5, paint actions = 2, movement costs: up = 3, down = 1, right = 1, left = 1.\n- No negative preconditions were used to maximize compatibility; changing to the same color is allowed (but costly), so planners will avoid unnecessary color changes when minimizing cost.\n\nYou can run FastDownward with these two files (domain and problem) to search for a minimum-cost plan."

    "prompt_0shot": "You are an expert planner. I will provide you with:\n- A natural language description of the domain.\n- A natural language description of the problem. \n- A PDDL domain template.\n- A PDDL problem template.\n\nHere are:\n- The natural language description of the domain:\n<domain_nl>\nThe floor-tile domain is designed for planning the actions of robots to paint floor tiles with two colors. Each robot can move in four directions (up, down, right, left), change the color of paint it is carrying, and paint adjacent tiles. The domain also tracks the total cost of actions performed.\n\nThe actions defined in this domain include:\n\n1. change-color: This action allows a robot to change the color it has. The preconditions are that the robot currently has a color and the new color is available. The effect is that the robot no longer has the old color and now has the new color. This action increases the total cost by 5.\n\n2. paint-up: This action allows a robot to paint the tile above its current position. The preconditions are that the robot has a color, is at a certain tile, the tile above is clear, and the robot can move up. The effect is that the tile above is no longer clear and is now painted with the robot's color. This action increases the total cost by 2.\n\n3. paint-down: This action allows a robot to paint the tile below its current position. The preconditions are that the robot has a color, is at a certain tile, the tile below is clear, and the robot can move down. The effect is that the tile below is no longer clear and is now painted with the robot's color. This action increases the total cost by 2.\n\n4. up: This action allows a robot to move up to the tile above its current position. The preconditions are that the robot is at a certain tile, the tile above is clear, and the robot can move up. The effect is that the robot is now at the tile above, the tile it was previously at is now clear, and the tile it moved to is no longer clear. This action increases the total cost by 3.\n\n5. down: This action allows a robot to move down to the tile below its current position. The preconditions are that the robot is at a certain tile, the tile below is clear, and the robot can move down. The effect is that the robot is now at the tile below, the tile it was previously at is now clear, and the tile it moved to is no longer clear. This action increases the total cost by 1.\n\n6. right: This action allows a robot to move to the right to the tile adjacent to its current position. The preconditions are that the robot is at a certain tile, the tile to the right is clear, and the robot can move right. The effect is that the robot is now at the tile to the right, the tile it was previously at is now clear, and the tile it moved to is no longer clear. This action increases the total cost by 1.\n\n7. left: This action allows a robot to move to the left to the tile adjacent to its current position. The preconditions are that the robot is at a certain tile, the tile to the left is clear, and the robot can move left. The effect is that the robot is now at the tile to the left, the tile it was previously at is now clear, and the tile it moved to is no longer clear. This action increases the total cost by 1.\n\n</domain_nl>\n\n- The natural language description of the problem:\n<problem_nl>\nYou control two robots that can paint floor tiles with different colors. The robots can move in four directions: up, down, left, and right. They can paint with one color at a time and can change the color of their spray guns. Tiles can only be painted in the front (up) or behind (down) the robot, and once a tile is painted, no robot can stand on it.\n\nInitially:\n- There are 36 tiles arranged in a 6x6 grid (tile_0-1 to tile_5-5).\n- Robot1 is at tile_5-3 and has a white spray gun.\n- Robot2 is at tile_1-5 and has a black spray gun.\n- The colors white and black are available for painting.\n- All tiles except tile_5-3 and tile_1-5 are clear and unpainted.\n- The tiles have directional relationships with each other, allowing the robots to move up, down, left, and right between adjacent tiles.\n\nYour goal is to paint the following tiles with the specified colors in a checkerboard pattern:\n- The odd-numbered tiles in row 1 should be painted white, and the even-numbered tiles should be painted black.\n- The even-numbered tiles in row 2 should be painted white, and the odd-numbered tiles should be painted black.\n- The odd-numbered tiles in row 3 should be painted white, and the even-numbered tiles should be painted black.\n- The even-numbered tiles in row 4 should be painted white, and the odd-numbered tiles should be painted black.\n- The odd-numbered tiles in row 5 should be painted white, and the even-numbered tiles should be painted black.\n\nAdditionally, you aim to minimize the total cost of the actions taken to achieve this goal.\n</problem_nl>\n\n- The PDDL problem template:\n<problem_pddl>\n(define (problem p18-552)\n (:domain floor-tile)\n (:objects tile_0-1 tile_0-2 tile_0-3 tile_0-4 tile_0-5 \n           tile_1-1 tile_1-2 tile_1-3 tile_1-4 tile_1-5 \n           tile_2-1 tile_2-2 tile_2-3 tile_2-4 tile_2-5 \n           tile_3-1 tile_3-2 tile_3-3 tile_3-4 tile_3-5 \n           tile_4-1 tile_4-2 tile_4-3 tile_4-4 tile_4-5 \n           tile_5-1 tile_5-2 tile_5-3 tile_5-4 tile_5-5 -

    "prompt": "You are an expert planner. I will provide you with:\n- A natural language description of the domain.\n- A natural language description of the problem. \n- A PDDL domain template.\n- A PDDL problem template.\n\nHere are:\n- The natural language description of the domain:\n<domain_nl>\nThe floor-tile domain is designed for planning the actions of robots to paint floor tiles with two colors. Each robot can move in four directions (up, down, right, left), change the color of paint it is carrying, and paint adjacent tiles. The domain also tracks the total cost of actions performed.\n\nThe actions defined in this domain include:\n\n1. change-color: This action allows a robot to change the color it has. The preconditions are that the robot currently has a color and the new color is available. The effect is that the robot no longer has the old color and now has the new color. This action increases the total cost by 5.\n\n2. paint-up: This action allows a robot to paint the tile above its current position. The preconditions are that the robot has a color, is at a certain tile, the tile above is clear, and the robot can move up. The effect is that the tile above is no longer clear and is now painted with the robot's color. This action increases the total cost by 2.\n\n3. paint-down: This action allows a robot to paint the tile below its current position. The preconditions are that the robot has a color, is at a certain tile, the tile below is clear, and the robot can move down. The effect is that the tile below is no longer clear and is now painted with the robot's color. This action increases the total cost by 2.\n\n4. up: This action allows a robot to move up to the tile above its current position. The preconditions are that the robot is at a certain tile, the tile above is clear, and the robot can move up. The effect is that the robot is now at the tile above, the tile it was previously at is now clear, and the tile it moved to is no longer clear. This action increases the total cost by 3.\n\n5. down: This action allows a robot to move down to the tile below its current position. The preconditions are that the robot is at a certain tile, the tile below is clear, and the robot can move down. The effect is that the robot is now at the tile below, the tile it was previously at is now clear, and the tile it moved to is no longer clear. This action increases the total cost by 1.\n\n6. right: This action allows a robot to move to the right to the tile adjacent to its current position. The preconditions are that the robot is at a certain tile, the tile to the right is clear, and the robot can move right. The effect is that the robot is now at the tile to the right, the tile it was previously at is now clear, and the tile it moved to is no longer clear. This action increases the total cost by 1.\n\n7. left: This action allows a robot to move to the left to the tile adjacent to its current position. The preconditions are that the robot is at a certain tile, the tile to the left is clear, and the robot can move left. The effect is that the robot is now at the tile to the left, the tile it was previously at is now clear, and the tile it moved to is no longer clear. This action increases the total cost by 1.\n\n</domain_nl>\n\n- The natural language description of the problem:\n<problem_nl>\nYou control two robots that can paint floor tiles with different colors. The robots can move in four directions: up, down, left, and right. They can paint with one color at a time and can change the color of their spray guns. Tiles can only be painted in the front (up) or behind (down) the robot, and once a tile is painted, no robot can stand on it.\n\nInitially:\n- There are 36 tiles arranged in a 6x6 grid (tile_0-1 to tile_5-5).\n- Robot1 is at tile_5-3 and has a white spray gun.\n- Robot2 is at tile_1-5 and has a black spray gun.\n- The colors white and black are available for painting.\n- All tiles except tile_5-3 and tile_1-5 are clear and unpainted.\n- The tiles have directional relationships with each other, allowing the robots to move up, down, left, and right between adjacent tiles.\n\nYour goal is to paint the following tiles with the specified colors in a checkerboard pattern:\n- The odd-numbered tiles in row 1 should be painted white, and the even-numbered tiles should be painted black.\n- The even-numbered tiles in row 2 should be painted white, and the odd-numbered tiles should be painted black.\n- The odd-numbered tiles in row 3 should be painted white, and the even-numbered tiles should be painted black.\n- The even-numbered tiles in row 4 should be painted white, and the odd-numbered tiles should be painted black.\n- The odd-numbered tiles in row 5 should be painted white, and the even-numbered tiles should be painted black.\n\nAdditionally, you aim to minimize the total cost of the actions taken to achieve this goal.\n</problem_nl>\n\n- The PDDL problem template:\n<problem_pddl>\n(define (problem p18-552)\n (:domain floor-tile)\n (:objects tile_0-1 tile_0-2 tile_0-3 tile_0-4 tile_0-5 \n           tile_1-1 tile_1-2 tile_1-3 tile_1-4 tile_1-5 \n           tile_2-1 tile_2-2 tile_2-3 tile_2-4 tile_2-5 \n           tile_3-1 tile_3-2 tile_3-3 tile_3-4 tile_3-5 \n           tile_4-1 tile_4-2 tile_4-3 tile_4-4 tile_4-5 \n           tile_5-1 tile_5-2 tile_5-3 tile_5-4 tile_5-5 -
