1) Action: schedule-meeting at timeslot 12:30–13:00 (plan entry: schedule-meeting ts-12_30_13_00 billy brian patricia)
   - What happens: A 30-minute meeting is scheduled from 12:30 to 13:00 on Monday.
   - Participants: Billy, Brian, Patricia (as listed in the plan).
   - Effects (as encoded by the domain): the meeting is marked as scheduled (goal satisfied); the timeslot 12:30–13:00 is no longer a candidate; and none of the three participants remains free at that timeslot.
   - Notes: This slot is within work hours (09:00–17:00), matches the audited valid candidate set, and respects Billy’s preference to avoid meetings after 15:30.
