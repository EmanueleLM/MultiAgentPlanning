Plan (human-readable actions)

1) Action: choose-start-slot m1 s4 s5
   - Schedule meeting "m1" to start at slot s4 (Monday 10:30–11:00) and occupy the next slot s5 (Monday 11:00–11:30).
   - Duration: 60 minutes (two consecutive 30‑minute slots).
   - Participants: Theresa, Charles, Betty.
   - Rationale / effect: meeting m1 is now scheduled for 10:30–11:30; the two slots s4 and s5 are consumed for all participants. These slots are within the 09:00–17:00 work window and are free for Theresa, Charles, and Betty, so the hard constraints are satisfied.
