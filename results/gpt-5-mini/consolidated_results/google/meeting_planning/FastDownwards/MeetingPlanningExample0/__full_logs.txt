NATURAL-PLAN sas_plan_2
------------------------------
Planned actions (exact sequence from the PDDL plan):

1) Wait at Marina District
   - From 09:00 to 10:10 (t540 -> t610)
   - Duration: 70 minutes

2) Travel from Marina District to Mission District
   - Depart 10:10 (t610), arrive 10:30 (t630)
   - Duration: 20 minutes (matches Marina -> Mission travel time)

3) Meet Stephanie in Mission District
   - From 10:30 to 12:30 (t630 -> t750)
   - Duration: 120 minutes (meets the required minimum and lies within Stephanie’s 10:30–13:30 availability)
