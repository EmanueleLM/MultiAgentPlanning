Action: at-richmond. Cumulative minutes-from-midnight: 540.\n- Wait in Richmond until departure at 16:53.\n  - 16:53 (1013): Depart Richmond District. Action: travel-richmond-to-financial. Travel duration: 22 minutes (graph: richmond->financial = 22).\n- 17:15 (1035): Arrive at Financial District. Action: at-financial.

This satisfies the requirement of at least 60 minutes and maximizes meeting minutes within Betty's availability window (17:15\u201321:45).\n- End time: 21:45 (1305). Optionally, travel back afterwards (not required to satisfy goal).\n\nSummary of key times (minutes-from-midnight):\n- Start: 09:00 = 540\n- Depart Richmond: 16:53 = 1013\n- Arrive Financial: 17:15 = 1035\n- Meeting start: 1035\n- Meeting end: 1305\n- Meeting total: 270 minutes\n\nRationale: Leaving Richmond at 16:53 arrives exactly at Betty's earliest availability (17:15). Staying continuously until 21:45 yields the maximum feasible meeting time (270 minutes), which both satisfies the minimum 60-minute requirement and maximizes met-betty under the given constraints and travel times."

    "proposed_solution": "I will remain in Richmond District until late afternoon, then travel to Financial District to meet Betty as soon as she becomes available and stay until her availability ends.\n\nSchedule (chronological steps):\n- 09:00 (540): Arrive and start at Richmond District. Action: at-richmond. Cumulative minutes-from-midnight: 540.\n- Wait in Richmond until departure at 16:53.\n  - 16:53 (1013): Depart Richmond District. Action: travel-richmond-to-financial. Travel duration: 22 minutes (graph: richmond->financial = 22).\n- 17:15 (1035): Arrive at Financial District. Action: at-financial.

This satisfies the requirement of at least 60 minutes and maximizes meeting minutes within Betty's availability window (17:15\u201321:45).\n- End time: 21:45 (1305). Optionally, travel back afterwards (not required to satisfy goal).\n\nSummary of key times (minutes-from-midnight):\n- Start: 09:00 = 540\n- Depart Richmond: 16:53 = 1013\n- Arrive Financial: 17:15 = 1035\n- Meeting start: 1035\n- Meeting end: 1305\n- Meeting total: 270 minutes\n\nRationale: Leaving Richmond at 16:53 arrives exactly at Betty's earliest availability (17:15). Staying continuously until 21:45 yields the maximum feasible meeting time (270 minutes), which both satisfies the minimum 60-minute requirement and maximizes met-betty under the given constraints and travel times."

Encode locations as predicates (at-richmond) and (at-financial) that are mutually exclusive. Provide actions for traveling between districts with numeric time increases matching the graph, a small wait action (e.g., wait-5) to advance time, and meeting actions (meet-betty-60 and meet-betty-15) that increase both time and met-betty subject to the availability window. Include initial time 540 (09:00), availability window start 1035 (17:15), end 1305 (21:45), and a goal that requires met-betty >= 60 and time <= 1305. Add a metric to maximize met-betty.",

    "proposed_solution": "I will remain in Richmond District until late afternoon, then travel to Financial District to meet Betty as soon as she becomes available and stay until her availability ends.\n\nSchedule (chronological steps):\n- 09:00 (540): Arrive and start at Richmond District. Action: at-richmond. Cumulative minutes-from-midnight: 540.\n- Wait in Richmond until departure at 16:53.\n  - 16:53 (1013): Depart Richmond District. Action: travel-richmond-to-financial. Travel duration: 22 minutes (graph: richmond->financial = 22).\n- 17:15 (1035): Arrive at Financial District. Action: at-financial. (1013 + 22 = 1035)\n- 17:15\u201321:45 (1035\u20131305): Meet Betty at Financial District. Total meeting duration = 270 minutes (4 hours 30 minutes). This satisfies the requirement of at least 60 minutes and maximizes meeting minutes within Betty's availability window (17:15\u201321:45).\n- End time: 21:45 (1305). Optionally, travel back afterwards (not required to satisfy goal).\n\nSummary of key times (minutes-from-midnight):\n- Start: 09:00 = 540\n- Depart Richmond: 16:53 = 1013\n- Arrive Financial: 17:15 = 1035\n- Meeting start: 1035\n- Meeting end: 1305\n- Meeting total: 270 minutes\n\nRationale: Leaving Richmond at 16:53 arrives exactly at Betty's earliest availability (17:15). Staying continuously until 21:45 yields the maximum feasible meeting time (270 minutes), which both satisfies the minimum 60-minute requirement and maximizes met-betty under the given constraints and travel times."

    "proposed_solution": "I will remain in Richmond District until late afternoon, then travel to Financial District to meet Betty as soon as she becomes available and stay until her availability ends.\n\nSchedule (chronological steps):\n- 09:00 (540): Arrive and start at Richmond District. Action: at-richmond. Cumulative minutes-from-midnight: 540.\n- Wait in Richmond until departure at 16:53.\n  - 16:53 (1013): Depart Richmond District. Action: travel-richmond-to-financial. Travel duration: 22 minutes (graph: richmond->financial = 22).\n- 17:15 (1035): Arrive at Financial District. Action: at-financial. (1013 + 22 = 1035)\n- 17:15\u201321:45 (1035\u20131305): Meet Betty at Financial District. Total meeting duration = 270 minutes (4 hours 30 minutes). This satisfies the requirement of at least 60 minutes and maximizes meeting minutes within Betty's availability window (17:15\u201321:45).\n- End time: 21:45 (1305). Optionally, travel back afterwards (not required to satisfy goal).\n\nSummary of key times (minutes-from-midnight):\n- Start: 09:00 = 540\n- Depart Richmond: 16:53 = 1013\n- Arrive Financial: 17:15 = 1035\n- Meeting start: 1035\n- Meeting end: 1305\n- Meeting total: 270 minutes\n\nRationale: Leaving Richmond at 16:53 arrives exactly at Betty's earliest availability (17:15). Staying continuously until 21:45 yields the maximum feasible meeting time (270 minutes), which both satisfies the minimum 60-minute requirement and maximizes met-betty under the given constraints and travel times."

    "proposed_solution": "I will remain in Richmond District until late afternoon, then travel to Financial District to meet Betty as soon as she becomes available and stay until her availability ends.\n\nSchedule (chronological steps):\n- 09:00 (540): Arrive and start at Richmond District. Action: at-richmond. Cumulative minutes-from-midnight: 540.\n- Wait in Richmond until departure at 16:53.\n  - 16:53 (1013): Depart Richmond District. Action: travel-richmond-to-financial. Travel duration: 22 minutes (graph: richmond->financial = 22).\n- 17:15 (1035): Arrive at Financial District. Action: at-financial. (1013 + 22 = 1035)\n- 17:15\u201321:45 (1035\u20131305): Meet Betty at Financial District. Total meeting duration = 270 minutes (4 hours 30 minutes). This satisfies the requirement of at least 60 minutes and maximizes meeting minutes within Betty's availability window (17:15\u201321:45).\n- End time: 21:45 (1305). Optionally, travel back afterwards (not required to satisfy goal).\n\nSummary of key times (minutes-from-midnight):\n- Start: 09:00 = 540\n- Depart Richmond: 16:53 = 1013\n- Arrive Financial: 17:15 = 1035\n- Meeting start: 1035\n- Meeting end: 1305\n- Meeting total: 270 minutes\n\nRationale: Leaving Richmond at 16:53 arrives exactly at Betty's earliest availability (17:15). Staying continuously until 21:45 yields the maximum feasible meeting time (270 minutes), which both satisfies the minimum 60-minute requirement and maximizes met-betty under the given constraints and travel times."

    "proposed_solution": "I will remain in Richmond District until late afternoon, then travel to Financial District to meet Betty as soon as she becomes available and stay until her availability ends.\n\nSchedule (chronological steps):\n- 09:00 (540): Arrive and start at Richmond District. Action: at-richmond. Cumulative minutes-from-midnight: 540.\n- Wait in Richmond until departure at 16:53.\n  - 16:53 (1013): Depart Richmond District. Action: travel-richmond-to-financial. Travel duration: 22 minutes (graph: richmond->financial = 22).\n- 17:15 (1035): Arrive at Financial District. Action: at-financial. (1013 + 22 = 1035)\n- 17:15\u201321:45 (1035\u20131305): Meet Betty at Financial District. Total meeting duration = 270 minutes (4 hours 30 minutes). This satisfies the requirement of at least 60 minutes and maximizes meeting minutes within Betty's availability window (17:15\u201321:45).\n- End time: 21:45 (1305). Optionally, travel back afterwards (not required to satisfy goal).\n\nSummary of key times (minutes-from-midnight):\n- Start: 09:00 = 540\n- Depart Richmond: 16:53 = 1013\n- Arrive Financial: 17:15 = 1035\n- Meeting start: 1035\n- Meeting end: 1305\n- Meeting total: 270 minutes\n\nRationale: Leaving Richmond at 16:53 arrives exactly at Betty's earliest availability (17:15). Staying continuously until 21:45 yields the maximum feasible meeting time (270 minutes), which both satisfies the minimum 60-minute requirement and maximizes met-betty under the given constraints and travel times."

    "proposed_solution": "I will remain in Richmond District until late afternoon, then travel to Financial District to meet Betty as soon as she becomes available and stay until her availability ends.\n\nSchedule (chronological steps):\n- 09:00 (540): Arrive and start at Richmond District. Action: at-richmond. Cumulative minutes-from-midnight: 540.\n- Wait in Richmond until departure at 16:53.\n  - 16:53 (1013): Depart Richmond District. Action: travel-richmond-to-financial. Travel duration: 22 minutes (graph: richmond->financial = 22).\n- 17:15 (1035): Arrive at Financial District. Action: at-financial. (1013 + 22 = 1035)\n- 17:15\u201321:45 (1035\u20131305): Meet Betty at Financial District. Total meeting duration = 270 minutes (4 hours 30 minutes). This satisfies the requirement of at least 60 minutes and maximizes meeting minutes within Betty's availability window (17:15\u201321:45).\n- End time: 21:45 (1305). Optionally, travel back afterwards (not required to satisfy goal).\n\nSummary of key times (minutes-from-midnight):\n- Start: 09:00 = 540\n- Depart Richmond: 16:53 = 1013\n- Arrive Financial: 17:15 = 1035\n- Meeting start: 1035\n- Meeting end: 1305\n- Meeting total: 270 minutes\n\nRationale: Leaving Richmond at 16:53 arrives exactly at Betty's earliest availability (17:15). Staying continuously until 21:45 yields the maximum feasible meeting time (270 minutes), which both satisfies the minimum 60-minute requirement and maximizes met-betty under the given constraints and travel times."

    "proposed_solution": "I will remain in Richmond District until late afternoon, then travel to Financial District to meet Betty as soon as she becomes available and stay until her availability ends.\n\nSchedule (chronological steps):\n- 09:00 (540): Arrive and start at Richmond District. Action: at-richmond. Cumulative minutes-from-midnight: 540.\n- Wait in Richmond until departure at 16:53.\n  - 16:53 (1013): Depart Richmond District. Action: travel-richmond-to-financial. Travel duration: 22 minutes (graph: richmond->financial = 22).\n- 17:15 (1035): Arrive at Financial District. Action: at-financial. (1013 + 22 = 1035)\n- 17:15\u201321:45 (1035\u20131305): Meet Betty at Financial District. Total meeting duration = 270 minutes (4 hours 30 minutes). This satisfies the requirement of at least 60 minutes and maximizes meeting minutes within Betty's availability window (17:15\u201321:45).\n- End time: 21:45 (1305). Optionally, travel back afterwards (not required to satisfy goal).\n\nSummary of key times (minutes-from-midnight):\n- Start: 09:00 = 540\n- Depart Richmond: 16:53 = 1013\n- Arrive Financial: 17:15 = 1035\n- Meeting start: 1035\n- Meeting end: 1305\n- Meeting total: 270 minutes\n\nRationale: Leaving Richmond at 16:53 arrives exactly at Betty's earliest availability (17:15). Staying continuously until 21:45 yields the maximum feasible meeting time (270 minutes), which both satisfies the minimum 60-minute requirement and maximizes met-betty under the given constraints and travel times."

    "proposed_solution": "I will remain in Richmond District until late afternoon, then travel to Financial District to meet Betty as soon as she becomes available and stay until her availability ends.\n\nSchedule (chronological steps):\n- 09:00 (540): Arrive and start at Richmond District. Action: at-richmond. Cumulative minutes-from-midnight: 540.\n- Wait in Richmond until departure at 16:53.\n  - 16:53 (1013): Depart Richmond District. Action: travel-richmond-to-financial. Travel duration: 22 minutes (graph: richmond->financial = 22).\n- 17:15 (1035): Arrive at Financial District. Action: at-financial. (1013 + 22 = 1035)\n- 17:15\u201321:45 (1035\u20131305): Meet Betty at Financial District. Total meeting duration = 270 minutes (4 hours 30 minutes). This satisfies the requirement of at least 60 minutes and maximizes meeting minutes within Betty's availability window (17:15\u201321:45).\n- End time: 21:45 (1305). Optionally, travel back afterwards (not required to satisfy goal).\n\nSummary of key times (minutes-from-midnight):\n- Start: 09:00 = 540\n- Depart Richmond: 16:53 = 1013\n- Arrive Financial: 17:15 = 1035\n- Meeting start: 1035\n- Meeting end: 1305\n- Meeting total: 270 minutes\n\nRationale: Leaving Richmond at 16:53 arrives exactly at Betty's earliest availability (17:15). Staying continuously until 21:45 yields the maximum feasible meeting time (270 minutes), which both satisfies the minimum 60-minute requirement and maximizes met-betty under the given constraints and travel times."

    "proposed_solution": "I will remain in Richmond District until late afternoon, then travel to Financial District to meet Betty as soon as she becomes available and stay until her availability ends.\n\nSchedule (chronological steps):\n- 09:00 (540): Arrive and start at Richmond District. Action: at-richmond. Cumulative minutes-from-midnight: 540.\n- Wait in Richmond until departure at 16:53.\n  - 16:53 (1013): Depart Richmond District. Action: travel-richmond-to-financial. Travel duration: 22 minutes (graph: richmond->financial = 22).\n- 17:15 (1035): Arrive at Financial District. Action: at-financial. (1013 + 22 = 1035)\n- 17:15\u201321:45 (1035\u20131305): Meet Betty at Financial District. Total meeting duration = 270 minutes (4 hours 30 minutes). This satisfies the requirement of at least 60 minutes and maximizes meeting minutes within Betty's availability window (17:15\u201321:45).\n- End time: 21:45 (1305). Optionally, travel back afterwards (not required to satisfy goal).\n\nSummary of key times (minutes-from-midnight):\n- Start: 09:00 = 540\n- Depart Richmond: 16:53 = 1013\n- Arrive Financial: 17:15 = 1035\n- Meeting start: 1035\n- Meeting end: 1305\n- Meeting total: 270 minutes\n\nRationale: Leaving Richmond at 16:53 arrives exactly at Betty's earliest availability (17:15). Staying continuously until 21:45 yields the maximum feasible meeting time (270 minutes), which both satisfies the minimum 60-minute requirement and maximizes met-betty under the given constraints and travel times."

Outcome:
- The traveler departs Bayview at 09:00, arrives Golden Gate Park at 09:22, and conducts one contiguous meeting with Barbara from 09:22 through 10:52 (90 consecutive minutes).
- This satisfies the requirement to meet Barbara for at least 90 minutes within her availability window (08:00–11:30).

NATURAL-PLAN sas_plan_10
------------------------------
Tick-to-time mapping used below:
- t0 = 09:00, t1 = 09:15, t2 = 09:30, t3 = 09:45, t4 = 10:00, t5 = 10:15, t6 = 10:30, t7 = 10:45, t8 = 11:00, t9 = 11:15, t10 = 11:30, t11 = 11:45, t12 = 12:00, t13 = 12:15, t14 = 12:30, t15 = 12:45, t16 = 13:00, t17 = 13:15, t18 = 13:30.

Plan steps (exact correspondence to the PDDL plan):

1) (begin-travel traveler nobhill thecastro t0)
   - Action: Begin travel from Nob Hill to The Castro.
   - Timestamp: started at t0 = 09:00.
   - Note: marks departure; does not advance the current time by itself.

2) (travel-step-1 traveler nobhill thecastro t0 t1)
   - Action: Travel step 1 (first 15-minute travel tick).
   - Time consumed: t0 → t1 (09:00–09:15).

3) (travel-step-2 traveler nobhill thecastro t1 t2)
   - Action: Travel step 2 (second 15-minute travel tick).
   - Time consumed: t1 → t2 (09:15–09:30).
   - Result: travel_done; arrival tick will be t2.

4) (arrive traveler nobhill thecastro t2)
   - Action: Finalize arrival at The Castro.
   - Timestamp: arrival confirmed at t2 = 09:30.
   - Travel summary: conservative rounded travel duration = 2 ticks = 30 minutes (09:00–09:30).

5) (advance-time t2 t3)
   - Action: Wait / advance time at The Castro.
   - Time consumed: t2 → t3 (09:30–09:45).

6) (advance-time t3 t4)
   - Action: Wait.
   - Time consumed: t3 → t4 (09:45–10:00).

7) (advance-time t4 t5)
   - Action: Wait.
   - Time consumed: t4 → t5 (10:00–10:15).

8) (advance-time t5 t6)
   - Action: Wait.
   - Time consumed: t5 → t6 (10:15–10:30).

9) (advance-time t6 t7)
   - Action: Wait.
   - Time consumed: t6 → t7 (10:30–10:45).

10) (advance-time t7 t8)
    - Action: Wait.
    - Time consumed: t7 → t8 (10:45–11:00).

11) (advance-time t8 t9)
    - Action: Wait.
    - Time consumed: t8 → t9 (11:00–11:15).

12) (advance-time t9 t10)
    - Action: Wait.
    - Time consumed: t9 → t10 (11:15–11:30).

13) (advance-time t10 t11)
    - Action: Wait.
    - Time consumed: t10 → t11 (11:30–11:45).

14) (advance-time t11 t12)
    - Action: Wait.
    - Time consumed: t11 → t12 (11:45–12:00).

15) (advance-time t12 t13)
    - Action: Wait until William's availability begins.
    - Time consumed: t12 → t13 (12:00–12:15).
    - Cumulative waiting at The Castro: t2 → t13 = 09:30–12:15 = 11 ticks = 165 minutes (2h45).

16) (begin-meeting traveler thecastro t13)
    - Action: Begin the meeting with William at The Castro.
    - Timestamp: initiation at t13 = 12:15.
    - Note: begin-meeting does not consume time itself; meeting ticks are consumed by meeting-step actions.

17) (meeting-step-1 traveler thecastro t13 t14)
    - Action: Meeting tick 1 (consumes first 15-minute meeting interval).
    - Time consumed: t13 → t14 (12:15–12:30).

18) (meeting-step-2 traveler thecastro t14 t15)
    - Action: Meeting tick 2.
    - Time consumed: t14 → t15 (12:30–12:45).

19) (meeting-step-3 traveler thecastro t15 t16)
    - Action: Meeting tick 3.
    - Time consumed: t15 → t16 (12:45–13:00).

20) (meeting-step-4 traveler thecastro t16 t17)
    - Action: Meeting tick 4.
    - Time consumed: t16 → t17 (13:00–13:15).

21) (meeting-step-5 traveler thecastro t17 t18)
    - Action: Meeting tick 5 (final meeting tick).
    - Time consumed: t17 → t18 (13:15–13:30).
    - Result: met_william5 achieved (five contiguous 15-minute ticks = 75 minutes). Meeting completed and engaged cleared.

Final status summary:
- Travel: Nob Hill → The Castro from 09:00 to 09:30 (30 minutes, 2 discrete ticks).
- Waiting at The Castro before meeting: 09:30–12:15 (2 hours 45 minutes).
- Meeting with William: 12:15–13:30 (75 minutes = 5 ticks) — satisfies the hard requirement.
- Final current time: t18 = 13:30.
- Plan cost (as in the plan comment): 21.

1) Wait at Richmond District from 09:00 (minute540) until 14:58 (minute898).
   - Duration: 358 minutes (14:58 − 09:00).
   - Location: Richmond District.

2) Travel Richmond District -> North Beach departing 14:58 (minute898) and arriving 15:15 (minute915).
   - Travel duration: 17 minutes (matches the Richmond District -> North Beach 17-min edge).
   - Location after move: North Beach at 15:15.

3) Meet John at North Beach starting 15:15 (minute915) and finishing 16:30 (minute990).
   - Meeting duration: 75 minutes (meets the required minimum).
   - John’s availability respected (15:15 start, ends at 16:30 which is ≤ 17:15).

Outcome: Goal achieved — met John for 75 minutes at North Beach (15:15–16:30).

FINAL-PLAN
------------------------------
I can produce the requested FastDownward-compatible PDDL domain and problem, but I don’t have the concrete audited_schedules, the directed travel_time_matrix, or the full preference_profile in the messages so far. I must not invent travel times, schedule entries, or additional friends beyond what you provided. To construct a correct, non‑ambiguous planning instance I need those inputs.

Please provide the following exact items (examples of formats below) and I will produce the full PDDL domain and problem that:
- discretizes time in minute steps between 08:00 and 15:00,
- includes time-step objects and successor (next) links,
- enforces Stephanie’s availability window strictly (08:00–15:00),
- encodes directed travel durations exactly,
- starts the agent at Chinatown at 09:00,
- compiles move actions to consume the appropriate number of minute steps,
- compiles meet-stephanie so that meeting minute steps are contiguous and count toward the required 105 consecutive minutes,
- enforces that the planner must select among the audited schedules by maximizing friends_met_count (Stephanie) and breaking ties by minimizing total_travel_minutes + total_wait_minutes (I will use action-costs and metric if you confirm optimization is desired),
- contains explicit goals fixing final terminal conditions and the 105 consecutive meeting-minute requirement.

What I need from you
1. Locations: a complete list of named locations (e.g., Chinatown, Cafe-A, Park). If Stephanie is always in a particular location(s), include those locations.
2. Directed travel_time_matrix: a list of directed edges with integer minute durations. Format example:
   - Chinatown -> Park : 10
   - Park -> Chinatown : 12
   - Park -> Cafe-A : 5
   Only include the directed pairs that exist; do not omit any pair if an edge is intended.
3. Audited_schedules: the candidate schedules to choose from. For each audited schedule, give:
   - schedule id (e.g., sched1),
   - for each minute time-step (or time interval) within 08:00–15:00, where Stephanie will be located or “unavailable”.
   Example formats:
   - By intervals: sched1: 08:00–09:30 at Park; 09:30–12:00 at Cafe-A; 12:00–15:00 unavailable.
   - Or by per-minute mapping if you prefer full discretization.
   I will enforce that the chosen audited schedule is followed exactly (no deviations).
4. Preference profile clarifications (if any): You said treat natural-language preferences as hard constraints. Please confirm:
   - Whether maximizing friends_met_count strictly means choose the schedule that yields the greatest total minutes of meeting Stephanie (subject to the 105 consecutive minute requirement), or whether other tie-breaking rules apply.
   - Confirm you want ties broken by minimizing (total_travel_minutes + total_wait_minutes). I will encode this as an optimization objective using action costs (increase effects) and a metric in the problem if you confirm.
5. Confirm optimization: do you want me to produce a cost metric for FastDownward (to maximize minutes met and then minimize travel+wait), or do you want only a feasibility formulation that forces at least 105 consecutive meeting minutes and leaves schedule selection implicit? If you want optimization, I will add :action-costs to :requirements and use (increase (total-cost) ...) effects and a metric in the problem.

Example minimal reply you could paste back
- Locations: Chinatown, Park, CafeA
- Travel times:
  - Chinatown -> Park : 10
  - Park -> Chinatown : 12
  - Park -> CafeA : 5
  - CafeA -> Park : 6
- Audited schedules:
  - schedA: Stephanie at Park from 08:00–11:00, at CafeA 11:00–15:00
  - schedB: Stephanie at CafeA 08:00–09:00, at Park 09:00–15:00
- Preference profile: maximize total minutes meeting Stephanie; ties minimize travel+wait
- Confirm optimization: yes, use action-costs and metric

Once you provide the concrete travel matrix and audited schedules (and confirm whether you want the optimization metric), I will produce the full PDDL domain and problem enclosed exactly as requested within:
<domain> ... </domain>
<problem> ... </problem>

I will ensure:
- only :strips, :typing, and :negative-preconditions (and :action-costs if optimization is requested) are in :requirements,
- explicit per-minute time-step objects and successor links,
- actions move, wait, and meet-stephanie compiled to respect directed durations and the 08:00–15:00 window,
- the initial state places the agent at Chinatown at 09:00,
- the goal requires 105 distinct consecutive minute steps of meeting Stephanie,
- no invented travel times, locations, or extra friends.

Travel uses the direction-dependent 16-minute travel time. The plan is simple (one meeting), punctual (arrives exactly at James' start time), and minimizes unnecessary travel."

Travel uses the direction-dependent 16-minute travel time. The plan is simple (one meeting), punctual (arrives exactly at James' start time), and minimizes unnecessary travel."

NATURAL-PLAN sas_plan_5
------------------------------
1) Wait at Golden Gate Park — from 09:00 to 09:59 (duration 59 minutes).  
   (corresponds to: wait t540 t599 golden_gate_park)

2) Travel from Golden Gate Park to Marina District — depart 09:59, arrive 10:15 (duration 16 minutes).  
   (corresponds to: travel t599 t615 golden_gate_park marina_district)

3) Meet James at Marina District — from 10:15 to 10:30 (duration 15 minutes).  
   This satisfies the required minimum 15-minute meeting within James’s availability window.  
   (corresponds to: meet-james t615 t630 marina_district)

Result: Goal achieved — met James.

Summary:
- The plan departs Nob Hill at 09:00, arrives Sunset District by 09:30 (travel cost 25 minutes, charged once).
- The agent waits at Sunset District through 14:00, then meets Carol for three contiguous 30‑minute slots (14:00–15:30), totaling 90 minutes contiguous meeting time (which satisfies the requirement of at least 75 minutes).
- All meeting slots fall inside Carol’s availability window (14:00–20:30).
- Total minimized objective (total-cost) = 25 (minutes of travel).

}
================================================================================


NATURAL-PLAN sas_plan_10
------------------------------
1) Wait at North Beach
   - From 09:00 until 17:44 (duration 8 h 44 m = 524 minutes).
   - Remain located at North Beach; clock advances to 17:44.

2) Travel: North Beach → Alamo Square
   - Depart 17:44, arrive 18:00 (travel duration 16 minutes).
   - Travel duration matches the given distance matrix (North Beach → Alamo Square = 16 min).
   - After this step: located at Alamo Square; clock = 18:00.

3) Meet Barbara at Alamo Square
   - From 18:00 until 21:30 (duration 3 h 30 m = 210 minutes).
   - Meeting occurs entirely within Barbara’s availability window (18:00–21:30) and satisfies the required minimum meeting time (≥ 90 minutes).
   - After this step: Barbara is marked as met; clock = 21:30.

Summary / final state
- Total travel time: 16 minutes.
- Total idle/wait time before travel: 524 minutes.
- Total meaningful meeting time with Barbara: 210 minutes.
- Final conditions satisfied: at Alamo Square, time = 21:30, and Barbara met.
