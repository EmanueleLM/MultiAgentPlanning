Tick-to-time mapping used below:
- t0 = 09:00, t1 = 09:15, t2 = 09:30, t3 = 09:45, t4 = 10:00, t5 = 10:15, t6 = 10:30, t7 = 10:45, t8 = 11:00, t9 = 11:15, t10 = 11:30, t11 = 11:45, t12 = 12:00, t13 = 12:15, t14 = 12:30, t15 = 12:45, t16 = 13:00, t17 = 13:15, t18 = 13:30.

Plan steps (exact correspondence to the PDDL plan):

1) (begin-travel traveler nobhill thecastro t0)
   - Action: Begin travel from Nob Hill to The Castro.
   - Timestamp: started at t0 = 09:00.
   - Note: marks departure; does not advance the current time by itself.

2) (travel-step-1 traveler nobhill thecastro t0 t1)
   - Action: Travel step 1 (first 15-minute travel tick).
   - Time consumed: t0 → t1 (09:00–09:15).

3) (travel-step-2 traveler nobhill thecastro t1 t2)
   - Action: Travel step 2 (second 15-minute travel tick).
   - Time consumed: t1 → t2 (09:15–09:30).
   - Result: travel_done; arrival tick will be t2.

4) (arrive traveler nobhill thecastro t2)
   - Action: Finalize arrival at The Castro.
   - Timestamp: arrival confirmed at t2 = 09:30.
   - Travel summary: conservative rounded travel duration = 2 ticks = 30 minutes (09:00–09:30).

5) (advance-time t2 t3)
   - Action: Wait / advance time at The Castro.
   - Time consumed: t2 → t3 (09:30–09:45).

6) (advance-time t3 t4)
   - Action: Wait.
   - Time consumed: t3 → t4 (09:45–10:00).

7) (advance-time t4 t5)
   - Action: Wait.
   - Time consumed: t4 → t5 (10:00–10:15).

8) (advance-time t5 t6)
   - Action: Wait.
   - Time consumed: t5 → t6 (10:15–10:30).

9) (advance-time t6 t7)
   - Action: Wait.
   - Time consumed: t6 → t7 (10:30–10:45).

10) (advance-time t7 t8)
    - Action: Wait.
    - Time consumed: t7 → t8 (10:45–11:00).

11) (advance-time t8 t9)
    - Action: Wait.
    - Time consumed: t8 → t9 (11:00–11:15).

12) (advance-time t9 t10)
    - Action: Wait.
    - Time consumed: t9 → t10 (11:15–11:30).

13) (advance-time t10 t11)
    - Action: Wait.
    - Time consumed: t10 → t11 (11:30–11:45).

14) (advance-time t11 t12)
    - Action: Wait.
    - Time consumed: t11 → t12 (11:45–12:00).

15) (advance-time t12 t13)
    - Action: Wait until William's availability begins.
    - Time consumed: t12 → t13 (12:00–12:15).
    - Cumulative waiting at The Castro: t2 → t13 = 09:30–12:15 = 11 ticks = 165 minutes (2h45).

16) (begin-meeting traveler thecastro t13)
    - Action: Begin the meeting with William at The Castro.
    - Timestamp: initiation at t13 = 12:15.
    - Note: begin-meeting does not consume time itself; meeting ticks are consumed by meeting-step actions.

17) (meeting-step-1 traveler thecastro t13 t14)
    - Action: Meeting tick 1 (consumes first 15-minute meeting interval).
    - Time consumed: t13 → t14 (12:15–12:30).

18) (meeting-step-2 traveler thecastro t14 t15)
    - Action: Meeting tick 2.
    - Time consumed: t14 → t15 (12:30–12:45).

19) (meeting-step-3 traveler thecastro t15 t16)
    - Action: Meeting tick 3.
    - Time consumed: t15 → t16 (12:45–13:00).

20) (meeting-step-4 traveler thecastro t16 t17)
    - Action: Meeting tick 4.
    - Time consumed: t16 → t17 (13:00–13:15).

21) (meeting-step-5 traveler thecastro t17 t18)
    - Action: Meeting tick 5 (final meeting tick).
    - Time consumed: t17 → t18 (13:15–13:30).
    - Result: met_william5 achieved (five contiguous 15-minute ticks = 75 minutes). Meeting completed and engaged cleared.

Final status summary:
- Travel: Nob Hill → The Castro from 09:00 to 09:30 (30 minutes, 2 discrete ticks).
- Waiting at The Castro before meeting: 09:30–12:15 (2 hours 45 minutes).
- Meeting with William: 12:15–13:30 (75 minutes = 5 ticks) — satisfies the hard requirement.
- Final current time: t18 = 13:30.
- Plan cost (as in the plan comment): 21.
