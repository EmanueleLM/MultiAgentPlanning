Plan (15 moves). Each move is 1 time unit. Timestamps show start time -> end time.

Initial state: right peg (top->bottom) = diskA, diskB, diskC, diskD; left and middle empty.

1) t=0 → t=1: Move diskA from right (on top of diskB) to middle (peg empty).
2) t=1 → t=2: Move diskB from right (on top of diskC) to left (peg empty).
3) t=2 → t=3: Move diskA from middle (on peg) onto diskB on left.
4) t=3 → t=4: Move diskC from right (on top of diskD) to middle (peg empty).
5) t=4 → t=5: Move diskA from left (on top of diskB) onto diskD on right.
6) t=5 → t=6: Move diskB from left (peg) onto diskC on middle.
7) t=6 → t=7: Move diskA from right (on top of diskD) onto diskB on middle.
8) t=7 → t=8: Move diskD from right (peg) to left (peg empty).
9) t=8 → t=9: Move diskA from middle (on top of diskB) onto diskD on left.
10) t=9 → t=10: Move diskB from middle (on top of diskC) to right (peg empty).
11) t=10 → t=11: Move diskA from left (on top of diskD) onto diskB on right.
12) t=11 → t=12: Move diskC from middle (peg) onto diskD on left.
13) t=12 → t=13: Move diskA from right (on top of diskB) to middle (peg empty).
14) t=13 → t=14: Move diskB from right (peg) onto diskC on left.
15) t=14 → t=15: Move diskA from middle (peg) onto diskB on left.

Final state (t=15): left peg top→bottom = diskA, diskB, diskC, diskD; middle empty; right empty.
Total duration: 15 time units.

This sequence follows the Tower of Hanoi rules: one disk moved at a time, always moving a top disk, and never placing a larger disk on a smaller disk.
