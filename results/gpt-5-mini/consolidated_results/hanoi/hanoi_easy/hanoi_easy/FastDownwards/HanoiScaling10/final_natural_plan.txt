Assumption: each atomic move takes 1s. Timestamps start at t=0s and increment by 1s per move. (Total moves = 15, total time = 15s, total cost = 15.)

1) t = 0s → 1s (duration 1s)
   Move disk A from on top of disk B (middle peg) to the left peg.

2) t = 1s → 2s (duration 1s)
   Move disk B from on top of disk C (middle peg) to the right peg.

3) t = 2s → 3s (duration 1s)
   Move disk A from the left peg onto disk B (on the right peg).

4) t = 3s → 4s (duration 1s)
   Move disk C from on top of disk D (middle peg) to the left peg.

5) t = 4s → 5s (duration 1s)
   Move disk A from on top of disk B (right peg) onto disk D (middle peg).

6) t = 5s → 6s (duration 1s)
   Move disk B from the right peg onto disk C (left peg).

7) t = 6s → 7s (duration 1s)
   Move disk A from on top of disk D (middle peg) onto disk B (left peg).

8) t = 7s → 8s (duration 1s)
   Move disk D from the middle peg to the right peg.

9) t = 8s → 9s (duration 1s)
   Move disk A from on top of disk B (left peg) onto disk D (right peg).

10) t = 9s → 10s (duration 1s)
    Move disk B from on top of disk C (left peg) to the middle peg.

11) t = 10s → 11s (duration 1s)
    Move disk A from on top of disk D (right peg) onto disk B (middle peg).

12) t = 11s → 12s (duration 1s)
    Move disk C from the left peg onto disk D (right peg).

13) t = 12s → 13s (duration 1s)
    Move disk A from on top of disk B (middle peg) to the left peg.

14) t = 13s → 14s (duration 1s)
    Move disk B from the middle peg onto disk C (right peg).

15) t = 14s → 15s (duration 1s)
    Move disk A from the left peg onto disk B (right peg).

Result at t = 15s:
- Right peg holds (top → bottom): A, B, C, D (A on B, B on C, C on D).
- Left peg empty; Middle peg empty.
- All moves respect the single-disk, top-of-peg, and no-larger-on-smaller rules.
- Total moves (cost) = 15.
