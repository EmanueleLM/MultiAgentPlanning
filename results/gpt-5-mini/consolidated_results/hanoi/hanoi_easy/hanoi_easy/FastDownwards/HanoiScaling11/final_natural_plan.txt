Plan (15 moves). Each step lists the disk moved, source -> destination, and the stage timestamp (sN -> sN+1). Each move is one unit of time.

1. s0 -> s1 (duration 1): Move disk A from B to peg left.
2. s1 -> s2 (duration 1): Move disk B from C to peg right.
3. s2 -> s3 (duration 1): Move disk A from peg left onto disk B.
4. s3 -> s4 (duration 1): Move disk C from D to peg left.
5. s4 -> s5 (duration 1): Move disk A from B onto disk D.
6. s5 -> s6 (duration 1): Move disk B from right onto disk C.
7. s6 -> s7 (duration 1): Move disk A from D onto disk B.
8. s7 -> s8 (duration 1): Move disk D from middle to peg right.
9. s8 -> s9 (duration 1): Move disk A from B onto disk D.
10. s9 -> s10 (duration 1): Move disk B from C to peg middle.
11. s10 -> s11 (duration 1): Move disk A from D onto disk B.
12. s11 -> s12 (duration 1): Move disk C from left onto disk D.
13. s12 -> s13 (duration 1): Move disk A from B to peg left.
14. s13 -> s14 (duration 1): Move disk B from middle onto disk C.
15. s14 -> s15 (duration 1): Move disk A from left onto disk B.

Final state after s15: right peg holds A on B on C on D (A top, D bottom); left and middle pegs are empty; current stage is s15.
