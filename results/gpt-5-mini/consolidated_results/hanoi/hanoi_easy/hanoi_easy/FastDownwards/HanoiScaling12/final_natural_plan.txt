Sequence of human-readable moves (15 steps). Each step shows a timestamp (start → end), the stage advance (sN→sN+1), the primitive move, and a short note of the immediate precondition that enabled the move.

1) t=0.0s → 1.0s (s0 → s1): Move disk A from right to middle.
   - Precondition: A was on top of B on the right; middle was empty.

2) t=1.0s → 2.0s (s1 → s2): Move disk B from right to left.
   - Precondition: B was on top of C on the right (A removed); left was empty.

3) t=2.0s → 3.0s (s2 → s3): Move disk A from middle to left, placing it onto B.
   - Precondition: A was top on middle; B was top on left.

4) t=3.0s → 4.0s (s3 → s4): Move disk C from right to middle.
   - Precondition: C was top on right (above D); middle was empty.

5) t=4.0s → 5.0s (s4 → s5): Move disk A from left to right, placing it onto D.
   - Precondition: A was on top of B on left; D was top (and only disk) on right.

6) t=5.0s → 6.0s (s5 → s6): Move disk B from left to middle, placing it onto C.
   - Precondition: B became top on left after A moved; C was top on middle.

7) t=6.0s → 7.0s (s6 → s7): Move disk A from right to middle, placing it onto B.
   - Precondition: A was top on right; B was top on middle.

8) t=7.0s → 8.0s (s7 → s8): Move disk D from right to left.
   - Precondition: D was the only disk on right (top); left was empty.

9) t=8.0s → 9.0s (s8 → s9): Move disk A from middle to left, placing it onto D.
   - Precondition: A was top on middle; D was top on left.

10) t=9.0s → 10.0s (s9 → s10): Move disk B from middle to right.
    - Precondition: B was on top of C on middle (A removed); right was empty.

11) t=10.0s → 11.0s (s10 → s11): Move disk A from left to right, placing it onto B.
    - Precondition: A was top on left; B was top on right.

12) t=11.0s → 12.0s (s11 → s12): Move disk C from middle to left, placing it onto D.
    - Precondition: C was top on middle; D was top on left.

13) t=12.0s → 13.0s (s12 → s13): Move disk A from right to middle.
    - Precondition: A was top on right; middle was empty.

14) t=13.0s → 14.0s (s13 → s14): Move disk B from right to left, placing it onto C.
    - Precondition: B was top on right; C was top on left.

15) t=14.0s → 15.0s (s14 → s15): Move disk A from middle to left, placing it onto B.
    - Precondition: A was top on middle; B was top on left.

Result after step 15 (t=15.0s, current = s15): Left peg holds stack top-to-bottom A, B, C, D; middle and right pegs are empty — goal achieved.
