Mapping of object names
- Disks: d1 = A (smallest), d2 = B, d3 = C, d4 = D (largest)
- Pegs: left, middle, right
Timestamps: moves executed sequentially; each move shown with a nominal timestamp increment (1s per move) and a nominal duration of 1s. Preconditions and postconditions are concise and reflect Tower of Hanoi rules (only top disk moved; cannot place larger on smaller).

Step 1 — t = 00:00:01 (duration 1s)
Action: Move A (d1) from on top of B (d2) → peg left.
Preconditions: A is the top disk on B; left peg is empty (clear).
Postconditions: A is now on peg left; left is no longer empty; B becomes top-most where it sits.

Step 2 — t = 00:00:02 (duration 1s)
Action: Move B (d2) from on top of C (d3) → peg middle.
Preconditions: B is the top disk on C; middle peg is empty (clear).
Postconditions: B is now on peg middle; middle is no longer empty; C becomes top-most where it sits.

Step 3 — t = 00:00:03 (duration 1s)
Action: Move A (d1) from peg left → on top of B (d2).
Preconditions: A is top on left; B is top on middle (and A is smaller than B).
Postconditions: A is now on top of B; left peg becomes empty.

Step 4 — t = 00:00:04 (duration 1s)
Action: Move C (d3) from on top of D (d4) → peg left.
Preconditions: C is the top disk on D; left peg is empty.
Postconditions: C is now on peg left; left is no longer empty; D becomes top-most where it sits.

Step 5 — t = 00:00:05 (duration 1s)
Action: Move A (d1) from on top of B (d2) → on top of D (d4).
Preconditions: A is top on B; D is top on right and larger than A; target (top of D) is clear.
Postconditions: A is now on top of D; previous top statuses updated (B may become top).

Step 6 — t = 00:00:06 (duration 1s)
Action: Move B (d2) from peg middle → on top of C (d3).
Preconditions: B is top on middle; C is top on left and larger than B.
Postconditions: B is now on top of C; middle peg becomes empty.

Step 7 — t = 00:00:07 (duration 1s)
Action: Move A (d1) from on top of D (d4) → on top of B (d2).
Preconditions: A is top on D; B is top on C and larger than A.
Postconditions: A is now on top of B.

Step 8 — t = 00:00:08 (duration 1s)
Action: Move D (d4) from peg right → peg middle.
Preconditions: D is top on right (no disk on top); middle peg is empty.
Postconditions: D is now on peg middle; right peg becomes empty.

Step 9 — t = 00:00:09 (duration 1s)
Action: Move A (d1) from on top of B (d2) → on top of D (d4).
Preconditions: A is top on B; D is top on middle and larger than A.
Postconditions: A is now on top of D.

Step 10 — t = 00:00:10 (duration 1s)
Action: Move B (d2) from on top of C (d3) → peg right.
Preconditions: B is top on C; right peg is empty.
Postconditions: B is now on peg right; C becomes top-most where it sits.

Step 11 — t = 00:00:11 (duration 1s)
Action: Move A (d1) from on top of D (d4) → on top of B (d2).
Preconditions: A is top on D; B is top on right and larger than A.
Postconditions: A is now on top of B.

Step 12 — t = 00:00:12 (duration 1s)
Action: Move C (d3) from peg left → on top of D (d4).
Preconditions: C is top on left; D is top on middle and larger than C.
Postconditions: C is now on top of D; left peg becomes empty.

Step 13 — t = 00:00:13 (duration 1s)
Action: Move A (d1) from on top of B (d2) → peg left.
Preconditions: A is top on B; left peg is empty.
Postconditions: A is now on peg left; left is no longer empty.

Step 14 — t = 00:00:14 (duration 1s)
Action: Move B (d2) from peg right → on top of C (d3).
Preconditions: B is top on right; C is top on middle and larger than B.
Postconditions: B is now on top of C; right peg becomes empty.

Step 15 — t = 00:00:15 (duration 1s) — final move
Action: Move A (d1) from peg left → on top of B (d2).
Preconditions: A is top on left; B is top on C and larger than A.
Postconditions: A is now on top of B.

Final state (after Step 15)
- Middle peg stack from top to bottom: A (d1), B (d2), C (d3), D (d4) — matches required goal order.
- Left peg: empty.
- Right peg: empty.
Audit summary: The 15 moves follow the Tower of Hanoi rules (only top disks moved; never places a larger disk on a smaller disk) and achieve the final goal (all four disks transferred from right peg to middle peg, left peg empty).
