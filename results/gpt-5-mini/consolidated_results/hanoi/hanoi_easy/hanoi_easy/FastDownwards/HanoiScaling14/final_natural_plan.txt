Summary: executing the given 15-move plan (cost = 15). Timestamps are provided as seconds from start (t=0s) with each move taking 1s.

Initial state (top-to-bottom):
- Left: (empty)
- Middle: A, B, C, D
- Right: (empty)

1) t=0s → t=1s — Move disk A from (on) disk B [middle peg] to peg right.
   Rationale: remove top disk A so B becomes free to move.
   State after move:
   - Left: (empty)
   - Middle: B, C, D
   - Right: A

2) t=1s → t=2s — Move disk B from (on) disk C [middle peg] to peg left.
   Rationale: move B to left as part of transferring the three smallest disks.
   State after move:
   - Left: B
   - Middle: C, D
   - Right: A

3) t=2s → t=3s — Move disk A from peg right onto disk B (on left).
   Rationale: stack A on B to preserve ordering while freeing C.
   State after move:
   - Left: A, B
   - Middle: C, D
   - Right: (empty)

4) t=3s → t=4s — Move disk C from (on) disk D [middle peg] to peg right.
   Rationale: move the next larger disk (C) out of the middle peg to free D.
   State after move:
   - Left: A, B
   - Middle: D
   - Right: C

5) t=4s → t=5s — Move disk A from (on) disk B [left] onto disk D [middle].
   Rationale: place A on D to enable subsequent placement of B onto C.
   State after move:
   - Left: B
   - Middle: A, D
   - Right: C

6) t=5s → t=6s — Move disk B from peg left onto disk C (on right).
   Rationale: stack B on C so the smaller disks can be rearranged on the right.
   State after move:
   - Left: (empty)
   - Middle: A, D
   - Right: B, C

7) t=6s → t=7s — Move disk A from (on) disk D [middle] onto disk B (on right).
   Rationale: complete stacking of the three smallest disks on the right (A on B on C).
   State after move:
   - Left: (empty)
   - Middle: D
   - Right: A, B, C

8) t=7s → t=8s — Move disk D from peg middle to peg left.
   Rationale: move the largest disk D to target peg left (foundation for final stack).
   State after move:
   - Left: D
   - Middle: (empty)
   - Right: A, B, C

9) t=8s → t=9s — Move disk A from (on) disk B [right] onto disk D (on left).
   Rationale: begin moving the three smaller disks onto D in final order.
   State after move:
   - Left: A, D
   - Middle: (empty)
   - Right: B, C

10) t=9s → t=10s — Move disk B from (on) disk C [right] to peg middle.
    Rationale: free C and position B so A can be placed on B.
    State after move:
    - Left: A, D
    - Middle: B
    - Right: C

11) t=10s → t=11s — Move disk A from (on) disk D [left] onto disk B (on middle).
    Rationale: stack A on B as an intermediate to place C on D.
    State after move:
    - Left: D
    - Middle: A, B
    - Right: C

12) t=11s → t=12s — Move disk C from peg right onto disk D (on left).
    Rationale: place C onto D, building the bottom part of the final stack on left.
    State after move:
    - Left: C, D
    - Middle: A, B
    - Right: (empty)

13) t=12s → t=13s — Move disk A from (on) disk B [middle] to peg right.
    Rationale: free B so it can be placed onto C.
    State after move:
    - Left: C, D
    - Middle: B
    - Right: A

14) t=13s → t=14s — Move disk B from peg middle onto disk C (on left).
    Rationale: place B onto C so only A remains to complete the final stack.
    State after move:
    - Left: B, C, D
    - Middle: (empty)
    - Right: A

15) t=14s → t=15s — Move disk A from peg right onto disk B (on left).
    Rationale: complete the final ordered stack A on B on C on D on the left peg.
    State after move (final):
    - Left: A, B, C, D
    - Middle: (empty)
    - Right: (empty)

Final check:
- Left (top-to-bottom): A, B, C, D — matches required final stack (A top, D bottom).
- Middle: empty
- Right: empty
- Total moves (cost): 15

This sequence exactly follows the provided plan and respects all Tower of Hanoi rules: only one top disk moved at a time, never placing a larger disk on a smaller disk, and ending with the middle and right pegs empty.
