Initial state (time t=00:00.00, stage s1):
- Left: []
- Middle: [a (top), b, c, d (bottom)]
- Right: []
(Goal: have [a,b,c,d] top->bottom on Right; Left and Middle empty.)

5) t=00:04 → 00:05 (s5 → s6)
Action: (move-disk-to-disk s5 a b d s6)
Plain: Move disk a from on top of disk b (right peg) onto disk d (middle peg).

- Middle: [a (top), d]
- Right: [b]

6) t=00:05 → 00:06 (s6 → s7)
Action: (move-peg-to-disk s6 b right c s7)
Plain: Move disk b from the right peg onto disk c (on the left peg).
Resulting pegs:
- Left: [b (top), c]
- Middle: [a, d]
- Right: []

7) t=00:06 → 00:07 (s7 → s8)
Action: (move-disk-to-disk s7 a d b s8)
Plain: Move disk a from on top of disk d (middle peg) onto disk b (left peg).
Resulting pegs:
- Left: [a (top), b, c]
- Middle: [d]
- Right: []

8) t=00:07 → 00:08 (s8 → s9)
Action: (move-peg-to-peg s8 d middle right s9)
Plain: Move disk d (sole disk on the middle peg) from the middle peg to the empty right peg.
Resulting pegs:
- Left: [a, b, c]
- Middle: []
- Right: [d]

9) t=00:08 → 00:09 (s9 → s10)
Action: (move-disk-to-disk s9 a b d s10)
Plain: Move disk a from on top of disk b (left peg) onto disk d (right peg).
Resulting pegs:
- Left: [b, c]
- Middle: []
- Right: [a (top), d]

10) t=00:09 → 00:10 (s10 → s11)
Action: (move-disk-to-peg s10 b c middle s11)
Plain: Move disk b from on top of disk c (left peg) to the empty middle peg.
Resulting pegs:
- Left: [c]
- Middle: [b]
- Right: [a, d]

11) t=00:10 → 00:11 (s11 → s12)
Action: (move-disk-to-disk s11 a d b s12)
Plain: Move disk a from on top of disk d (right peg) onto disk b (middle peg).
Resulting pegs:
- Left: [c]
- Middle: [a (top), b]
- Right: [d]

12) t=00:11 → 00:12 (s12 → s13)
Action: (move-peg-to-disk s12 c left d s13)
Plain: Move disk c from the left peg onto disk d (right peg).
Resulting pegs:
- Left: []
- Middle: [a, b]
- Right: [c (top), d]

13) t=00:12 → 00:13 (s13 → s14)
Action: (move-disk-to-peg s13 a b left s14)
Plain: Move disk a from on top of disk b (middle peg) to the empty left peg.
Resulting pegs:
- Left: [a]
- Middle: [b]
- Right: [c, d]

14) t=00:13 → 00:14 (s14 → s15)
Action: (move-peg-to-disk s14 b middle c s15)
Plain: Move disk b from the middle peg onto disk c (on the right peg).
Resulting pegs:
- Left: [a]
- Middle: []
- Right: [b (top), c, d]

15) t=00:14 → 00:15 (s15 → s16)
Action: (move-peg-to-peg s15 a left b s16)
Plain: Move disk a from the left peg onto disk b (the top disk on the right peg). (This places a on b at the right peg.)
Resulting pegs (final):
- Left: []
- Middle: []
- Right: [a (top), b, c, d (bottom)]

Final state reached at t=00:15.00 (stage s16): right peg holds disks a,b,c,d top→bottom; left and middle pegs are empty; top disk a is clear — goal satisfied.
