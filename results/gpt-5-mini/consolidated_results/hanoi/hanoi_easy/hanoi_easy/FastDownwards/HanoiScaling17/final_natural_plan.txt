Summary: each move takes one stage transition. I list moves in order, showing the stage transition (sN → sN+1), a timestamp assuming 1 time unit per move (t0 = 0..t15 = 15), the disk moved (using both planner token and human label), source and destination pegs, whether the destination was empty or had a top disk, and a short legality check (top-disk move and size comparison when required). The sequence exactly matches the provided plan (15 moves, final stage s15).

Assumption: 1 move = 1 time unit. Timestamp t=k means the start of stage sk; the move occurs over t=k → t=k+1 and advances current-stage sk → sk+1.

1) [t=0 → 1] Stage s0 → s1:
- Action: mover-move-with-under-to-empty da (disk A) from peg_right to peg_left.
- Context: da was top on peg_right with db underneath; destination peg_left was empty.
- Legality check: moving top disk only; destination empty allowed.
- Effect: da now on peg_left (top and bottom), peg_right remains non-empty (db becomes new top).

2) [t=1 → 2] Stage s1 → s2:
- Action: mover-move-with-under-to-empty db (disk B) from peg_right to peg_mid.
- Context: db was top on peg_right with dc underneath; destination peg_mid was empty.
- Legality check: top-disk move; destination empty allowed.
- Effect: db now on peg_mid (top and bottom); peg_right remains non-empty (dc becomes new top).

3) [t=2 → 3] Stage s2 → s3:
- Action: mover-move-bottom-to-nonempty da (disk A) from peg_left to peg_mid, placing on db.
- Context: da was the sole disk on peg_left (bottom+top). Destination peg_mid had top db.
- Legality check: moving the sole disk from its peg is allowed; A < B so placing A on B is legal.
- Effect: da is now on peg_mid on top of db; peg_left becomes empty.

4) [t=3 → 4] Stage s3 → s4:
- Action: mover-move-with-under-to-empty dc (disk C) from peg_right to peg_left.
- Context: dc was top on peg_right with dd underneath; destination peg_left was empty (after step 3).
- Legality check: top-disk move to an empty peg is allowed.
- Effect: dc is now on peg_left (top and bottom); peg_right remains non-empty (dd becomes new top).

5) [t=4 → 5] Stage s4 → s5:
- Action: mover-move-with-under-to-nonempty da (disk A) from peg_mid to peg_right, placing on dd.
- Context: da was top on peg_mid with db underneath. Destination peg_right had top dd.
- Legality check: A < D, so placing A on D is legal; moving top-disk from non-empty source is allowed.
- Effect: da now on peg_right on top of dd; peg_mid becomes non-empty with db as top.

6) [t=5 → 6] Stage s5 → s6:
- Action: mover-move-bottom-to-nonempty db (disk B) from peg_mid to peg_left, placing on dc.
- Context: db was sole disk on peg_mid (bottom+top) after step 5. Destination peg_left had top dc.
- Legality check: B < C, so placing B on C is legal; moving the sole disk is allowed.
- Effect: db now on peg_left on top of dc; peg_mid becomes empty.

7) [t=6 → 7] Stage s6 → s7:
- Action: mover-move-with-under-to-nonempty da (disk A) from peg_right to peg_left, placing on db.
- Context: da was top on peg_right with dd underneath. Destination peg_left had top db.
- Legality check: A < B, so placing A on B is legal.
- Effect: da now on peg_left on top of db (so left peg stack top→bottom: da, db, dc).

8) [t=7 → 8] Stage s7 → s8:
- Action: mover-move-bottom-to-empty dd (disk D) from peg_right to peg_mid.
- Context: dd was sole disk on peg_right after da moved off; destination peg_mid was empty.
- Legality check: moving sole disk to empty peg allowed.
- Effect: dd now on peg_mid (top and bottom); peg_right becomes empty.

9) [t=8 → 9] Stage s8 → s9:
- Action: mover-move-with-under-to-nonempty da (disk A) from peg_left to peg_mid, placing on dd.
- Context: da was top on peg_left with db underneath. Destination peg_mid had top dd.
- Legality check: A < D, so placing A on D is legal.
- Effect: da now on peg_mid on top of dd; peg_left now has db on dc.

10) [t=9 → 10] Stage s9 → s10:
- Action: mover-move-with-under-to-empty db (disk B) from peg_left to peg_right.
- Context: db was top on peg_left with dc underneath. Destination peg_right was empty (after step 8).
- Legality check: top-disk move to empty peg allowed.
- Effect: db now on peg_right (top and bottom); peg_left becomes non-empty with dc sole disk.

11) [t=10 → 11] Stage s10 → s11:
- Action: mover-move-with-under-to-nonempty da (disk A) from peg_mid to peg_right, placing on db.
- Context: da was top on peg_mid with dd underneath. Destination peg_right had top db.
- Legality check: A < B, placing on db is legal.
- Effect: da now on peg_right on top of db.

12) [t=11 → 12] Stage s11 → s12:
- Action: mover-move-bottom-to-nonempty dc (disk C) from peg_left to peg_mid, placing on dd.
- Context: dc was sole disk on peg_left (after db moved away). Destination peg_mid had top dd.
- Legality check: C < D, so placing C on D is legal; moving sole disk allowed.
- Effect: dc now on peg_mid on top of dd.

13) [t=12 → 13] Stage s12 → s13:
- Action: mover-move-with-under-to-empty da (disk A) from peg_right to peg_left.
- Context: da was top on peg_right with db underneath. Destination peg_left was empty (after dc moved off).
- Legality check: top-disk move to empty peg allowed.
- Effect: da now on peg_left (top and bottom); peg_right now has db as top (possibly sole).

14) [t=13 → 14] Stage s13 → s14:
- Action: mover-move-bottom-to-nonempty db (disk B) from peg_right to peg_mid, placing on dc.
- Context: db was sole disk on peg_right. Destination peg_mid had top dc.
- Legality check: B < C, so placing B on C is legal.
- Effect: db now on peg_mid on top of dc (which is on top of dd).

15) [t=14 → 15] Stage s14 → s15:
- Action: mover-move-bottom-to-nonempty da (disk A) from peg_left to peg_mid, placing on db.
- Context: da was sole disk on peg_left. Destination peg_mid had top db.
- Legality check: A < B, placing A on B is legal.
- Effect: da now on peg_mid on top of db; peg_left and peg_right become empty.

Final state (after t=15 / current-stage s15):
- peg_mid stack top → bottom: da (A), db (B), dc (C), dd (D)
- peg_left: empty
- peg_right: empty
- current-stage = s15
- All moves obeyed the rules: one disk at a time, only top disks moved, and no larger disk was placed on a smaller disk.

Cost: 15 moves (unit cost per move).
