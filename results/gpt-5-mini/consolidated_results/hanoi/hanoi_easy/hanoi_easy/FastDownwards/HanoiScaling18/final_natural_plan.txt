Summary: the following 15-step move sequence exactly matches the provided plan. Each step shows the move in Move(disk, source, target) notation, a short natural-language description, and an assumed timestamp (each move takes 1 time unit). Sizes: d1 < d2 < d3 < d4. Pegs are p1, p2, p3.

Step 1 — t=0 → 1 (duration 1)
Move(d1, d2, p2)
Move top disk d1 (currently on disk d2) from on top of d2 to peg p2.

Step 2 — t=1 → 2 (duration 1)
Move(d2, d3, p3)
Move top disk d2 (currently on disk d3) from on top of d3 to peg p3.

Step 3 — t=2 → 3 (duration 1)
Move(d1, p2, d2)
Move top disk d1 (currently on peg p2) from peg p2 onto disk d2 (on peg p3).

Step 4 — t=3 → 4 (duration 1)
Move(d3, d4, p2)
Move top disk d3 (currently on disk d4) from on top of d4 to peg p2.

Step 5 — t=4 → 5 (duration 1)
Move(d1, d2, d4)
Move top disk d1 (currently on disk d2) from on top of d2 onto disk d4.

Step 6 — t=5 → 6 (duration 1)
Move(d2, p3, d3)
Move top disk d2 (currently on peg p3) from peg p3 onto disk d3 (now on peg p2).

Step 7 — t=6 → 7 (duration 1)
Move(d1, d4, d2)
Move top disk d1 (currently on disk d4) from on top of d4 onto disk d2.

Step 8 — t=7 → 8 (duration 1)
Move(d4, p1, p3)
Move top disk d4 (currently on peg p1) from peg p1 to peg p3.

Step 9 — t=8 → 9 (duration 1)
Move(d1, d2, d4)
Move top disk d1 (currently on disk d2) from on top of d2 onto disk d4.

Step 10 — t=9 → 10 (duration 1)
Move(d2, d3, p1)
Move top disk d2 (currently on disk d3) from on top of d3 to peg p1.

Step 11 — t=10 → 11 (duration 1)
Move(d1, d4, d2)
Move top disk d1 (currently on disk d4) from on top of d4 onto disk d2.

Step 12 — t=11 → 12 (duration 1)
Move(d3, p2, d4)
Move top disk d3 (currently on peg p2) from peg p2 onto disk d4.

Step 13 — t=12 → 13 (duration 1)
Move(d1, d2, p2)
Move top disk d1 (currently on disk d2) from on top of d2 to peg p2.

Step 14 — t=13 → 14 (duration 1)
Move(d2, p1, d3)
Move top disk d2 (currently on peg p1) from peg p1 onto disk d3.

Step 15 — t=14 → 15 (duration 1)
Move(d1, p2, d2)
Move top disk d1 (currently on peg p2) from peg p2 onto disk d2.

Final state (after t=15): tower reassembled on p3 with correct ordering:
- on d1 d2
- on d2 d3
- on d3 d4
- on d4 p3

This satisfies the goal predicates in the PDDL problem. Each step is a single top-disk move, preserves the size ordering (no larger disk placed on a smaller one), and is temporally and causally consistent.
