Mapping of disk names: A = d1 (smallest), B = d2, C = d3, D = d4 (largest).
Each step has duration 1 time unit (one stage advance). States are reported top-to-bottom on each peg (Left / Middle / Right).

1) Step 1 (s0 -> s1), duration 1
- Action: Move disk A (d1) from on top of disk B (d2) to peg Middle.
- Justification: d1 was the top disk on d2; Middle was empty, so placing A on an empty peg is legal.
- Resulting state (top→bottom):
  - Left: (empty)
  - Middle: A
  - Right: B, C, D

2) Step 2 (s1 -> s2), duration 1
- Action: Move disk B (d2) from on top of disk C (d3) to peg Left.
- Justification: d2 was the top disk on d3; Left was empty, so moving B to Left is legal.
- Resulting state:
  - Left: B
  - Middle: A
  - Right: C, D

3) Step 3 (s2 -> s3), duration 1
- Action: Move disk A (d1) from peg Middle onto disk B (d2) on Left.
- Justification: A is the top disk on Middle and A is smaller than B, so placing A on B is legal.
- Resulting state:
  - Left: A, B
  - Middle: (empty)
  - Right: C, D

4) Step 4 (s3 -> s4), duration 1
- Action: Move disk C (d3) from on top of disk D (d4) to peg Middle.
- Justification: d3 was the top disk on d4; Middle is empty, so moving C to Middle is legal.
- Resulting state:
  - Left: A, B
  - Middle: C
  - Right: D

5) Step 5 (s4 -> s5), duration 1
- Action: Move disk A (d1) from on top of disk B (d2) to on top of disk D (d4) on Right.
- Justification: A was top on B; D is larger than A, so placing A on D is legal.
- Resulting state:
  - Left: B
  - Middle: C
  - Right: A, D

6) Step 6 (s5 -> s6), duration 1
- Action: Move disk B (d2) from peg Left onto disk C (d3) on Middle.
- Justification: B was the top (and only) disk on Left; C is larger than B, so placing B on C is legal.
- Resulting state:
  - Left: (empty)
  - Middle: B, C
  - Right: A, D

7) Step 7 (s6 -> s7), duration 1
- Action: Move disk A (d1) from on top of disk D (d4) to on top of disk B (d2) on Middle.
- Justification: A was top on D; B is larger than A, so placing A on B is legal.
- Resulting state:
  - Left: (empty)
  - Middle: A, B, C
  - Right: D

8) Step 8 (s7 -> s8), duration 1
- Action: Move disk D (d4) from peg Right to peg Left.
- Justification: D was the top (and only) disk on Right; Left is empty, so moving D to Left is legal.
- Resulting state:
  - Left: D
  - Middle: A, B, C
  - Right: (empty)

9) Step 9 (s8 -> s9), duration 1
- Action: Move disk A (d1) from on top of disk B (d2) to on top of disk D (d4) on Left.
- Justification: A was top on B; D is larger than A, so placing A on D is legal.
- Resulting state:
  - Left: A, D
  - Middle: B, C
  - Right: (empty)

10) Step 10 (s9 -> s10), duration 1
- Action: Move disk B (d2) from on top of disk C (d3) to peg Right.
- Justification: B was top on C; Right is empty, so moving B to Right is legal.
- Resulting state:
  - Left: A, D
  - Middle: C
  - Right: B

11) Step 11 (s10 -> s11), duration 1
- Action: Move disk A (d1) from on top of disk D (d4) to on top of disk B (d2) on Right.
- Justification: A was top on D; B is larger than A, so placing A on B is legal.
- Resulting state:
  - Left: D
  - Middle: C
  - Right: A, B

12) Step 12 (s11 -> s12), duration 1
- Action: Move disk C (d3) from peg Middle onto disk D (d4) on Left.
- Justification: C was the top (and only) disk on Middle; D is larger than C, so placing C on D is legal.
- Resulting state:
  - Left: C, D
  - Middle: (empty)
  - Right: A, B

13) Step 13 (s12 -> s13), duration 1
- Action: Move disk A (d1) from on top of disk B (d2) to peg Middle.
- Justification: A was top on B; Middle is empty, so moving A to Middle is legal.
- Resulting state:
  - Left: C, D
  - Middle: A
  - Right: B

14) Step 14 (s13 -> s14), duration 1
- Action: Move disk B (d2) from peg Right onto disk C (d3) on Left.
- Justification: B was the top (and only) disk on Right; C is larger than B, so placing B on C is legal.
- Resulting state:
  - Left: B, C, D
  - Middle: A
  - Right: (empty)

15) Step 15 (s14 -> s15), duration 1
- Action: Move disk A (d1) from peg Middle onto disk B (d2) on Left.
- Justification: A was top on Middle; B is larger than A, so placing A on B is legal.
- Resulting state (final):
  - Left: A, B, C, D
  - Middle: (empty)
  - Right: (empty)
- Final verification: All disks moved to Left in correct order (top→bottom A, B, C, D), Middle and Right are empty, and the plan has advanced to s15 as required.

Total moves: 15 (one unit of time each), final state matches the specified goal.
