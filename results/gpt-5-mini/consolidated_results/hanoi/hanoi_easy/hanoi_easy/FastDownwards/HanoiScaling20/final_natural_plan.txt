5) Time 5 (step5 -> step6), duration 1
Action: move_from_disk_to_disk a b d middle right
- Move disk a from on top of b at middle onto disk d at right (a -> on d).
Resulting pegs:
- Left: [c]
- Middle: [b]
- Right: [a, d]

6) Time 6 (step6 -> step7), duration 1
Action: move_from_peg_to_disk b middle left c
- Move disk b from peg middle onto disk c at left (b -> on c).

- Left: [b, c]
- Middle: []
- Right: [a, d]

7) Time 7 (step7 -> step8), duration 1
Action: move_from_disk_to_disk a d b right left
- Move disk a from on top of d at right onto disk b at left (a -> on b).
Resulting pegs:
- Left: [a, b, c]
- Middle: []
- Right: [d]

8) Time 8 (step8 -> step9), duration 1
Action: move_from_peg_to_empty d right middle
- Move disk d from peg right to the empty peg middle.
Resulting pegs:
- Left: [a, b, c]
- Middle: [d]
- Right: []

9) Time 9 (step9 -> step10), duration 1
Action: move_from_disk_to_disk a b d left middle
- Move disk a from on top of b at left onto disk d at middle (a -> on d).
Resulting pegs:
- Left: [b, c]
- Middle: [a, d]
- Right: []

10) Time 10 (step10 -> step11), duration 1
Action: move_from_disk_to_empty b c left right
- Move disk b from on top of c at left to the empty peg right.
Resulting pegs:
- Left: [c]
- Middle: [a, d]
- Right: [b]

11) Time 11 (step11 -> step12), duration 1
Action: move_from_disk_to_disk a d b middle right
- Move disk a from on top of d at middle onto disk b at right (a -> on b).
Resulting pegs:
- Left: [c]
- Middle: [d]
- Right: [a, b]

12) Time 12 (step12 -> step13), duration 1
Action: move_from_peg_to_disk c left middle d
- Move disk c from peg left onto disk d at middle (c -> on d).
Resulting pegs:
- Left: []
- Middle: [c, d]
- Right: [a, b]

13) Time 13 (step13 -> step14), duration 1
Action: move_from_disk_to_empty a b right left
- Move disk a from on top of b at right to the empty peg left.
Resulting pegs:
- Left: [a]
- Middle: [c, d]
- Right: [b]

14) Time 14 (step14 -> step15), duration 1
Action: move_from_peg_to_disk b right middle c
- Move disk b from peg right onto disk c at middle (b -> on c).
Resulting pegs:
- Left: [a]
- Middle: [b, c, d]
- Right: []

15) Time 15 (step15 -> step16), duration 1
Action: move_from_peg_to_disk a left middle b
- Move disk a from peg left onto disk b at middle (a -> on b).
Resulting pegs (final):
- Left: []
- Middle: [a, b, c, d] (top -> bottom: a on b on c on d)
- Right: []

Summary and verification:
- Number of moves: 15 (each duration 1 time unit; final current-step is step16).
- All moves respect Tower of Hanoi rules: only top disks moved, never placing a larger disk on a smaller one.
- Final goal satisfied: middle peg holds a,b,c,d top-to-bottom; left and right pegs are empty.
