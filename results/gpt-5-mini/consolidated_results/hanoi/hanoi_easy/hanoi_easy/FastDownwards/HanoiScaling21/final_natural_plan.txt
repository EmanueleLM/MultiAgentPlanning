Here is a clear, step-by-step, human-readable replay of the given plan. Each step matches the plan exactly, shows the stage transition (sX -> sY), an approximate timestamp assuming each move takes 1 second, and the resulting peg contents after the move (top -> bottom).

Initial state (before step 1, current s0, time 00:00:00):
- left: a, b, c, d (top->bottom)
- mid: (empty)
- right: (empty)

- Action: Move disk a from mid onto disk d on left.
- Plan action: (move-from-disk-to-disk a b mid left d s4 s5)
- Resulting pegs:
  - left: a, d
  - mid: b
  - right: c

Step 6 (s5 -> s6) [00:00:05 → 00:00:06]:
- Action: Move disk b from mid onto disk c on right.
- Plan action: (move-from-peg-to-disk b mid right c s5 s6)
- Resulting pegs:
  - left: a, d
  - mid: (empty)
  - right: b, c

Step 7 (s6 -> s7) [00:00:06 → 00:00:07]:
- Action: Move disk a from left onto disk b on right.
- Plan action: (move-from-disk-to-disk a d left right b s6 s7)
- Resulting pegs:
  - left: d
  - mid: (empty)
  - right: a, b, c

Step 8 (s7 -> s8) [00:00:07 → 00:00:08]:
- Action: Move disk d from left to mid.
- Plan action: (move-from-peg-to-empty d left mid s7 s8)
- Resulting pegs:
  - left: (empty)
  - mid: d
  - right: a, b, c

Step 9 (s8 -> s9) [00:00:08 → 00:00:09]:
- Action: Move disk a from right onto disk d on mid.
- Plan action: (move-from-disk-to-disk a b right mid d s8 s9)
- Resulting pegs:
  - left: (empty)
  - mid: a, d
  - right: b, c

Step 10 (s9 -> s10) [00:00:09 → 00:00:10]:
- Action: Move disk b from right to left.
- Plan action: (move-from-disk-to-empty b c right left s9 s10)
- Resulting pegs:
  - left: b
  - mid: a, d
  - right: c

Step 11 (s10 -> s11) [00:00:10 → 00:00:11]:
- Action: Move disk a from mid onto disk b on left.
- Plan action: (move-from-disk-to-disk a d mid left b s10 s11)
- Resulting pegs:
  - left: a, b
  - mid: d
  - right: c

Step 12 (s11 -> s12) [00:00:11 → 00:00:12]:
- Action: Move disk c from right onto disk d on mid.
- Plan action: (move-from-peg-to-disk c right mid d s11 s12)
- Resulting pegs:
  - left: a, b
  - mid: c, d
  - right: (empty)

Step 13 (s12 -> s13) [00:00:12 → 00:00:13]:
- Action: Move disk a from left to right.
- Plan action: (move-from-disk-to-empty a b left right s12 s13)
- Resulting pegs:
  - left: b
  - mid: c, d
  - right: a

Step 14 (s13 -> s14) [00:00:13 → 00:00:14]:
- Action: Move disk b from left onto disk c on mid.
- Plan action: (move-from-peg-to-disk b left mid c s13 s14)
- Resulting pegs:
  - left: (empty)
  - mid: b, c, d
  - right: a

Step 15 (s14 -> s15) [00:00:14 → 00:00:15]:
- Action: Move disk a from right onto disk b on mid.
- Plan action: (move-from-peg-to-disk a right mid b s14 s15)
- Resulting pegs:
  - left: (empty)
  - mid: a, b, c, d (top->bottom)
  - right: (empty)
- Final stage: current s15 (goal stage reached)

Summary / Goal check:
- After these 15 moves (cost = 15, one unit per move), the final state is exactly the goal:
  - mid holds a, b, c, d (top->bottom)
  - left and right are empty
  - current stage is s15

This sequence exactly follows the provided plan and respects the Tower of Hanoi rules at every step.
