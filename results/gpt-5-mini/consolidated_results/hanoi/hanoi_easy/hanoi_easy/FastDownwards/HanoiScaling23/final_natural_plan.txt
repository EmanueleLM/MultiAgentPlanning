Summary / notation
- Disk names in the PDDL: d1 (smallest), d2, d3, d4 (largest). (These correspond to the spec’s smallest→largest A→D.)
- Pegs: left, mid, right.
- Each plan step advances the stage/timestamp from sN to sN+1. I show that as "time sN → sN+1". Each move is a single-stage primitive action executed by agent "mover".
- Preconditions implicit in each step: the moved disk is top/clear, the source relation (on-peg or on-disk) holds, and the destination is either empty or has a clear disk larger than the moved disk.

Plan (15 moves, final time s0 → s15)

1) time s0 → s1 — move-disk-to-peg mover d1 d2 mid
   - Action: Move disk d1 (the smallest) that is on top of disk d2, to the mid peg (which is empty).
   - Agent: mover.

2) time s1 → s2 — move-disk-to-peg mover d2 d3 right
   - Action: Move disk d2 (next smallest), which is on top of disk d3, to the right peg (empty).
   - Agent: mover.

3) time s2 → s3 — move-peg-to-disk mover d1 mid d2
   - Action: Move disk d1 from the mid peg and place it on top of disk d2 (on the right peg). Destination disk d2 is clear and larger than d1.
   - Agent: mover.

4) time s3 → s4 — move-disk-to-peg mover d3 d4 mid
   - Action: Move disk d3 (on top of d4) to the mid peg (empty).
   - Agent: mover.

5) time s4 → s5 — move-disk-to-disk mover d1 d2 d4
   - Action: Move disk d1 (currently on d2) and place it on top of disk d4 (the largest). Destination d4 is clear and larger.
   - Agent: mover.

6) time s5 → s6 — move-peg-to-disk mover d2 right d3
   - Action: Move disk d2 from the right peg and place it on top of disk d3 (on the mid peg). Destination d3 is clear and larger than d2.
   - Agent: mover.

7) time s6 → s7 — move-disk-to-disk mover d1 d4 d2
   - Action: Move disk d1 (on d4) and place it on top of disk d2 (now on d3). Destination d2 is clear and larger.
   - Agent: mover.

8) time s7 → s8 — move-peg-to-peg mover d4 left right
   - Action: Move disk d4 (bottommost on left) from the left peg directly to the right peg (which is empty at that moment).
   - Agent: mover.

9) time s8 → s9 — move-disk-to-disk mover d1 d2 d4
   - Action: Move disk d1 (on d2) and place it on top of disk d4 (now on right). Destination d4 is clear and larger.
   - Agent: mover.

10) time s9 → s10 — move-disk-to-peg mover d2 d3 left
    - Action: Move disk d2 (on d3) to the left peg (empty).
    - Agent: mover.

11) time s10 → s11 — move-disk-to-disk mover d1 d4 d2
    - Action: Move disk d1 (on d4) and place it on top of disk d2 (now on left). Destination d2 is clear and larger.
    - Agent: mover.

12) time s11 → s12 — move-peg-to-disk mover d3 mid d4
    - Action: Move disk d3 from the mid peg and place it on top of disk d4 (on the right peg). Destination d4 is clear and larger.
    - Agent: mover.

13) time s12 → s13 — move-disk-to-peg mover d1 d2 mid
    - Action: Move disk d1 (on d2) to the mid peg (empty).
    - Agent: mover.

14) time s13 → s14 — move-peg-to-disk mover d2 left d3
    - Action: Move disk d2 from the left peg and place it on top of disk d3 (on the right peg). Destination d3 is clear and larger.
    - Agent: mover.

15) time s14 → s15 — move-peg-to-disk mover d1 mid d2
    - Action: Move disk d1 from the mid peg and place it on top of disk d2 (now on the right peg). Destination d2 is clear and larger.
    - Agent: mover.

Outcome at time s15
- Final stack on right (top → bottom): d1, d2, d3, d4.
- Pegs left and mid are empty.
- Top disk d1 is clear.
- Final stage s15 is reached.
- This sequence is exactly the 15-step plan provided (cost = 15) and respects the Tower of Hanoi rules (only top disks moved; never place larger on smaller).
