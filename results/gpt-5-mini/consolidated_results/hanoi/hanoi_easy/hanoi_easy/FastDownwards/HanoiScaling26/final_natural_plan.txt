Initial state (time 0):
- Left peg: empty
- Middle peg: top -> A, B, C, D (A is smallest, on top; D is largest, bottom)
- Right peg: empty

All moves take 1 time unit (stage t -> t+1). Steps follow the provided plan exactly.

1) time 0 → 1 (duration 1)
Move disk A from middle peg to right peg.
Resulting state:
- Left: empty
- Middle: top -> B, C, D
- Right: top -> A

2) time 1 → 2 (duration 1)
Move disk B from middle peg to left peg.
Resulting state:
- Left: top -> B
- Middle: top -> C, D
- Right: top -> A

3) time 2 → 3 (duration 1)
Move disk A from right peg to left peg (onto disk B).
Resulting state:
- Left: top -> A, B
- Middle: top -> C, D
- Right: empty

4) time 3 → 4 (duration 1)
Move disk C from middle peg to right peg.
Resulting state:
- Left: top -> A, B
- Middle: top -> D
- Right: top -> C

5) time 4 → 5 (duration 1)
Move disk A from left peg to middle peg (onto disk D).
Resulting state:
- Left: top -> B
- Middle: top -> A, D
- Right: top -> C

6) time 5 → 6 (duration 1)
Move disk B from left peg to right peg (onto disk C).
Resulting state:
- Left: empty
- Middle: top -> A, D
- Right: top -> B, C

7) time 6 → 7 (duration 1)
Move disk A from middle peg to right peg (onto disk B).
Resulting state:
- Left: empty
- Middle: top -> D
- Right: top -> A, B, C

8) time 7 → 8 (duration 1)
Move disk D from middle peg to left peg.
Resulting state:
- Left: top -> D
- Middle: empty
- Right: top -> A, B, C

9) time 8 → 9 (duration 1)
Move disk A from right peg to left peg (onto disk D).
Resulting state:
- Left: top -> A, D
- Middle: empty
- Right: top -> B, C

10) time 9 → 10 (duration 1)
Move disk B from right peg to middle peg.
Resulting state:
- Left: top -> A, D
- Middle: top -> B
- Right: top -> C

11) time 10 → 11 (duration 1)
Move disk A from left peg to middle peg (onto disk B).
Resulting state:
- Left: top -> D
- Middle: top -> A, B
- Right: top -> C

12) time 11 → 12 (duration 1)
Move disk C from right peg to left peg (onto disk D).
Resulting state:
- Left: top -> C, D
- Middle: top -> A, B
- Right: empty

13) time 12 → 13 (duration 1)
Move disk A from middle peg to right peg.
Resulting state:
- Left: top -> C, D
- Middle: top -> B
- Right: top -> A

14) time 13 → 14 (duration 1)
Move disk B from middle peg to left peg (onto disk C).
Resulting state:
- Left: top -> B, C, D
- Middle: empty
- Right: top -> A

15) time 14 → 15 (duration 1)
Move disk A from right peg to left peg (onto disk B).
Resulting (final) state:
- Left: top -> A, B, C, D  (goal achieved: A top, then B, C, D)
- Middle: empty
- Right: empty
- Current stage: stage15 reached

Total moves: 15 (each move 1 time unit). All moves follow the rules: only the top disk moved each time and no larger disk was placed on a smaller disk.
