Summary: 15 sequential moves (each 1 time unit) implementing the provided plan. Disks: A = diska (smallest), B = diskb, C = diskc, D = diskd (largest). Pegs: left, middle, right. Each step lists the plan action, the stage transition, a short English description, the key precondition used, and the immediate effect on the pegs. Time proceeds in integer units: Move n occurs t = n-1s → n s.

1) t=0s → 1s
   Action: (mover-move-disk-to-peg diska diskb middle)  stage0 → stage1

   Precondition satisfied: A is top on B; D is top on right; A is smaller than D.
   Effect: right: A on D (A top, D under it). left: B becomes top (A removed). middle: C.

6) t=5s → 6s
   Action: (mover-move-peg-to-disk diskb left diskc)  stage5 → stage6
   Description: Move disk B from the left peg onto disk C (top of middle).
   Precondition satisfied: B is top on left; C is top on middle; B is smaller than C.
   Effect: middle: B on C (B top, C under it). left: empty. right: A on D.

7) t=6s → 7s
   Action: (mover-move-disk-to-disk diska diskd diskb)  stage6 → stage7
   Description: Move disk A from on top of D (right peg) onto disk B (now top on middle).
   Precondition satisfied: A is top on D; B is top on middle; A is smaller than B.
   Effect: middle: A on B on C. right: D (now top). left: empty.

8) t=7s → 8s
   Action: (mover-move-peg-to-peg diskd right left)  stage7 → stage8
   Description: Move disk D from the right peg to the empty left peg.
   Precondition satisfied: D is top on right; left peg is empty.
   Effect: left: D (top). right: empty. middle: A on B on C.

9) t=8s → 9s
   Action: (mover-move-disk-to-disk diska diskb diskd)  stage8 → stage9
   Description: Move disk A from on top of B (middle) onto disk D (on left).
   Precondition satisfied: A is top on B; D is top on left; A is smaller than D.
   Effect: left: A on D. middle: B on C (B becomes top). right: empty.

10) t=9s → 10s
    Action: (mover-move-disk-to-peg diskb diskc right)  stage9 → stage10
    Description: Move disk B from on top of C (middle) to the empty right peg.
    Precondition satisfied: B is top on C; right peg is empty.
    Effect: right: B (top). middle: C (now top). left: A on D.

11) t=10s → 11s
    Action: (mover-move-disk-to-disk diska diskd diskb)  stage10 → stage11
    Description: Move disk A from on top of D (left) onto disk B (right).
    Precondition satisfied: A is top on D; B is top on right; A is smaller than B.
    Effect: right: A on B. left: D (now top). middle: C.

12) t=11s → 12s
    Action: (mover-move-peg-to-disk diskc middle diskd)  stage11 → stage12
    Description: Move disk C from the middle peg onto disk D (on the left peg).
    Precondition satisfied: C is top on middle; D is top on left; C is smaller than D.
    Effect: left: C on D (with D below; A remains on B on right). middle: empty. right: A on B.

13) t=12s → 13s
    Action: (mover-move-disk-to-peg diska diskb middle)  stage12 → stage13
    Description: Move disk A from on top of B (right) to the empty middle peg.
    Precondition satisfied: A is top on B; middle peg is empty.
    Effect: middle: A. right: B (now top). left: C on D.

14) t=13s → 14s
    Action: (mover-move-peg-to-disk diskb right diskc)  stage13 → stage14
    Description: Move disk B from the right peg onto disk C (on the left peg).
    Precondition satisfied: B is top on right; C is top on left; B is smaller than C.
    Effect: left: B on C on D (B top above C and D). right: empty. middle: A.

15) t=14s → 15s
    Action: (mover-move-peg-to-disk diska middle diskb)  stage14 → stage15
    Description: Move disk A from the middle peg onto disk B (on the left peg), completing the tower on the left peg.
    Precondition satisfied: A is top on middle; B is top on left; A is smaller than B.
    Effect (final): left: A on B on C on D (top → bottom). middle: empty. right: empty. current stage = stage15.

Final confirmation:
- Goal achieved at t=15s (stage15): left peg contains A (top), B, C, D (bottom) in that order; middle and right pegs are empty. The plan strictly follows the Tower of Hanoi rules (one top disk moved at a time; never placing a larger disk on a smaller disk) and matches the given PDDL plan exactly.
