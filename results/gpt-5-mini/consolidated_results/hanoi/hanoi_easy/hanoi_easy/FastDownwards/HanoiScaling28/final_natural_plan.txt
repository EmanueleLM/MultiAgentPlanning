Timeline of moves (each move takes 1 time unit). Stages map to integer times: stage0 = time 0, stage1 = time 1, ..., stage15 = time 15.

1) Time 0 → 1 (stage0 → stage1): Move disk A from on top of disk B to peg LEFT.
2) Time 1 → 2 (stage1 → stage2): Move disk B from on top of disk C to peg MIDDLE.
3) Time 2 → 3 (stage2 → stage3): Move disk A from peg LEFT onto disk B.
4) Time 3 → 4 (stage3 → stage4): Move disk C from on top of disk D to peg LEFT.
5) Time 4 → 5 (stage4 → stage5): Move disk A from on top of disk B onto disk D.
6) Time 5 → 6 (stage5 → stage6): Move disk B from on top of disk C onto disk C's current top position on peg MIDDLE (i.e., move B onto disk C).
7) Time 6 → 7 (stage6 → stage7): Move disk A from on top of disk D onto disk B.
8) Time 7 → 8 (stage7 → stage8): Move disk D from on top of peg RIGHT to peg MIDDLE.
9) Time 8 → 9 (stage8 → stage9): Move disk A from on top of disk B onto disk D.
10) Time 9 → 10 (stage9 → stage10): Move disk B from on top of disk C to peg RIGHT.
11) Time 10 → 11 (stage10 → stage11): Move disk A from on top of disk D onto disk B.
12) Time 11 → 12 (stage11 → stage12): Move disk C from on top of disk D onto disk D's top on peg LEFT (i.e., move C onto disk D).
13) Time 12 → 13 (stage12 → stage13): Move disk A from on top of disk B to peg LEFT.
14) Time 13 → 14 (stage13 → stage14): Move disk B from peg RIGHT onto disk C.
15) Time 14 → 15 (stage14 → stage15): Move disk A from peg LEFT onto disk B.

Final state at time 15 (stage15): Middle peg holds (top to bottom) A on B on C on D; LEFT and RIGHT pegs are empty. This sequence follows the single-top-disk, one-move-at-a-time, and larger-never-on-smaller constraints.
