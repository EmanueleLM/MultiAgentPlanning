1. Step 1 (s1 → s2, t = 1): Move disk A from right to middle.
2. Step 2 (s2 → s3, t = 2): Move disk B from right to left.
3. Step 3 (s3 → s4, t = 3): Move disk A from middle to left.
4. Step 4 (s4 → s5, t = 4): Move disk C from right to middle.
5. Step 5 (s5 → s6, t = 5): Move disk A from left to right.
6. Step 6 (s6 → s7, t = 6): Move disk B from left to middle.
7. Step 7 (s7 → s8, t = 7): Move disk A from right to middle.
8. Step 8 (s8 → s9, t = 8): Move disk D from right to left.
9. Step 9 (s9 → s10, t = 9): Move disk A from middle to left.
10. Step 10 (s10 → s11, t = 10): Move disk B from middle to right.
11. Step 11 (s11 → s12, t = 11): Move disk A from left to right.
12. Step 12 (s12 → s13, t = 12): Move disk C from middle to left.
13. Step 13 (s13 → s14, t = 13): Move disk A from right to middle.
14. Step 14 (s14 → s15, t = 14): Move disk B from right to left.
15. Step 15 (s15 → s16, t = 15): Move disk A from middle to left.

Total moves: 15 (one move per step). Final state after t = 15: left peg holds, from top to bottom, A, B, C, D; middle and right pegs are empty (tower successfully moved to the left peg).
