Here are the 15 concrete steps from the plan, reported in human-readable form. Each action consumes one stage (timestamp) and thus is shown as sN -> sN+1 (duration = 1 time unit).

1. Step 1 (s0 -> s1, duration 1): Move disk A from on top of disk B to peg middle.
2. Step 2 (s1 -> s2, duration 1): Move disk B from on top of disk C to peg right.
3. Step 3 (s2 -> s3, duration 1): Move disk A from peg middle onto disk B.
4. Step 4 (s3 -> s4, duration 1): Move disk C from on top of disk D to peg middle.
5. Step 5 (s4 -> s5, duration 1): Move disk A from on disk B onto disk D.
6. Step 6 (s5 -> s6, duration 1): Move disk B from peg right onto disk C.
7. Step 7 (s6 -> s7, duration 1): Move disk A from disk D onto disk B.
8. Step 8 (s7 -> s8, duration 1): Move disk D from peg left to peg right.
9. Step 9 (s8 -> s9, duration 1): Move disk A from disk B onto disk D.
10. Step 10 (s9 -> s10, duration 1): Move disk B from disk C to peg left.
11. Step 11 (s10 -> s11, duration 1): Move disk A from disk D onto disk B.
12. Step 12 (s11 -> s12, duration 1): Move disk C from peg middle onto disk D.
13. Step 13 (s12 -> s13, duration 1): Move disk A from disk B to peg middle.
14. Step 14 (s13 -> s14, duration 1): Move disk B from peg left onto disk C.
15. Step 15 (s14 -> s15, duration 1): Move disk A from peg middle onto disk B.

Result after Step 15 (current s15): the tower A (top), B, C, D is on the right peg; left and middle pegs are empty — the specified goal is achieved.
