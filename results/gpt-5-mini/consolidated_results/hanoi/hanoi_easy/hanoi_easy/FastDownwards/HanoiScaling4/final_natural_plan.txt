Plan (15 atomic moves). Each line shows: step number, discrete stage transition, timestamp (1s per move), and a clear move description using disk names A (smallest) → D (largest) and peg names left/middle/right.

1) step0 -> step1, t=0s: move A from on top of disk B -> right peg.  
2) step1 -> step2, t=1s: move B from on top of disk C -> middle peg.  
3) step2 -> step3, t=2s: move A from right peg -> onto disk B (on middle).  
4) step3 -> step4, t=3s: move C from on top of disk D -> right peg.  
5) step4 -> step5, t=4s: move A from on top of disk B -> onto disk D (on right).  
6) step5 -> step6, t=5s: move B from middle peg -> onto disk C.  
7) step6 -> step7, t=6s: move A from on top of disk D -> onto disk B.  
8) step7 -> step8, t=7s: move D from left peg -> middle peg.  
9) step8 -> step9, t=8s: move A from on top of disk B -> onto disk D.  
10) step9 -> step10, t=9s: move B from on top of disk C -> left peg.  
11) step10 -> step11, t=10s: move A from on top of disk D -> onto disk B.  
12) step11 -> step12, t=11s: move C from right peg -> onto disk D.  
13) step12 -> step13, t=12s: move A from on top of disk B -> right peg.  
14) step13 -> step14, t=13s: move B from left peg -> onto disk C.  
15) step14 -> step15, t=14s: move A from right peg -> onto disk B.

(End state at step15: middle peg holds, top-to-bottom, A, B, C, D; left and right pegs are empty.)
