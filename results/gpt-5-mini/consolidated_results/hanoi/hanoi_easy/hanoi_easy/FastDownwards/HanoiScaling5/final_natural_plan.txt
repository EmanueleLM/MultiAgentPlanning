Human-readable action sequence (matches the given PDDL plan exactly). Timestamps are illustrative; each step lists a timestamp and a nominal duration.

1) 00:00:00.000 (duration 0.1s) — Propagate smaller: infer B < D from (B < C) and (C < D).

2) 00:00:00.100 (duration 0.1s) — Propagate smaller: infer A < D from (A < B) and (B < D).

3) 00:00:01.000 (duration 1s) — Move disk A from right (on top of B) to middle (empty).  
   Description: move-disk-to-empty right → middle (A from on-disk B to on-peg middle).

4) 00:00:02.000 (duration 1s) — Move disk B from right (on top of C) to left (empty).  
   Description: move-disk-to-empty right → left (B from on-disk C to on-peg left).

5) 00:00:03.000 (duration 1s) — Move disk A from middle (alone) onto disk B on left.  
   Description: move-peg-to-disk middle → left (A onto B).

6) 00:00:04.000 (duration 1s) — Move disk C from right (on top of D) to middle (empty).  
   Description: move-disk-to-empty right → middle (C from on-disk D to on-peg middle).

7) 00:00:05.000 (duration 1s) — Move disk A from left (on top of B) onto disk D on right.  
   Description: move-disk-to-disk left → right (A from on-disk B onto D).

8) 00:00:06.000 (duration 1s) — Move disk B from left (alone on the peg) onto disk C on middle.  
   Description: move-peg-to-disk left → middle (B onto C).

9) 00:00:07.000 (duration 1s) — Move disk A from right (on top of D) onto disk B on middle.  
   Description: move-disk-to-disk right → middle (A from on-disk D onto B).

10) 00:00:08.000 (duration 1s) — Move disk D from right (alone on the peg) to left (empty).  
    Description: move-peg-to-empty right → left (D moves to empty left peg).

11) 00:00:09.000 (duration 1s) — Move disk A from middle (on top of B) onto disk D on left.  
    Description: move-disk-to-disk middle → left (A from on-disk B onto D).

12) 00:00:10.000 (duration 1s) — Move disk B from middle (on top of C) to right (empty).  
    Description: move-disk-to-empty middle → right (B from on-disk C to on-peg right).

13) 00:00:11.000 (duration 1s) — Move disk A from left (on top of D) onto disk B on right.  
    Description: move-disk-to-disk left → right (A from on-disk D onto B).

14) 00:00:12.000 (duration 1s) — Move disk C from middle (alone on the peg) onto disk D on left.  
    Description: move-peg-to-disk middle → left (C onto D).

15) 00:00:13.000 (duration 1s) — Move disk A from right (on top of B) to middle (empty).  
    Description: move-disk-to-empty right → middle (A from on-disk B to on-peg middle).

16) 00:00:14.000 (duration 1s) — Move disk B from right (alone on the peg) onto disk C on left.  
    Description: move-peg-to-disk right → left (B onto C).

17) 00:00:15.000 (duration 1s) — Move disk A from middle (alone) onto disk B on left.  
    Description: move-peg-to-disk middle → left (A onto B).

End state after step 17: left peg (top-to-bottom) A, B, C, D; middle peg empty; right peg empty — goal achieved.
