Below is a clear, step-by-step human-readable execution of the provided PDDL plan. Each step matches the plan exactly (no additions or deletions). I list the acting operator, the disk moved (with both PDDL name and human label), the source support and destination (peg or disk), the required preconditions immediately before the move, the effects immediately after the move, and a simple timestamp assuming each move takes 1 time unit. The plan advances the stage by one at each move; starting stage0 and finishing stage15 (15 moves total).

Legend: diska = Disk A, diskb = Disk B, diskc = Disk C, diskd = Disk D; pegleft = Left peg, pegmid = Middle peg, pegright = Right peg. Operator = operator1. Time shown as [t -> t+1].

Step 1 — time [0 -> 1]
- Action: operator1 moves diska (Disk A) from diskb (Disk B) to pegmid (Middle peg).
- Preconditions: diska is on diskb; diska is top/clear; pegmid is empty/clear.
- Effects: diska is no longer on diskb and is now on pegmid; diskb becomes clear; pegmid is no longer clear; stage advances stage0 -> stage1.

Step 2 — time [1 -> 2]
- Action: operator1 moves diskb (Disk B) from diskc (Disk C) to pegright (Right peg).
- Preconditions: diskb is on diskc; diskb is top/clear; pegright is empty/clear.
- Effects: diskb is no longer on diskc and is now on pegright; diskc becomes clear; pegright is no longer clear; stage advances stage1 -> stage2.

Step 3 — time [2 -> 3]
- Action: operator1 moves diska (Disk A) from pegmid (Middle peg) onto diskb (Disk B).
- Preconditions: diska is on pegmid; diska is top/clear; diskb is top/clear; diska is smaller than diskb.
- Effects: diska is no longer on pegmid and is now on diskb; pegmid becomes clear; diskb is no longer clear (has diska on it); stage advances stage2 -> stage3.

Step 4 — time [3 -> 4]
- Action: operator1 moves diskc (Disk C) from diskd (Disk D) to pegmid (Middle peg).
- Preconditions: diskc is on diskd; diskc is top/clear; pegmid is empty/clear.
- Effects: diskc is no longer on diskd and is now on pegmid; diskd becomes clear; pegmid is no longer clear; stage advances stage3 -> stage4.

Step 5 — time [4 -> 5]
- Action: operator1 moves diska (Disk A) from diskb (Disk B) onto diskd (Disk D).
- Preconditions: diska is on diskb; diska is top/clear; diskd is top/clear; diska is smaller than diskd.
- Effects: diska is no longer on diskb and is now on diskd; diskb becomes clear; diskd is no longer clear; stage advances stage4 -> stage5.

Step 6 — time [5 -> 6]
- Action: operator1 moves diskb (Disk B) from pegright (Right peg) onto diskc (Disk C).
- Preconditions: diskb is on pegright; diskb is top/clear; diskc is top/clear; diskb is smaller than diskc.
- Effects: diskb is no longer on pegright and is now on diskc; pegright becomes clear; diskc is no longer clear; stage advances stage5 -> stage6.

Step 7 — time [6 -> 7]
- Action: operator1 moves diska (Disk A) from diskd (Disk D) onto diskb (Disk B).
- Preconditions: diska is on diskd; diska is top/clear; diskb is top/clear; diska is smaller than diskb.
- Effects: diska is no longer on diskd and is now on diskb; diskd becomes clear; diskb is no longer clear; stage advances stage6 -> stage7.

Step 8 — time [7 -> 8]
- Action: operator1 moves diskd (Disk D) from pegleft (Left peg) to pegright (Right peg).
- Preconditions: diskd is on pegleft; diskd is top/clear; pegright is empty/clear.
- Effects: diskd is no longer on pegleft and is now on pegright; pegleft becomes clear; pegright is no longer clear; stage advances stage7 -> stage8.

Step 9 — time [8 -> 9]
- Action: operator1 moves diska (Disk A) from diskb (Disk B) onto diskd (Disk D).
- Preconditions: diska is on diskb; diska is top/clear; diskd is top/clear; diska is smaller than diskd.
- Effects: diska is no longer on diskb and is now on diskd; diskb becomes clear; diskd is no longer clear; stage advances stage8 -> stage9.

Step 10 — time [9 -> 10]
- Action: operator1 moves diskb (Disk B) from diskc (Disk C) to pegleft (Left peg).
- Preconditions: diskb is on diskc; diskb is top/clear; pegleft is empty/clear.
- Effects: diskb is no longer on diskc and is now on pegleft; diskc becomes clear; pegleft is no longer clear; stage advances stage9 -> stage10.

Step 11 — time [10 -> 11]
- Action: operator1 moves diska (Disk A) from diskd (Disk D) onto diskb (Disk B).
- Preconditions: diska is on diskd; diska is top/clear; diskb is top/clear; diska is smaller than diskb.
- Effects: diska is no longer on diskd and is now on diskb; diskd becomes clear; diskb is no longer clear; stage advances stage10 -> stage11.

Step 12 — time [11 -> 12]
- Action: operator1 moves diskc (Disk C) from pegmid (Middle peg) onto diskd (Disk D).
- Preconditions: diskc is on pegmid; diskc is top/clear; diskd is top/clear; diskc is smaller than diskd.
- Effects: diskc is no longer on pegmid and is now on diskd; pegmid becomes clear; diskd is no longer clear; stage advances stage11 -> stage12.

Step 13 — time [12 -> 13]
- Action: operator1 moves diska (Disk A) from diskb (Disk B) to pegmid (Middle peg).
- Preconditions: diska is on diskb; diska is top/clear; pegmid is empty/clear.
- Effects: diska is no longer on diskb and is now on pegmid; diskb becomes clear; pegmid is no longer clear; stage advances stage12 -> stage13.

Step 14 — time [13 -> 14]
- Action: operator1 moves diskb (Disk B) from pegleft (Left peg) onto diskc (Disk C).
- Preconditions: diskb is on pegleft; diskb is top/clear; diskc is top/clear; diskb is smaller than diskc.
- Effects: diskb is no longer on pegleft and is now on diskc; pegleft becomes clear; diskc is no longer clear; stage advances stage13 -> stage14.

Step 15 — time [14 -> 15]
- Action: operator1 moves diska (Disk A) from pegmid (Middle peg) onto diskb (Disk B).
- Preconditions: diska is on pegmid; diska is top/clear; diskb is top/clear; diska is smaller than diskb.
- Effects: diska is no longer on pegmid and is now on diskb; pegmid becomes clear; diskb is no longer clear; stage advances stage14 -> stage15.

Final state after time 15:
- Stack on pegright (top -> bottom): diska (A) on diskb (B) on diskc (C) on diskd (D).
- clear diska (top clear).
- pegleft and pegmid are empty (clear).
- current stage = stage15.
- Total moves (cost): 15.

This sequence is exactly the provided PDDL plan, annotated with the explicit preconditions and effects required/produced by each action and with a simple per-move timestamp (1 time unit per move).
