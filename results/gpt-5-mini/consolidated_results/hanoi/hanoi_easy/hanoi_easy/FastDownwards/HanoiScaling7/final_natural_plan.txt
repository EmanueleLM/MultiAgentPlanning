Below is a human-readable, step-by-step rendering of the provided PDDL plan. Each step corresponds exactly to one action in the plan, lists the step timestamps (s0→s1 etc.), gives the primitive move in plain language, and verifies the key preconditions (moved disk was top; size rule / target emptiness respected). I also show the peg contents after each move (top-to-bottom).

Step 1  [s0 → s1, duration 1]
Action (plan): (move-disk-to-peg a b left s0 s1)
Move: Take disk A (top of the middle stack, on disk B) and move it to the left peg (empty).
Preconditions satisfied: A was top; left peg empty.
Resulting configuration:
- Left: A
- Middle: B, C, D (top-to-bottom B,C,D)
- Right: (empty)

Step 2  [s1 → s2, duration 1]
Action (plan): (move-disk-to-peg b c right s1 s2)
Move: Take disk B (now top of the middle stack, on disk C) and move it to the right peg (empty).
Preconditions satisfied: B was top; right peg empty.
Resulting configuration:
- Left: A
- Middle: C, D (top-to-bottom C,D)
- Right: B

Step 3  [s2 → s3, duration 1]
Action (plan): (move-peg-to-disk a left b s2 s3)

Step 5  [s4 → s5, duration 1]
Action (plan): (move-disk-to-disk a b d s4 s5)
Move: Take disk A (top of right, currently on B) and place it onto disk D (on the middle peg).

Step 6  [s5 → s6, duration 1]
Action (plan): (move-peg-to-disk b right c s5 s6)
Move: Take disk B (top of right peg) and place it onto disk C (on the left peg).
Preconditions satisfied: B was top on right; C was top on left; B is smaller than C.
Resulting configuration:
- Left: B, C (top-to-bottom B,C)
- Middle: A, D
- Right: (empty)

Step 7  [s6 → s7, duration 1]
Action (plan): (move-disk-to-disk a d b s6 s7)
Move: Take disk A (top of middle, on D) and place it onto disk B (on the left peg).
Preconditions satisfied: A was top on D; B was top on left; A is smaller than B.
Resulting configuration:
- Left: A, B, C (top-to-bottom A,B,C)
- Middle: D
- Right: (empty)

Step 8  [s7 → s8, duration 1]
Action (plan): (move-peg-to-peg d middle right s7 s8)
Move: Take disk D (top of the middle peg) and move it to the right peg (empty).
Preconditions satisfied: D was top on middle; right peg empty.
Resulting configuration:
- Left: A, B, C
- Middle: (empty)
- Right: D

Step 9  [s8 → s9, duration 1]
Action (plan): (move-disk-to-disk a b d s8 s9)
Move: Take disk A (top of left, on B) and place it onto disk D (on the right peg).
Preconditions satisfied: A was top on B; D was top on right; A is smaller than D.
Resulting configuration:
- Left: B, C (top-to-bottom B,C)
- Middle: (empty)
- Right: A, D (top-to-bottom A,D)

Step 10  [s9 → s10, duration 1]
Action (plan): (move-disk-to-peg b c middle s9 s10)
Move: Take disk B (top of left, on C) and move it to the middle peg (empty).
Preconditions satisfied: B was top on left; middle peg empty.
Resulting configuration:
- Left: C
- Middle: B
- Right: A, D

Step 11  [s10 → s11, duration 1]
Action (plan): (move-disk-to-disk a d b s10 s11)
Move: Take disk A (top of right, on D) and place it onto disk B (middle).
Preconditions satisfied: A was top on D; B was top on middle; A is smaller than B.
Resulting configuration:
- Left: C
- Middle: A, B (top-to-bottom A,B)
- Right: D

Step 12  [s11 → s12, duration 1]
Action (plan): (move-peg-to-disk c left d s11 s12)
Move: Take disk C (top of left peg) and place it onto disk D (on the right peg).
Preconditions satisfied: C was top on left; D was top on right; C is smaller than D.
Resulting configuration:
- Left: (empty)
- Middle: A, B
- Right: C, D (top-to-bottom C,D)

Step 13  [s12 → s13, duration 1]
Action (plan): (move-disk-to-peg a b left s12 s13)
Move: Take disk A (top of middle, on B) and move it to the left peg (empty).
Preconditions satisfied: A was top on middle; left peg empty.
Resulting configuration:
- Left: A
- Middle: B
- Right: C, D

Step 14  [s13 → s14, duration 1]
Action (plan): (move-peg-to-disk b middle c s13 s14)
Move: Take disk B (top of the middle peg) and place it onto disk C (on the right peg).
Preconditions satisfied: B was top on middle; C was top on right; B is smaller than C.
Resulting configuration:
- Left: A
- Middle: (empty)
- Right: B, C, D (top-to-bottom B,C,D)

Step 15  [s14 → s15, duration 1]
Action (plan): (move-peg-to-disk a left b s14 s15)
Move: Take disk A (top of left peg) and place it onto disk B (on the right peg).
Preconditions satisfied: A was top on left; B was top on right; A is smaller than B.
Resulting configuration (goal state):
- Left: (empty)
- Middle: (empty)
- Right: A, B, C, D (top-to-bottom A,B,C,D)
- current-step: s15 (final step reached)

Final verification
- All 15 moves are exactly those in the given plan, executed in order (s0→s15).
- The Tower-of-Hanoi rules were respected at each step: only top disks moved, one disk per move, and a disk was never placed on a smaller disk.
- The final goal is satisfied: right peg holds A,B,C,D (top-to-bottom), left and middle pegs are empty, and current-step is s15 (enforcing exactly 15 moves).
