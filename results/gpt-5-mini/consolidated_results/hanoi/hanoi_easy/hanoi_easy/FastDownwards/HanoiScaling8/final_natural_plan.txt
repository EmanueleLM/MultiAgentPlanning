1. Step 1 (t0 → t1) — move-disk-to-peg a b left  
   Move disk A from on top of disk B to peg left.

2. Step 2 (t1 → t2) — move-disk-to-peg b c right  
   Move disk B from on top of disk C to peg right.

3. Step 3 (t2 → t3) — move-peg-to-disk a left b  
   Move disk A from peg left onto disk B.

4. Step 4 (t3 → t4) — move-disk-to-peg c d left  
   Move disk C from on top of disk D to peg left.

5. Step 5 (t4 → t5) — move-disk-to-disk a b d  
   Move disk A from on top of disk B onto disk D.

6. Step 6 (t5 → t6) — move-peg-to-disk b right c  
   Move disk B from peg right onto disk C.

7. Step 7 (t6 → t7) — move-disk-to-disk a d b  
   Move disk A from on top of disk D onto disk B.

8. Step 8 (t7 → t8) — move-peg-to-peg d middle right  
   Move disk D from peg middle to peg right.

9. Step 9 (t8 → t9) — move-disk-to-disk a b d  
   Move disk A from on top of disk B onto disk D.

10. Step 10 (t9 → t10) — move-disk-to-peg b c middle  
    Move disk B from on top of disk C to peg middle.

11. Step 11 (t10 → t11) — move-disk-to-disk a d b  
    Move disk A from on top of disk D onto disk B.

12. Step 12 (t11 → t12) — move-peg-to-disk c left d  
    Move disk C from peg left onto disk D.

13. Step 13 (t12 → t13) — move-disk-to-peg a b left  
    Move disk A from on top of disk B to peg left.

14. Step 14 (t13 → t14) — move-peg-to-disk b middle c  
    Move disk B from peg middle onto disk C.

15. Step 15 (t14 → t15) — move-peg-to-disk a left b  
    Move disk A from peg left onto disk B.

Final state (after t15): right peg stack is (bottom → top) D, C, B, A; left and middle pegs are empty; current time is t15. All moves respect the rules (one top disk moved at a time; never place a larger disk onto a smaller disk).
