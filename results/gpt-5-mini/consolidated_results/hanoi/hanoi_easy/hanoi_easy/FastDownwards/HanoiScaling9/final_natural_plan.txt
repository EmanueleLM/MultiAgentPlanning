Below is a human-readable, step-by-step execution of the provided plan. Each step shows the stage timestamp (stageX -> stageY) and a duration of 1 stage (one time-step). The wording specifies which disk moves, where it starts (including whether it was on another disk or directly on a peg), and where it is placed (onto an empty peg or onto a disk).

1. Step 1 — stage0 -> stage1 (duration: 1 stage)
   - Move disk A (top disk on middle, directly on disk B) from middle to the empty peg left.
   - Action: (move-from-disk-to-empty A on B, middle → left)

2. Step 2 — stage1 -> stage2 (duration: 1 stage)
   - Move disk B (now top on middle, directly on disk C) from middle to the empty peg right.
   - Action: (move-from-disk-to-empty B on C, middle → right)

3. Step 3 — stage2 -> stage3 (duration: 1 stage)
   - Move disk A (top on peg left, i.e., on-peg A on left) from left onto disk B on the right peg.
   - Action: (move-from-peg-to-disk A left → right onto B)

4. Step 4 — stage3 -> stage4 (duration: 1 stage)
   - Move disk C (top on middle, directly on disk D) from middle to the empty peg left.
   - Action: (move-from-disk-to-empty C on D, middle → left)

5. Step 5 — stage4 -> stage5 (duration: 1 stage)
   - Move disk A (top on right, directly on disk B) from right onto disk D on the middle peg.
   - Action: (move-from-disk-to-disk A on B, right → middle onto D)

6. Step 6 — stage5 -> stage6 (duration: 1 stage)
   - Move disk B (top on right) from right onto disk C on the left peg.
   - Action: (move-from-peg-to-disk B right → left onto C)

7. Step 7 — stage6 -> stage7 (duration: 1 stage)
   - Move disk A (top on middle, directly on disk D) from middle onto disk B on the left peg.
   - Action: (move-from-disk-to-disk A on D, middle → left onto B)

8. Step 8 — stage7 -> stage8 (duration: 1 stage)
   - Move disk D (top on middle, directly on the peg middle) from middle to the empty peg right.
   - Action: (move-from-peg-to-empty D middle → right)

9. Step 9 — stage8 -> stage9 (duration: 1 stage)
   - Move disk A (top on left, directly on disk B) from left onto disk D on the right peg.
   - Action: (move-from-disk-to-disk A on B, left → right onto D)

10. Step 10 — stage9 -> stage10 (duration: 1 stage)
    - Move disk B (top on left, directly on disk C) from left to the now-empty peg middle.
    - Action: (move-from-disk-to-empty B on C, left → middle)

11. Step 11 — stage10 -> stage11 (duration: 1 stage)
    - Move disk A (top on right, directly on disk D) from right onto disk B on the middle peg.
    - Action: (move-from-disk-to-disk A on D, right → middle onto B)

12. Step 12 — stage11 -> stage12 (duration: 1 stage)
    - Move disk C (top on left) from left onto disk D on the right peg.
    - Action: (move-from-peg-to-disk C left → right onto D)

13. Step 13 — stage12 -> stage13 (duration: 1 stage)
    - Move disk A (top on middle, directly on disk B) from middle to the empty peg left.
    - Action: (move-from-disk-to-empty A on B, middle → left)

14. Step 14 — stage13 -> stage14 (duration: 1 stage)
    - Move disk B (top on middle) from middle onto disk C on the right peg.
    - Action: (move-from-peg-to-disk B middle → right onto C)

15. Step 15 — stage14 -> stage15 (duration: 1 stage)
    - Move disk A (top on left) from left onto disk B on the right peg.
    - Action: (move-from-peg-to-disk A left → right onto B)

Final state after stage15 (goal achieved):
- Right peg (top to bottom): A, B, C, D
- Left peg: empty
- Middle peg: empty
- Current stage: stage15

This sequence exactly follows the provided plan (15 unit moves) and reaches the specified goal.
