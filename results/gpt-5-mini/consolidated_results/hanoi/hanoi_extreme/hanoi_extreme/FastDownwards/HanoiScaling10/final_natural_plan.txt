Final state (after step127):
- Current step is step127.
- The plan as executed achieves the intended goal ordering on peg p_right: top-to-bottom disks A, B, C, D, E, F, G (the plan was constructed to reach that final stack).
- Peg p_left and peg p_middle are left empty in the goal configuration.

Notes:
- Each listed move corresponds exactly to the action entries in the provided plan; no actions were added or removed.
- Each move corresponds to a single atomic time step in the plan (stepN -> stepN+1), consistent with the domain's step/successor encoding.
