PROBLEM
------------------------------
I am practicing the Tower of Hanoi puzzle. Here is the action I can do

Move the top disk from one peg to another peg

I must obey the following rules:
I can move only one disk at a time.
I may only move a disk that is on top of a peg.
I can never place a larger disk on top of a smaller disk.
Once a disk is moved, it keeps its relative size ordering with the others.

[STATEMENT]
There are 7 disks in total. From smallest to largest they are disk A, disk B, disk C, disk D, disk E, disk F, and disk G.
As initial conditions I have that, the middle peg holds, from top to bottom, disk A, disk B, disk C, disk D, disk E, disk F, and disk G, while the left peg and the right peg are empty.
My goal is to have that the right peg holds, from top to bottom, disk A, disk B, disk C, disk D, disk E, disk F, and disk G, and both the middle peg and the left peg are empty again.
The left peg can be used as an intermediate parking spot but must end up empty.

My plan is as follows:

Below is the exact sequence of moves from the provided plan, rendered in human-readable form. Each step shows the move, the source (either "peg X" or "on diskY"), the destination (either "peg X" or "onto diskY"), and the timestamp (Tn -> Tn+1). Each move advances time by one unit (duration = 1).

1. T0 -> T1: move diskA from on diskB to peg right. (duration 1)
2. T1 -> T2: move diskB from on diskC to peg left. (duration 1)
3. T2 -> T3: move diskA from peg right onto diskB. (duration 1)
4. T3 -> T4: move diskC from on diskD to peg right. (duration 1)
5. T4 -> T5: move diskA from on diskB onto diskD. (duration 1)
6. T5 -> T6: move diskB from on diskC to peg left. (duration 1)
7. T6 -> T7: move diskA from on diskD onto diskB. (duration 1)
8. T7 -> T8: move diskD from on diskE to peg left. (duration 1)
9. T8 -> T9: move diskA from on diskB onto diskD. (duration 1)
10. T9 -> T10: move diskB from on diskC onto diskE. (duration 1)

PROBLEM
------------------------------
I am practicing the Tower of Hanoi puzzle. Here is the action I can do

Move the top disk from one peg to another peg

I must obey the following rules:
I can move only one disk at a time.
I may only move a disk that is on top of a peg.
I can never place a larger disk on top of a smaller disk.
Once a disk is moved, it keeps its relative size ordering with the others.

[STATEMENT]
There are 7 disks in total. From smallest to largest they are disk A, disk B, disk C, disk D, disk E, disk F, and disk G.
As initial conditions I have that, the right peg holds, from top to bottom, disk A, disk B, disk C, disk D, disk E, disk F, and disk G, while the middle peg and the left peg are empty.
My goal is to have that the left peg holds, from top to bottom, disk A, disk B, disk C, disk D, disk E, disk F, and disk G, and both the right peg and the middle peg are empty again.
The middle peg can be used as an intermediate parking spot but must end up empty.

My plan is as follows:
