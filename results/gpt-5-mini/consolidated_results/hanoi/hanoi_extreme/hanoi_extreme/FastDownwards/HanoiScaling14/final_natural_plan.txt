Below is a human-readable, step-by-step transcription of the provided plan. Each step exactly matches one action in the plan (no actions added or removed). For each move I list: step number, the move (which disk is moved, from which support to which support), and the plan stage transition used as a timestamp (sX -> sY). Each action corresponds to one unit of cost/time.
