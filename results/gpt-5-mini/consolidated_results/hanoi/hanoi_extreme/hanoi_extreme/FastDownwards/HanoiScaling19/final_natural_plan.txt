Mapping used: d1 = smallest disk (A), d2 = B, d3 = C, d4 = D, d5 = E, d6 = F, d7 = largest disk (G).
Timestamps: each listed step is one atomic move. I show a simple timeline assuming each move takes 1.0 s; Step N is executed from t=(N-1) s to t=N s.

(End of plan: total cost = 151 moves / 151.0 s in this timeline.)

Notes:
- Each step corresponds exactly to the action in the supplied plan; no moves were added or removed.
- Each move statement shows: disk identifier, its human-size mapping (A–G), the support it moved from (peg or disk) and the support it moved to (peg or disk).
- The sequence respects the Tower of Hanoi rules: only top disks are moved and a disk is always placed either on an empty peg or on a strictly larger disk.
