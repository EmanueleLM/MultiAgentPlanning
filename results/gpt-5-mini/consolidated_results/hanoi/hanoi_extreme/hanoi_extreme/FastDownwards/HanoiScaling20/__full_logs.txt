PROBLEM
------------------------------
I am practicing the Tower of Hanoi puzzle. Here is the action I can do

Move the top disk from one peg to another peg

I must obey the following rules:
I can move only one disk at a time.
I may only move a disk that is on top of a peg.
I can never place a larger disk on top of a smaller disk.
Once a disk is moved, it keeps its relative size ordering with the others.

[STATEMENT]
There are 7 disks in total. From smallest to largest they are disk A, disk B, disk C, disk D, disk E, disk F, and disk G.
As initial conditions I have that, the right peg holds, from top to bottom, disk A, disk B, disk C, disk D, disk E, disk F, and disk G, while the left peg and the middle peg are empty.
My goal is to have that the middle peg holds, from top to bottom, disk A, disk B, disk C, disk D, disk E, disk F, and disk G, and both the right peg and the left peg are empty again.
The left peg can be used as an intermediate parking spot but must end up empty.

I will not ask the user for further clarifications and I will report the plan that explicitly states all the (2^7 - 1) intermediate steps to achieve the objective in an optimal way. My plan is as follows:

  ;; Mover actions: concrete actions for each combination of source slot and target slot.
  ;; We provide a fully expanded set of move templates; each is guarded to ensure:
  ;; - the moved disk is present at the stated source slot,
  ;; - all slots above the source slot on that peg are empty (so the disk is the top disk on its peg),
  ;; - the target slot is the immediate top slot on the target peg (so the disk ends up on top),
  ;; - if placing onto an existing disk (target slot > 1) the disk below is larger than the moving disk,
  ;; - the step is the current ready step, the step has not yet had a move (step-unmoved),
  ;; - the observer has already reported the initial state (observed-initial).
  ;;
  ;; There are 7 source-slot x 7 target-slot templates; each template is generic in pegs and disks.
  ;; Each template name encodes the numeric slots moved-from and moved-to.
  ;; For space and clarity we enumerate them explicitly.

  ;; Helper note: slot names are slot1 (bottom) .. slot7 (top).
  ;; Precondition patterns below reference specific slot constants and explicit "not (occupied ...)" checks
  ;; to enforce "topness" constraints without arithmetic operations.
