Below is a human-readable, step-by-step recounting of the provided FastDownwards plan. Each step exactly matches one action in the plan (no moves added or removed). For each step I list:
- the step number and timestamp (sX → sY),
- the disk moved,
- the origin peg (left / middle / right),
- the destination peg (left / middle / right),
- a compact peg contents snapshot after the move (top → bottom).

Conventions:
- Disks: A (smallest) ... G (largest).
- Peg names: left, middle, right.
- Peg contents are shown top → bottom; an empty peg is shown as (empty).

End: final state reached at timestamp s127 — all disks A→G stacked on the right peg (top → bottom), left and middle pegs empty, matching the specified goal.

If you want, I can also:
- present this same sequence as a numbered list without the timestamp labels, or
- produce a compact table or CSV of step, disk, origin peg, destination peg, and peg contents for easier machine reading.
