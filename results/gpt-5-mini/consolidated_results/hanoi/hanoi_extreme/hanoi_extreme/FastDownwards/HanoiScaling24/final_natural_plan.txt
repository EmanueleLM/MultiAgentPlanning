Below is a step-by-step, human-readable trace of the provided PDDL plan. Each step corresponds exactly to one action in the plan, in order, and includes the stage transition (sX → sY) from the plan as a timestamp. Each move is instantaneous in the STRIPS model; the plan cost shows each action has unit cost, so I list a duration of 1 unit for each step.
