Below is a human-readable, step-by-step translation of the provided PDDL plan. Each entry shows: (1) the original plan action, (2) a plain-English move description with disk name (mapping plan letters a..g → disks A..G), (3) the plan timestamp transition (sX → sY), (4) a concise legality justification, and (5) a uniform duration of "1 time unit" (each plan step advances the step counter by one).

Legend: a→A, b→B, c→C, d→D, e→E, f→F, g→G.

Final state after step s127: all disks A (top), B, C, D, E, F, G (bottom) are stacked on the middle peg in correct order; left and right pegs are empty; the plan consumes 127 unit steps (s0 → s127) as shown.

Notes:
- Each step exactly corresponds to a plan action in the provided PDDL plan (no actions were added or removed).
- Each action is described with its plan timestamp transition (sX → sY) to show the temporal ordering.
- Each justification is the minimal legality check required by the Tower of Hanoi rules: mover must be top of source, and either target is empty or target's top disk is larger than the moving disk.
