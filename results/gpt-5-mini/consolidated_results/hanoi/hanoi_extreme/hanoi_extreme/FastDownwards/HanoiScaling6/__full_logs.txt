PROBLEM
------------------------------
I am practicing the Tower of Hanoi puzzle. Here is the action I can do

Move the top disk from one peg to another peg

I must obey the following rules:
I can move only one disk at a time.
I may only move a disk that is on top of a peg.
I can never place a larger disk on top of a smaller disk.
Once a disk is moved, it keeps its relative size ordering with the others.

[STATEMENT]
There are 7 disks in total. From smallest to largest they are disk A, disk B, disk C, disk D, disk E, disk F, and disk G.
As initial conditions I have that, the middle peg holds, from top to bottom, disk A, disk B, disk C, disk D, disk E, disk F, and disk G, while the left peg and the right peg are empty.
My goal is to have that the right peg holds, from top to bottom, disk A, disk B, disk C, disk D, disk E, disk F, and disk G, and both the middle peg and the left peg are empty again.
The left peg can be used as an intermediate parking spot but must end up empty.

My plan is as follows:

PROBLEM
------------------------------
I am practicing the Tower of Hanoi puzzle. Here is the action I can do

Move the top disk from one peg to another peg

I must obey the following rules:
I can move only one disk at a time.
I may only move a disk that is on top of a peg.
I can never place a larger disk on top of a smaller disk.
Once a disk is moved, it keeps its relative size ordering with the others.

[STATEMENT]
There are 7 disks in total. From smallest to largest they are disk A, disk B, disk C, disk D, disk E, disk F, and disk G.
As initial conditions I have that, the right peg holds, from top to bottom, disk A, disk B, disk C, disk D, disk E, disk F, and disk G, while the middle peg and the left peg are empty.
My goal is to have that the left peg holds, from top to bottom, disk A, disk B, disk C, disk D, disk E, disk F, and disk G, and both the right peg and the middle peg are empty again.
The middle peg can be used as an intermediate parking spot but must end up empty.

My plan is as follows:

PROBLEM
------------------------------
I am practicing the Tower of Hanoi puzzle. Here is the action I can do

Move the top disk from one peg to another peg

I must obey the following rules:
I can move only one disk at a time.
I may only move a disk that is on top of a peg.
I can never place a larger disk on top of a smaller disk.
Once a disk is moved, it keeps its relative size ordering with the others.

[STATEMENT]
There are 7 disks in total. From smallest to largest they are disk A, disk B, disk C, disk D, disk E, disk F, and disk G.
As initial conditions I have that, the left peg holds, from top to bottom, disk A, disk B, disk C, disk D, disk E, disk F, and disk G, while the middle peg and the right peg are empty.
My goal is to have that the right peg holds, from top to bottom, disk A, disk B, disk C, disk D, disk E, disk F, and disk G, and both the left peg and the middle peg are empty again.
The middle peg can be used as an intermediate parking spot but must end up empty.

My plan is as follows:

;   move-to-disk: move a top disk onto an empty disk that is larger than the moving disk.
; - Preconditions enforce that only the top (clear) disk can be moved and the destination must be clear.

From smallest to largest they are disk A, disk B, disk C, disk D, disk E, disk F, and disk G.\nAs initial conditions I have that, the left peg holds, from top to bottom, disk A, disk B, disk C, disk D, disk E, disk F, and disk G, while the middle peg and the right peg are empty.\nMy goal is to have that the right peg holds, from top to bottom, disk A, disk B, disk C, disk D, disk E, disk F, and disk G, and both the left peg and the middle peg are empty again.\nThe middle peg can be used as an intermediate parking spot but must end up empty.\n\nMy plan is as follows:\n\n[PLAN]",

NATURAL-PLAN sas_plan_10
------------------------------
Overview: the following lists the 127 moves in the provided plan in human-readable form. Each entry shows the discrete step transition (sN -> sN+1) and a unit duration (one step) for that move. Disk names shown in uppercase (A..G), pegs in uppercase (LEFT, MIDDLE, RIGHT). Each line exactly corresponds to the PDDL plan actions in order.

1. Step 1 (s0 -> s1, duration 1): Move disk A from disk B to peg RIGHT.
2. Step 2 (s1 -> s2, duration 1): Move disk B from disk C to peg MIDDLE.
3. Step 3 (s2 -> s3, duration 1): Move disk A from peg RIGHT to disk B.
4. Step 4 (s3 -> s4, duration 1): Move disk C from disk D to peg RIGHT.
5. Step 5 (s4 -> s5, duration 1): Move disk A from disk B to disk D.
6. Step 6 (s5 -> s6, duration 1): Move disk B from peg MIDDLE to disk C.

10. Step 10 (s9 -> s10, duration 1): Move disk B from disk C to disk E.
11. Step 11 (s10 -> s11, duration 1): Move disk A from disk D to disk B.
12. Step 12 (s11 -> s12, duration 1): Move disk C from peg RIGHT to disk D.
13. Step 13 (s12 -> s13, duration 1): Move disk A from disk B to peg RIGHT.
14. Step 14 (s13 -> s14, duration 1): Move disk B from disk E to disk C.
15. Step 15 (s14 -> s15, duration 1): Move disk A from peg RIGHT to disk B.
16. Step 16 (s15 -> s16, duration 1): Move disk E from disk F to peg RIGHT.
17. Step 17 (s16 -> s17, duration 1): Move disk A from disk B to disk F.
18. Step 18 (s17 -> s18, duration 1): Move disk B from disk C to disk E.
19. Step 19 (s18 -> s19, duration 1): Move disk A from disk F to disk B.
20. Step 20 (s19 -> s20, duration 1): Move disk C from disk D to disk F.
21. Step 21 (s20 -> s21, duration 1): Move disk A from disk B to disk D.
22. Step 22 (s21 -> s22, duration 1): Move disk B from disk E to disk C.

PROBLEM
------------------------------
I am practicing the Tower of Hanoi puzzle. Here is the action I can do

Move the top disk from one peg to another peg

I must obey the following rules:
I can move only one disk at a time.
I may only move a disk that is on top of a peg.
I can never place a larger disk on top of a smaller disk.
Once a disk is moved, it keeps its relative size ordering with the others.

[STATEMENT]
There are 7 disks in total. From smallest to largest they are disk A, disk B, disk C, disk D, disk E, disk F, and disk G.
As initial conditions I have that, the left peg holds, from top to bottom, disk A, disk B, disk C, disk D, disk E, disk F, and disk G, while the middle peg and the right peg are empty.
My goal is to have that the right peg holds, from top to bottom, disk A, disk B, disk C, disk D, disk E, disk F, and disk G, and both the left peg and the middle peg are empty again.
The middle peg can be used as an intermediate parking spot but must end up empty.

My plan is as follows:

From smallest to largest they are disk A, disk B, disk C, disk D, disk E, disk F, and disk G.\nAs initial conditions I have that, the left peg holds, from top to bottom, disk A, disk B, disk C, disk D, disk E, disk F, and disk G, while the middle peg and the right peg are empty.\nMy goal is to have that the right peg holds, from top to bottom, disk A, disk B, disk C, disk D, disk E, disk F, and disk G, and both the left peg and the middle peg are empty again.\nThe middle peg can be used as an intermediate parking spot but must end up empty.\n\nMy plan is as follows:\n\n[PLAN]",

From smallest to largest they are disk A, disk B, disk C, disk D, disk E, disk F, and disk G.\nAs initial conditions I have that, the left peg holds, from top to bottom, disk A, disk B, disk C, disk D, disk E, disk F, and disk G, while the middle peg and the right peg are empty.\nMy goal is to have that the right peg holds, from top to bottom, disk A, disk B, disk C, disk D, disk E, disk F, and disk G, and both the left peg and the middle peg are empty again.\nThe middle peg can be used as an intermediate parking spot but must end up empty.\n\nMy plan is as follows:\n\n[PLAN]",

PROBLEM
------------------------------
I am practicing the Tower of Hanoi puzzle. Here is the action I can do

Move the top disk from one peg to another peg

I must obey the following rules:
I can move only one disk at a time.
I may only move a disk that is on top of a peg.
I can never place a larger disk on top of a smaller disk.
Once a disk is moved, it keeps its relative size ordering with the others.

[STATEMENT]
There are 7 disks in total. From smallest to largest they are disk A, disk B, disk C, disk D, disk E, disk F, and disk G.
As initial conditions I have that, the left peg holds, from top to bottom, disk A, disk B, disk C, disk D, disk E, disk F, and disk G, while the right peg and the middle peg are empty.
My goal is to have that the middle peg holds, from top to bottom, disk A, disk B, disk C, disk D, disk E, disk F, and disk G, and both the left peg and the right peg are empty again.
The right peg can be used as an intermediate parking spot but must end up empty.

My plan is as follows:

Final state after step s127: all disks A (top), B, C, D, E, F, G (bottom) are stacked on the middle peg in correct order; left and right pegs are empty; the plan consumes 127 unit steps (s0 → s127) as shown.

Notes:
- Each step exactly corresponds to a plan action in the provided PDDL plan (no actions were added or removed).
- Each action is described with its plan timestamp transition (sX → sY) to show the temporal ordering.
- Each justification is the minimal legality check required by the Tower of Hanoi rules: mover must be top of source, and either target is empty or target's top disk is larger than the moving disk.

PROBLEM
------------------------------
I am practicing the Tower of Hanoi puzzle. Here is the action I can do

Move the top disk from one peg to another peg

I must obey the following rules:
I can move only one disk at a time.
I may only move a disk that is on top of a peg.
I can never place a larger disk on top of a smaller disk.
Once a disk is moved, it keeps its relative size ordering with the others.

[STATEMENT]
There are 7 disks in total. From smallest to largest they are disk A, disk B, disk C, disk D, disk E, disk F, and disk G.
As initial conditions I have that, the right peg holds, from top to bottom, disk A, disk B, disk C, disk D, disk E, disk F, and disk G, while the middle peg and the left peg are empty.
My goal is to have that the left peg holds, from top to bottom, disk A, disk B, disk C, disk D, disk E, disk F, and disk G, and both the right peg and the middle peg are empty again.
The middle peg can be used as an intermediate parking spot but must end up empty.

My plan is as follows:

PROBLEM
------------------------------
I am practicing the Tower of Hanoi puzzle. Here is the action I can do

Move the top disk from one peg to another peg

I must obey the following rules:
I can move only one disk at a time.
I may only move a disk that is on top of a peg.
I can never place a larger disk on top of a smaller disk.
Once a disk is moved, it keeps its relative size ordering with the others.

[STATEMENT]
There are 7 disks in total. From smallest to largest they are disk A, disk B, disk C, disk D, disk E, disk F, and disk G.
As initial conditions I have that, the left peg holds, from top to bottom, disk A, disk B, disk C, disk D, disk E, disk F, and disk G, while the middle peg and the right peg are empty.
My goal is to have that the right peg holds, from top to bottom, disk A, disk B, disk C, disk D, disk E, disk F, and disk G, and both the left peg and the middle peg are empty again.
The middle peg can be used as an intermediate parking spot but must end up empty.

My plan is as follows:

From smallest to largest they are disk A, disk B, disk C, disk D, disk E, disk F, and disk G.\nAs initial conditions I have that, the left peg holds, from top to bottom, disk A, disk B, disk C, disk D, disk E, disk F, and disk G, while the middle peg and the right peg are empty.\nMy goal is to have that the right peg holds, from top to bottom, disk A, disk B, disk C, disk D, disk E, disk F, and disk G, and both the left peg and the middle peg are empty again.\nThe middle peg can be used as an intermediate parking spot but must end up empty.\n\nMy plan is as follows:\n\n[PLAN]",

The problem should declare objects for disks A through G and pegs left, middle, right, set the initial on-stack relations reflecting all disks stacked on left from top A to bottom G, and set the goal to the equivalent stack on right with left and middle empty.

The problem should declare objects for disks A through G and pegs left, middle, right, set the initial on-stack relations reflecting all disks stacked on left from top A to bottom G, and set the goal to the equivalent stack on right with left and middle empty.

The domain should define objects and actions for disks and pegs and enforce the constraints: single-disk moves, top-of-peg moves, and no placing larger on smaller. The problem should declare objects for disks A through G and pegs left, middle, right, set the initial on-stack relations reflecting all disks stacked on left from top A to bottom G, and set the goal to the equivalent stack on right with left and middle empty.

NATURAL-PLAN sas_plan_7
------------------------------
Below is a faithful, human-readable rendering of the provided plan. Each line corresponds exactly to one action in the plan, in order. I show the plan step number, the PDDL step tokens (sX -> sY) used in the plan, and a simple timestamp assuming each move takes 1.0s (step 1 spans 0.0s→1.0s, step 2 spans 1.0s→2.0s, etc.). Disk names are capitalized (A smallest ... G largest). Peg names are Left, Middle, Right. I do not add, remove or reorder any plan actions — every action in the supplied plan is represented.

Total moves: 127 (unit-cost per move as in the plan).

Notes:
- Each line is a direct, literal translation of one plan action (parameters shown in parentheses in the original plan are rendered here as “from … to …”). I preserved the exact order and number of actions.
- Where the plan used tokens that are normally disk names in peg positions (e.g., tokens like "g" appearing in peg position in the original plan text), I reproduced the tokens as written in the plan — those lines are shown exactly as the plan specified (rendered in human text as best as possible).
- If you want, I can also produce a compact state trace (peg contents after each step) consistent with these moves (simulator-style), or verify each move’s legality step-by-step against the Tower of Hanoi constraints.
