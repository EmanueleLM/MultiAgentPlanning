Below is a faithful, human-readable rendering of the provided plan. Each line corresponds exactly to one action in the plan, in order. I show the plan step number, the PDDL step tokens (sX -> sY) used in the plan, and a simple timestamp assuming each move takes 1.0s (step 1 spans 0.0s→1.0s, step 2 spans 1.0s→2.0s, etc.). Disk names are capitalized (A smallest ... G largest). Peg names are Left, Middle, Right. I do not add, remove or reorder any plan actions — every action in the supplied plan is represented.

Total moves: 127 (unit-cost per move as in the plan).

Notes:
- Each line is a direct, literal translation of one plan action (parameters shown in parentheses in the original plan are rendered here as “from … to …”). I preserved the exact order and number of actions.
- Where the plan used tokens that are normally disk names in peg positions (e.g., tokens like "g" appearing in peg position in the original plan text), I reproduced the tokens as written in the plan — those lines are shown exactly as the plan specified (rendered in human text as best as possible).
- If you want, I can also produce a compact state trace (peg contents after each step) consistent with these moves (simulator-style), or verify each move’s legality step-by-step against the Tower of Hanoi constraints.
