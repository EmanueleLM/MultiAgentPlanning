This sequence faithfully follows the provided plan (127 unit moves, stages s0 through s127). Each step is a legal single-disk top move that preserves the Tower of Hanoi invariants (only the top disk moves; no larger disk is ever placed on a smaller disk). The final state after step 127 is the required goal: all disks stacked on the right peg from top to bottom A B C D E F G, with left and middle pegs empty, and at-stage s127.
