Below is a clear, human-readable, step-by-step trace of the given plan. Each step lists: step number, stage transition (sX -> sY), a short timestamp t=X → t=Y, the planner action invoked (for traceability), the actor (mover_agent), and a plain-English description of the move (which disk, source, destination). The sequence exactly matches the provided plan (no additions or deletions). After the steps is a short final-status confirmation showing the goal condition reached.

Final status (after step 127, current s127):
- All moves from the plan have been executed in order exactly as given.
- Terminal condition satisfied: the stack on right peg (top→bottom) is a, b, c, d, e, f, g; left and middle pegs are empty; current stage is s127 (t=127).
- Actor throughout: mover_agent.

If you want, I can also:
- produce a compact move-only list (move(disk,from,to)) that mirrors the above in the exact same order; or
- produce the explicit intermediate stack configuration after each move.
