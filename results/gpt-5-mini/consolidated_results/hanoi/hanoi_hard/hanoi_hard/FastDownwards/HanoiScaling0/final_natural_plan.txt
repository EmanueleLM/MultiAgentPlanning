44. Time s44 -> s45: Move disk C from right (on top of F) to middle (place onto D).
45. Time s45 -> s46: Move disk A from left (on top of B) to right (place onto F).
46. Time s46 -> s47: Move disk B from left (on top of E) to middle (place onto C).

62. Time s62 -> s63: Move disk B from middle (on base) to right (place onto C).
63. Time s63 -> s64: Move disk A from left (on base) to right (place onto B).

Final state (after time s63 -> s64): All disks A (top), B, C, D, E, F (bottom) are on the right peg in correct stack order; left and middle pegs are empty. This sequence is the 63-step solution (2^6 - 1 moves) and matches the provided plan exactly.
