Assumptions (stated explicitly):
- Moves are executed sequentially. Assume each move takes 1 time unit. I label timestamps so step N spans time t = N-1 → N.
- I report the stage change from sX → sY exactly as in the plan.
- “From <object>” indicates the object the disk was directly on before the move; that object may be a peg (left/middle/right) or another disk (A–F). “Onto <object>” indicates the disk or peg that becomes the new direct support.

Final confirmation:
- After the last move (Step 63, at t=63, stage s63), the plan reaches the final stage s63 as required.
- The sequence above matches each action in the provided plan exactly (I did not add or remove any moves), reports source and destination objects precisely as in the plan, and provides timestamps and stage transitions for every move.
