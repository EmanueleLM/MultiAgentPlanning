Below is the human-readable, step-by-step move sequence that exactly follows the provided PDDL plan (63 moves). I map disks d1..d6 → A..F (A smallest, F largest) and pegs peg-left / peg-middle / peg-right → left / middle / right. Each step shows the PDDL step indices and a simple timestamp assuming 1 unit time per move (stepN -> stepN+1 shown as t=N s → t=N+1 s).
