Below is a step-by-step, human-readable trace of the plan. Each step corresponds exactly to one action from the supplied PDDL plan (no actions added or removed). I report a simple timestamp and a fixed duration of 1s per move for clarity.

Notes:
- Each step above corresponds in order and content to the exact action listed in the provided PDDL plan.
- Each step assumes a move duration of 1s and timestamps increment by 1s for readability.
- Disk names and peg names match the plan (a–f and left, middle, right).
