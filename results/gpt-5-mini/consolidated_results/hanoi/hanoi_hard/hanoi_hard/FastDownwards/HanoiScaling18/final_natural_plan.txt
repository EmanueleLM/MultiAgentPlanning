Assumptions and conventions
- Disk names follow the PDDL plan (lowercase): a (smallest) ... f (largest). This matches the specification ordering (A..F smallest→largest).
- Peg names: left, middle, right.
- Time is discrete: each action advances the stage from sN to sN+1. I report each action as "Time step N (stage sN-1 → sN)". Actions are instantaneous and atomic (no duration beyond advancing the stage).
- When I say "move disk X from Y to Z": Y is the direct support the disk was on (either another disk or a peg); Z is the destination (either a peg or another disk). "onto disk D" implies D was clear (had nothing on top) prior to the move.

Final state summary (after Time step 63)
- Stage s63 is current (the plan enforces exactly 63 moves).
- Middle peg holds the full stack from top to bottom: a, b, c, d, e, f (matching the goal).
- Left and right pegs are empty at termination (matching the goal constraint).

This sequence matches the provided plan exactly (63 moves), respects the Tower of Hanoi rules (only top disks moved, never placing a larger disk on a smaller), and uses the discrete stage progression s0 → ... → s63 as timestamps for each action.
