Summary: Each step below is one primitive move taking 1 time unit. I list steps 1–63, with timestamps corresponding to the stage transitions (stage0 → stage1 is time 0→1, etc.). The disk names are a (smallest) through f (largest). Peg names: left, middle, right.

4. Time 3 → 4 (duration 1): Move disk c from right to left (to empty peg).
