Summary: 63 moves, each move takes 1 time unit. Time t=0 is the initial state (all disks A..F stacked on LEFT, top→bottom A,B,C,D,E,F). Each step lists the start and end time (t = start → end) and the concrete move executed.

1. t=0 → t=1: Move A from on top of disk B to peg RIGHT.
2. t=1 → t=2: Move B from on top of disk C to peg MIDDLE.
