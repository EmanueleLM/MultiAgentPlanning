Below is a human-readable, step-by-step rendering of the supplied plan. Each move is shown in order, labeled with the stage transition (sN → sN+1) which serves as the timestamp; each move is an atomic step (duration: 1 move). Disk names are A (smallest) through F (largest); pegs are Left, Middle, Right. I follow the plan exactly — no actions added or removed.
