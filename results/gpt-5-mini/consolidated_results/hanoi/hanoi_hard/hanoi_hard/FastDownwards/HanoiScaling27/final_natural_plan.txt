Below is the human-readable, step-by-step move sequence that matches the provided PDDL plan exactly. Each step shows the stage transition (sN -> sN+1) and reports the disk moved, the source peg -> destination peg, and (when present in the action parameters) the disk it was on or the disk it was placed onto. Each move corresponds to one stage advance (treated as 1 time unit).

Final note: each listed move corresponds exactly to one action in the provided plan and advances the stage by one (sN -> sN+1). Treat each move as taking one time unit (the stage transition). The sequence produces the specified final configuration: all disks F (bottom) up to A (top) on the left peg, with middle and right pegs empty, reaching stage s63.
