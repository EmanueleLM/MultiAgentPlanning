Below is a step-by-step, human-readable trace of the given plan. Each step lists the original plan action, the timestamp (stage) transition used as a simple time marker, and a concise description of what happens (precondition and immediate postcondition). I follow the plan exactly in order and do not add or remove any actions. I use uppercase disk names (A–F) for readability; peg names are left, middle, right. Each stage transition stX -> stY is treated as a unit time step (duration 1).

- Right peg: empty.
- Stage: at-stage st63 (final).

Notes/assurances:
- Each step corresponds exactly to an action in the provided plan (no actions added or removed).
- Each time marker uses the stage transition given in the plan (stX -> stY); I treat each transition as a unit-duration step.
- Preconditions and immediate postconditions stated are the straightforward, local effects implied by each domain action (top/below and peg-empty updates). No concurrency or bookkeeping shortcuts are assumed: actions are sequential and respect the Tower of Hanoi rules (single top-disk moves, never placing a larger disk on a smaller one).
