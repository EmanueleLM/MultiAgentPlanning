PROBLEM
------------------------------
I am practicing the Tower of Hanoi puzzle. Here is the action I can do

Move the top disk from one peg to another peg

I must obey the following rules:
I can move only one disk at a time.
I may only move a disk that is on top of a peg.
I can never place a larger disk on top of a smaller disk.
Once a disk is moved, it keeps its relative size ordering with the others.

[STATEMENT]
There are 6 disks in total. From smallest to largest they are disk A, disk B, disk C, disk D, disk E, and disk F.
As initial conditions I have that, the middle peg holds, from top to bottom, disk A, disk B, disk C, disk D, disk E, and disk F, while the left peg and the right peg are empty.
My goal is to have that the right peg holds, from top to bottom, disk A, disk B, disk C, disk D, disk E, and disk F, and both the middle peg and the left peg are empty again.
The left peg can be used as an intermediate parking spot but must end up empty.

My plan is as follows:

From smallest to largest they are disk A, disk B, disk C, disk D, disk E, and disk F.\nAs initial conditions I have that, the middle peg holds, from top to bottom, disk A, disk B, disk C, disk D, disk E, and disk F, while the left peg and the right peg are empty.\nMy goal is to have that the right peg holds, from top to bottom, disk A, disk B, disk C, disk D, disk E, and disk F, and both the middle peg and the left peg are empty again.\nThe left peg can be used as an intermediate parking spot but must end up empty.\n\nMy plan is as follows:\n\n[PLAN]",

62. Time s62 -> s63: Move disk B from middle (on base) to right (place onto C).
63. Time s63 -> s64: Move disk A from left (on base) to right (place onto B).

Final state (after time s63 -> s64): All disks A (top), B, C, D, E, F (bottom) are on the right peg in correct stack order; left and middle pegs are empty. This sequence is the 63-step solution (2^6 - 1 moves) and matches the provided plan exactly.
================================================================================


PROBLEM
------------------------------
I am practicing the Tower of Hanoi puzzle. Here is the action I can do

Move the top disk from one peg to another peg

I must obey the following rules:
I can move only one disk at a time.
I may only move a disk that is on top of a peg.
I can never place a larger disk on top of a smaller disk.
Once a disk is moved, it keeps its relative size ordering with the others.

[STATEMENT]
There are 6 disks in total. From smallest to largest they are disk A, disk B, disk C, disk D, disk E, and disk F.
As initial conditions I have that, the right peg holds, from top to bottom, disk A, disk B, disk C, disk D, disk E, and disk F, while the middle peg and the left peg are empty.
My goal is to have that the left peg holds, from top to bottom, disk A, disk B, disk C, disk D, disk E, and disk F, and both the right peg and the middle peg are empty again.
The middle peg can be used as an intermediate parking spot but must end up empty.

My plan is as follows:

- Move disk B from peg right to on top of disk C.

Step 63 (t = 62s) — stage62 → stage63:
- Move disk A from peg middle to on top of disk B.

Final summary (t = 62s, after stage63 reached):
- All 63 planned moves have been executed in order (stage0 → stage63).
- Final configuration achieved (as required): all disks A (top) through F (bottom) are stacked on peg left in correct order; pegs middle and right are empty.
- Total moves: 63. Total elapsed time (with 1s/move assumption): 63 seconds.

This sequence matches exactly the provided PDDL plan (no moves were added or removed) and corresponds to the canonical 2^6 - 1 = 63 move solution for transferring the 6-disk stack from right to left using middle as intermediate.

PROBLEM
------------------------------
I am practicing the Tower of Hanoi puzzle. Here is the action I can do

Move the top disk from one peg to another peg

I must obey the following rules:
I can move only one disk at a time.
I may only move a disk that is on top of a peg.
I can never place a larger disk on top of a smaller disk.
Once a disk is moved, it keeps its relative size ordering with the others.

[STATEMENT]
There are 6 disks in total. From smallest to largest they are disk A, disk B, disk C, disk D, disk E, and disk F.
As initial conditions I have that, the left peg holds, from top to bottom, disk A, disk B, disk C, disk D, disk E, and disk F, while the middle peg and the right peg are empty.
My goal is to have that the right peg holds, from top to bottom, disk A, disk B, disk C, disk D, disk E, and disk F, and both the left peg and the middle peg are empty again.
The middle peg can be used as an intermediate parking spot but must end up empty.

My plan is as follows:

FINAL-PLAN
------------------------------
<domain>
(define (domain hanoi-6disk)
  ; Tower of Hanoi domain for 6 disks (FastDownwards-compatible).
  ; Decisions / resolutions (documented as comments):
  ; - Pegs are named pegA, pegB, pegC. Initial stack is all disks on pegA (classic setup).
  ; - Disks are disk1 .. disk6 with disk1 the smallest and disk6 the largest.
  ; - We avoid a mixed "support" type to keep typing simple and solver-friendly:
  ;   there are separate predicates for a disk being on a peg (on-peg) and on another disk (on-disk).
  ; - Top-only moves are enforced by requiring the moved disk to be clear (clear-disk).
  ; - The never-larger-on-smaller invariant is enforced by permitting moves onto a disk only when
  ;   the moved disk is strictly smaller than the target disk via the static predicate (smaller ?d ?t).
  ; - To avoid disjunctive preconditions we provide four concrete move actions to cover all source/target type combinations.
  ; - All natural-language preferences (e.g., "must not place larger on smaller") are encoded as hard constraints.
  ; - No bookkeeping/penalty actions or post-hoc fixes are provided.

DOMAIN
------------------------------
(define (domain hanoi-6disk)
  ; Tower of Hanoi domain for 6 disks (FastDownwards-compatible).
  ; Decisions / resolutions (documented as comments):
  ; - Pegs are named pegA, pegB, pegC. Initial stack is all disks on pegA (classic setup).
  ; - Disks are disk1 .. disk6 with disk1 the smallest and disk6 the largest.
  ; - We avoid a mixed "support" type to keep typing simple and solver-friendly:
  ;   there are separate predicates for a disk being on a peg (on-peg) and on another disk (on-disk).
  ; - Top-only moves are enforced by requiring the moved disk to be clear (clear-disk).
  ; - The never-larger-on-smaller invariant is enforced by permitting moves onto a disk only when
  ;   the moved disk is strictly smaller than the target disk via the static predicate (smaller ?d ?t).
  ; - To avoid disjunctive preconditions we provide four concrete move actions to cover all source/target type combinations.
  ; - All natural-language preferences (e.g., "must not place larger on smaller") are encoded as hard constraints.
  ; - No bookkeeping/penalty actions or post-hoc fixes are provided.

NATURAL-PLAN sas_plan_9
------------------------------
Summary / naming
- Pegs: pega = Left peg (Peg A), pegb = Middle peg (Peg B), pegc = Right peg (Peg C).
- Disks (smallest → largest): diska = A (smallest), diskb = B, diskc = C, diskd = D, diske = E, diskf = F (largest).
- Timing convention: each plan action advances from stepN to stepN+1. I report each as "time N → N+1" and assume duration 1 time unit per move.
- All moves are single-disk, top-only, and place no larger disk on a smaller one (plan follows the domain invariants).

Step-by-step actions (time step → step+1, duration = 1 unit each)

1. Time 0 → 1: Move disk A (diska) from Left peg (pega) to Middle peg (pegb).  
2. Time 1 → 2: Move disk B (diskb) from Left peg (pega) to Right peg (pegc).

62. Time 61 → 62: Move disk B (diskb) from Left peg (pega) onto disk C (diskc) on Right peg (pegc).  
63. Time 62 → 63: Move disk A (diska) from Middle peg (pegb) onto disk B (diskb) on Right peg (pegc).

Result / goal check
- At time 63 (step63): Right peg (pegc) holds from top to bottom A, B, C, D, E, F (diska on diskb on diskc on diskd on diske on diskf). Left (pega) and Middle (pegb) are empty. Current step = step63. The described sequence matches the provided plan exactly and respects the Tower of Hanoi constraints (single top-disk moves, never placing larger on smaller).

PROBLEM
------------------------------
I am practicing the Tower of Hanoi puzzle. Here is the action I can do

Move the top disk from one peg to another peg

I must obey the following rules:
I can move only one disk at a time.
I may only move a disk that is on top of a peg.
I can never place a larger disk on top of a smaller disk.
Once a disk is moved, it keeps its relative size ordering with the others.

[STATEMENT]
There are 6 disks in total. From smallest to largest they are disk A, disk B, disk C, disk D, disk E, and disk F.
As initial conditions I have that, the left peg holds, from top to bottom, disk A, disk B, disk C, disk D, disk E, and disk F, while the middle peg and the right peg are empty.
My goal is to have that the right peg holds, from top to bottom, disk A, disk B, disk C, disk D, disk E, and disk F, and both the left peg and the middle peg are empty again.
The middle peg can be used as an intermediate parking spot but must end up empty.

My plan is as follows:

From smallest to largest they are disk A, disk B, disk C, disk D, disk E, and disk F.\nAs initial conditions I have that, the left peg holds, from top to bottom, disk A, disk B, disk C, disk D, disk E, and disk F, while the middle peg and the right peg are empty.\nMy goal is to have that the right peg holds, from top to bottom, disk A, disk B, disk C, disk D, disk E, and disk F, and both the left peg and the middle peg are empty again.\nThe middle peg can be used as an intermediate parking spot but must end up empty.\n\nMy plan is as follows:\n\n[PLAN]",

PROBLEM
------------------------------
I am practicing the Tower of Hanoi puzzle. Here is the action I can do

Move the top disk from one peg to another peg

I must obey the following rules:
I can move only one disk at a time.
I may only move a disk that is on top of a peg.
I can never place a larger disk on top of a smaller disk.
Once a disk is moved, it keeps its relative size ordering with the others.

[STATEMENT]
There are 6 disks in total. From smallest to largest they are disk A, disk B, disk C, disk D, disk E, and disk F.
As initial conditions I have that, the left peg holds, from top to bottom, disk A, disk B, disk C, disk D, disk E, and disk F, while the right peg and the middle peg are empty.
My goal is to have that the middle peg holds, from top to bottom, disk A, disk B, disk C, disk D, disk E, and disk F, and both the left peg and the right peg are empty again.
The right peg can be used as an intermediate parking spot but must end up empty.

My plan is as follows:

Enclose the PDDL domain between <domain></domain> tags and the PDDL problem between <problem></problem> tags. Ensure actions remain distinct if representing multiple actors or conceptual roles. Use only constructs supported by Fast Downward and avoid planner-specific extensions unless they are standard in Fast Downward. Ensure the model enforces single-disk moves, top-disk-only preconditions, and size-ordering constraints so larger disks never end up on smaller ones.
