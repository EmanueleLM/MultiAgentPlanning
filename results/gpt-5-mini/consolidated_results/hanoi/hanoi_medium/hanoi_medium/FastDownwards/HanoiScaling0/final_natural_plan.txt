5. s4 -> s5: move-disk-onto-disk a (from on-disk b) onto disk d. Duration: 1 stage.
6. s5 -> s6: move-peg-onto-disk b (from peg left) onto disk c. Duration: 1 stage.
7. s6 -> s7: move-disk-onto-disk a (from on-disk d) onto disk b. Duration: 1 stage.
8. s7 -> s8: move-disk-to-peg d (from on-disk e) to peg left. Duration: 1 stage.
9. s8 -> s9: move-disk-onto-disk a (from on-disk b) onto disk d. Duration: 1 stage.
10. s9 -> s10: move-disk-onto-disk b (from on-disk c) onto disk e. Duration: 1 stage.
11. s10 -> s11: move-disk-onto-disk a (from on-disk d) onto disk b. Duration: 1 stage.
12. s11 -> s12: move-peg-onto-disk c (from peg right) onto disk d. Duration: 1 stage.
13. s12 -> s13: move-disk-to-peg a (from on-disk b) to peg right. Duration: 1 stage.
14. s13 -> s14: move-disk-onto-disk b (from on-disk e) onto disk c. Duration: 1 stage.
15. s14 -> s15: move-peg-onto-disk a (from peg right) onto disk b. Duration: 1 stage.
16. s15 -> s16: move-peg-to-peg e (from peg middle) to peg right. Duration: 1 stage.
17. s16 -> s17: move-disk-to-peg a (from on-disk b) to peg middle. Duration: 1 stage.
18. s17 -> s18: move-disk-onto-disk b (from on-disk c) onto disk e. Duration: 1 stage.
19. s18 -> s19: move-peg-onto-disk a (from peg middle) onto disk b. Duration: 1 stage.
20. s19 -> s20: move-disk-to-peg c (from on-disk d) to peg middle. Duration: 1 stage.
21. s20 -> s21: move-disk-onto-disk a (from on-disk b) onto disk d. Duration: 1 stage.

23. s22 -> s23: move-disk-onto-disk a (from on-disk d) onto disk b. Duration: 1 stage.
24. s23 -> s24: move-peg-onto-disk d (from peg left) onto disk e. Duration: 1 stage.
25. s24 -> s25: move-disk-onto-disk a (from on-disk b) onto disk d. Duration: 1 stage.
26. s25 -> s26: move-disk-to-peg b (from on-disk c) to peg left. Duration: 1 stage.
27. s26 -> s27: move-disk-onto-disk a (from on-disk d) onto disk b. Duration: 1 stage.
28. s27 -> s28: move-peg-onto-disk c (from peg middle) onto disk d. Duration: 1 stage.
29. s28 -> s29: move-disk-to-peg a (from on-disk b) to peg middle. Duration: 1 stage.
30. s29 -> s30: move-peg-onto-disk b (from peg left) onto disk c. Duration: 1 stage.
31. s30 -> s31: move-peg-onto-disk a (from peg middle) onto disk b. Duration: 1 stage.

Final state (stage s31): right peg holds, from top to bottom, a, b, c, d, e; left and middle pegs are empty; stage = s31. Total moves: 31.
