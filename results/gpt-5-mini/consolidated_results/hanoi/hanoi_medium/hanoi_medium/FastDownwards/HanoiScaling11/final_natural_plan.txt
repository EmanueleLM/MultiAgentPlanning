Summary: sequence of 31 explicit legal moves (each move takes 1 time unit). Time starts at t=0. Step N occurs from t=(N-1) to t=N.

1. Step 1 (t=0 → t=1, duration 1): Move disk a from middle peg (it was on disk b) to right peg (onto empty peg).
2. Step 2 (t=1 → t=2, duration 1): Move disk b from middle peg (it was on disk c) to left peg (onto empty peg).
3. Step 3 (t=2 → t=3, duration 1): Move disk a from right peg (top) to left peg, placing it on top of disk b.
4. Step 4 (t=3 → t=4, duration 1): Move disk c from middle peg (it was on disk d) to right peg (onto empty peg).
