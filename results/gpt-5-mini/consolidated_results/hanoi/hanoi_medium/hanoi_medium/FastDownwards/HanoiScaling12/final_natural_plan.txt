Below is a human-readable, step-by-step rendering of the provided plan. Each line corresponds exactly to one action in the plan, in the same order, showing the action name, what disk moves, from where to where, and the stage/timestamp (one-step duration: sN → sN+1).

1) (move-disk-to-peg a b left) — Move disk A from on top of disk B to peg left. Stage s0 → s1 (1 step)

2) (move-disk-to-peg b c middle) — Move disk B from on top of disk C to peg middle. Stage s1 → s2 (1 step)

3) (move-peg-to-disk a left b) — Move disk A from peg left onto disk B (on middle). Stage s2 → s3 (1 step)

4) (move-disk-to-peg c d left) — Move disk C from on top of disk D to peg left. Stage s3 → s4 (1 step)

5) (move-disk-to-disk a b d) — Move disk A from on top of disk B (middle) onto disk D (on left). Stage s4 → s5 (1 step)

6) (move-peg-to-disk b middle c) — Move disk B from peg middle onto disk C (on left). Stage s5 → s6 (1 step)

7) (move-disk-to-disk a d b) — Move disk A from on top of disk D (left) onto disk B (now on C). Stage s6 → s7 (1 step)

8) (move-disk-to-peg d e middle) — Move disk D from on top of disk E to peg middle. Stage s7 → s8 (1 step)

9) (move-disk-to-disk a b d) — Move disk A from on top of disk B onto disk D. Stage s8 → s9 (1 step)

10) (move-disk-to-disk b c e) — Move disk B from on top of disk C onto disk E. Stage s9 → s10 (1 step)

11) (move-disk-to-disk a d b) — Move disk A from on top of disk D onto disk B. Stage s10 → s11 (1 step)

12) (move-peg-to-disk c left d) — Move disk C from peg left onto disk D. Stage s11 → s12 (1 step)

13) (move-disk-to-peg a b left) — Move disk A from on top of disk B to peg left. Stage s12 → s13 (1 step)

14) (move-disk-to-disk b e c) — Move disk B from on top of disk E onto disk C. Stage s13 → s14 (1 step)

15) (move-peg-to-disk a left b) — Move disk A from peg left onto disk B. Stage s14 → s15 (1 step)

16) (move-peg-to-peg e right left) — Move disk E from peg right to peg left (E is the bottom disk). Stage s15 → s16 (1 step)

17) (move-disk-to-peg a b right) — Move disk A from on top of disk B to peg right. Stage s16 → s17 (1 step)

18) (move-disk-to-disk b c e) — Move disk B from on top of disk C onto disk E. Stage s17 → s18 (1 step)

19) (move-peg-to-disk a right b) — Move disk A from peg right onto disk B. Stage s18 → s19 (1 step)

20) (move-disk-to-peg c d right) — Move disk C from on top of disk D to peg right. Stage s19 → s20 (1 step)

21) (move-disk-to-disk a b d) — Move disk A from on top of disk B onto disk D. Stage s20 → s21 (1 step)

22) (move-disk-to-disk b e c) — Move disk B from on top of disk E onto disk C. Stage s21 → s22 (1 step)

23) (move-disk-to-disk a d b) — Move disk A from on top of disk D onto disk B. Stage s22 → s23 (1 step)

24) (move-peg-to-disk d middle e) — Move disk D from peg middle onto disk E. Stage s23 → s24 (1 step)

25) (move-disk-to-disk a b d) — Move disk A from on top of disk B onto disk D. Stage s24 → s25 (1 step)

26) (move-disk-to-peg b c middle) — Move disk B from on top of disk C to peg middle. Stage s25 → s26 (1 step)

27) (move-disk-to-disk a d b) — Move disk A from on top of disk D onto disk B. Stage s26 → s27 (1 step)

28) (move-peg-to-disk c right d) — Move disk C from peg right onto disk D. Stage s27 → s28 (1 step)

29) (move-disk-to-peg a b right) — Move disk A from on top of disk B to peg right. Stage s28 → s29 (1 step)

30) (move-peg-to-disk b middle c) — Move disk B from peg middle onto disk C. Stage s29 → s30 (1 step)

31) (move-peg-to-disk a right b) — Move disk A from peg right onto disk B. Stage s30 → s31 (1 step)

Final verification (after s31): The left peg holds the full stack (bottom E, then D, C, B, top A); middle and right pegs are empty; time-now s31. This matches the goal condition.
