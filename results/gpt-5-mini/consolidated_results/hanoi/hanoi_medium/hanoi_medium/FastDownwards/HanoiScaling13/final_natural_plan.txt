Below is a step-by-step, human-readable trace of the plan. Each line corresponds exactly to one action in the supplied plan, in order. I report the stage/timepoint transition for each move; each move advances the stage by one (duration: 1 stage).

1. Step 1 (s0 → s1, duration 1 stage): Move disk A from on top of disk B to peg middle.
2. Step 2 (s1 → s2, duration 1 stage): Move disk B from on top of disk C to peg left.
3. Step 3 (s2 → s3, duration 1 stage): Move disk A from peg middle onto disk B.
4. Step 4 (s3 → s4, duration 1 stage): Move disk C from on top of disk D to peg middle.
5. Step 5 (s4 → s5, duration 1 stage): Move disk A from on top of disk B onto disk D.
6. Step 6 (s5 → s6, duration 1 stage): Move disk B from peg left onto disk C.
7. Step 7 (s6 → s7, duration 1 stage): Move disk A from on top of disk D onto disk B.
8. Step 8 (s7 → s8, duration 1 stage): Move disk D from on top of disk E to peg left.
9. Step 9 (s8 → s9, duration 1 stage): Move disk A from on top of disk B onto disk D.
10. Step 10 (s9 → s10, duration 1 stage): Move disk B from on top of disk C onto disk E.
11. Step 11 (s10 → s11, duration 1 stage): Move disk A from on top of disk D onto disk B.
12. Step 12 (s11 → s12, duration 1 stage): Move disk C from peg middle onto disk D.
13. Step 13 (s12 → s13, duration 1 stage): Move disk A from on top of disk B to peg middle.
14. Step 14 (s13 → s14, duration 1 stage): Move disk B from on top of disk E onto disk C.
15. Step 15 (s14 → s15, duration 1 stage): Move disk A from peg middle onto disk B.
16. Step 16 (s15 → s16, duration 1 stage): Move disk E from peg right to peg middle.
17. Step 17 (s16 → s17, duration 1 stage): Move disk A from on top of disk B to peg right.
18. Step 18 (s17 → s18, duration 1 stage): Move disk B from on top of disk C onto disk E.
19. Step 19 (s18 → s19, duration 1 stage): Move disk A from peg right onto disk B.
20. Step 20 (s19 → s20, duration 1 stage): Move disk C from on top of disk D to peg right.
21. Step 21 (s20 → s21, duration 1 stage): Move disk A from on top of disk B onto disk D.
22. Step 22 (s21 → s22, duration 1 stage): Move disk B from on top of disk E onto disk C.
23. Step 23 (s22 → s23, duration 1 stage): Move disk A from on top of disk D onto disk B.
24. Step 24 (s23 → s24, duration 1 stage): Move disk D from peg left onto disk E.
25. Step 25 (s24 → s25, duration 1 stage): Move disk A from on top of disk B onto disk D.
26. Step 26 (s25 → s26, duration 1 stage): Move disk B from on top of disk C to peg left.
27. Step 27 (s26 → s27, duration 1 stage): Move disk A from on top of disk D onto disk B.
28. Step 28 (s27 → s28, duration 1 stage): Move disk C from peg right onto disk D.
29. Step 29 (s28 → s29, duration 1 stage): Move disk A from on top of disk B to peg right.
30. Step 30 (s29 → s30, duration 1 stage): Move disk B from peg left onto disk C.
31. Step 31 (s30 → s31, duration 1 stage): Move disk A from peg right onto disk B.

Summary: 31 moves, advancing the stage from s0 to s31 (cost = 31). At s31 the goal is reached: all disks A (top), B, C, D, E (bottom) are on peg middle, and pegs left and right are empty.
