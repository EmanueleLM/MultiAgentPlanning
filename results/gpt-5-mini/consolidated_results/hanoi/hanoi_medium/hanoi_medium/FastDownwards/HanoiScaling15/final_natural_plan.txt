Below is a clear, step-by-step, human-readable rendering of the provided PDDL plan. Each step lists the PDDL action (with its step parameters), a timestamp (one time unit per step), and a concise natural-language description of the move and why it is legal at that moment.

Assumption for timestamps/durations: each action occurs at integer time t = step index and takes 1 time unit.

1. Time t=1 — (move-disk-to-peg step1 step2 a b middle)
   - Move disk a (top disk) from on top of disk b to the middle peg.
   - Legality: a is the top disk on its peg and middle is empty.

2. Time t=2 — (move-disk-to-peg step2 step3 b c left)
   - Move disk b (top disk) from on top of disk c to the left peg.
   - Legality: b is top on its peg and left is empty.

3. Time t=3 — (move-peg-to-disk step3 step4 a middle b)
   - Move disk a from the middle peg onto disk b (i.e., place a on top of b).
   - Legality: a is on the middle peg and top; b is a top disk and a is smaller than b.

Final state after t=31 (goal achieved):
- All disks are stacked on the middle peg in order (bottom to top): e, d, c, b, a.
- Left and right pegs are empty.

This sequence exactly matches the provided PDDL plan (31 moves), preserves the rules (one disk at a time, only top disks moved, never place a larger disk on a smaller disk), and reaches the specified goal.
