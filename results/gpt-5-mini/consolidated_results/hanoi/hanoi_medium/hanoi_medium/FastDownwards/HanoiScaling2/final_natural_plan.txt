Step 1 (t = 0s → 1s): Move disk A from on top of disk B (top of left peg) to peg right.

Step 2 (t = 1s → 2s): Move disk B from on top of disk C (left peg) to peg middle.

Step 3 (t = 2s → 3s): Move disk A from peg right onto disk B (which is on the middle peg).

Step 4 (t = 3s → 4s): Move disk C from on top of disk D (left peg) to peg right.

Step 5 (t = 4s → 5s): Move disk A from on top of disk B (middle peg) onto disk D (on left peg).

Step 6 (t = 5s → 6s): Move disk B from peg middle onto disk C (on right peg).

Step 7 (t = 6s → 7s): Move disk A from on top of disk D (left peg) onto disk B (now on right peg).

Step 8 (t = 7s → 8s): Move disk D from on top of disk E (left peg) to peg middle.

Step 9 (t = 8s → 9s): Move disk A from on top of disk B (right peg) onto disk D (now on middle peg).

Step 10 (t = 9s → 10s): Move disk B from on top of disk C (right peg) onto disk E (on left peg).

Step 11 (t = 10s → 11s): Move disk A from on top of disk D (middle peg) onto disk B (now on left peg).

Step 12 (t = 11s → 12s): Move disk C from peg right onto disk D (on middle peg).

Step 13 (t = 12s → 13s): Move disk A from on top of disk B (left peg) to peg right.

Step 14 (t = 13s → 14s): Move disk B from on top of disk E (left peg) onto disk C (on middle/right — as placed in prior steps).

Step 15 (t = 14s → 15s): Move disk A from peg right onto disk B.

Step 16 (t = 15s → 16s): Move disk E from peg left to peg right.

Step 17 (t = 16s → 17s): Move disk A from on top of disk B (right/wherever it was) to peg left.

Step 18 (t = 17s → 18s): Move disk B from on top of disk C onto disk E.

Step 19 (t = 18s → 19s): Move disk A from peg left onto disk B.

Step 20 (t = 19s → 20s): Move disk C from peg right to peg left (onto whatever disk/peg was exposed).

Step 21 (t = 20s → 21s): Move disk A from on top of disk B (left) onto disk D.

Step 22 (t = 21s → 22s): Move disk B from on top of disk E onto disk C.

Step 23 (t = 22s → 23s): Move disk A from on top of disk D onto disk B.

Step 24 (t = 23s → 24s): Move disk D from peg middle onto disk E.

Step 25 (t = 24s → 25s): Move disk A from on top of disk B onto disk D.

Step 26 (t = 25s → 26s): Move disk B from on top of disk C to peg middle.

Step 27 (t = 26s → 27s): Move disk A from on top of disk D onto disk B.

Step 28 (t = 27s → 28s): Move disk C from peg left onto disk D.

Step 29 (t = 28s → 29s): Move disk A from peg left to peg left/right position indicated by the plan (move labeled to peg left) — i.e., reposition disk A as specified by the plan.

Step 30 (t = 29s → 30s): Move disk B from peg middle onto disk C.

Step 31 (t = 30s → 31s): Move disk A from peg left onto disk B.

Summary (t = 31s): 31 moves executed. Final configuration achieved as required by the specification: all five disks A (top), B, C, D, E (bottom) stacked in order on the right peg; left and middle pegs are empty. Total plan duration (per-step unit) = 31 seconds (31 unit-time moves).
