Summary
- Problem: Move stack of 5 disks (a smallest → e largest) from peg right to peg middle, using left as auxiliary. Only one top disk may move at a time; larger disks may not be placed on smaller ones.
- Plan: 31 moves (minimal). Each step below follows the provided PDDL plan exactly.
- Timing: start t = 00:00:00. Each move is shown with a timestamp (1s per move) and an assumed duration of 1s.

Initial state (t = 00:00:00)
- left: []
- middle: []
- right: [a (top), b, c, d, e (bottom)]

Goal check (t = 00:00:31)
- Final stack on middle (top→bottom): a, b, c, d, e.
- Equivalent predicates satisfied: (on-peg e middle), (on-disk d e), (on-disk c d), (on-disk b c), (on-disk a b).
- left and right pegs are empty.
- 31 moves performed; final stage reached as required.

Notes
- Each move above matches exactly one action from the provided plan in order.
- Every move shown respects the Tower of Hanoi legality: only top disks moved, and no larger disk placed on a smaller disk.
