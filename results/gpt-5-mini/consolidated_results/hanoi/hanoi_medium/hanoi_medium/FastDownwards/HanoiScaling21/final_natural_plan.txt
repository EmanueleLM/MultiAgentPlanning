Below is a clear, step-by-step human-readable trace of the 40 moves in the provided plan. Each step corresponds exactly to one plan action (no actions added or removed). I give a timestamp (starting at 00:00:00 and advancing by 1 second per move) and a 1s duration per move.

Notation: disks A (smallest) -> E (largest); pegs Left, Middle, Right. "from on top of disk X" means the disk was directly resting on disk X; "from peg P" means the disk was directly on that peg.

Result summary:
- Total moves: 40 (unit cost per move).
- Final configuration (top -> bottom on Middle peg): A, B, C, D, E.
- Left and Right pegs are empty.
- The final state matches the specified goal: the entire stack A-B-C-D-E is on Middle peg with Left and Right empty.
