Below is a step-by-step, human-readable rendering of the given plan. Each step corresponds exactly to one action in the plan, in order, and shows the stage transition (timestamp tN -> tN+1). Each move is the atomic operation "move the top disk from its current support to a destination (peg or disk)". For readability I identify disks by their PDDL names (a = smallest, e = largest) and pegs as left / middle / right. Each step takes one discrete stage (tN → tN+1).

1. Step 1, t0 -> t1: Move disk a from on top of disk b onto peg right. (move-to-peg a b right)
2. Step 2, t1 -> t2: Move disk b from on top of disk c onto peg left. (move-to-peg b c left)
3. Step 3, t2 -> t3: Move disk a from peg right onto disk b (on left). (move-onto-disk a right b)
4. Step 4, t3 -> t4: Move disk c from on top of disk d onto peg right. (move-to-peg c d right)
5. Step 5, t4 -> t5: Move disk a from on top of disk b onto disk d. (move-onto-disk a b d)
6. Step 6, t5 -> t6: Move disk b from peg left onto disk c. (move-onto-disk b left c)
7. Step 7, t6 -> t7: Move disk a from on top of disk d onto disk b. (move-onto-disk a d b)
8. Step 8, t7 -> t8: Move disk d from on top of disk e onto peg left. (move-to-peg d e left)
9. Step 9, t8 -> t9: Move disk a from on top of disk b onto disk d. (move-onto-disk a b d)
10. Step 10, t9 -> t10: Move disk b from on top of disk c onto disk e. (move-onto-disk b c e)
11. Step 11, t10 -> t11: Move disk a from on top of disk d onto disk b. (move-onto-disk a d b)
12. Step 12, t11 -> t12: Move disk c from on top of disk d onto disk right (i.e., place c on d which is on right). (move-onto-disk c right d)
13. Step 13, t12 -> t13: Move disk a from on top of disk b onto peg right. (move-to-peg a b right)
14. Step 14, t13 -> t14: Move disk b from on top of disk e onto disk c. (move-onto-disk b e c)
15. Step 15, t14 -> t15: Move disk a from peg right onto disk b. (move-onto-disk a right b)
16. Step 16, t15 -> t16: Move disk e from on top of peg middle onto peg right. (move-to-peg e middle right)
17. Step 17, t16 -> t17: Move disk a from on top of disk b onto peg middle. (move-to-peg a b middle)
18. Step 18, t17 -> t18: Move disk b from on top of disk c onto disk e. (move-onto-disk b c e)
19. Step 19, t18 -> t19: Move disk a from peg middle onto disk b. (move-onto-disk a middle b)
20. Step 20, t19 -> t20: Move disk c from on top of disk d onto peg middle. (move-to-peg c d middle)
21. Step 21, t20 -> t21: Move disk a from on top of disk b onto disk d. (move-onto-disk a b d)
22. Step 22, t21 -> t22: Move disk b from on top of disk e onto disk c. (move-onto-disk b e c)
23. Step 23, t22 -> t23: Move disk a from on top of disk d onto disk b. (move-onto-disk a d b)
24. Step 24, t23 -> t24: Move disk d from on top of disk e onto peg left. (move-onto-disk d left e)
25. Step 25, t24 -> t25: Move disk a from on top of disk b onto disk d. (move-onto-disk a b d)
26. Step 26, t25 -> t26: Move disk b from on top of disk c onto peg left. (move-to-peg b c left)
27. Step 27, t26 -> t27: Move disk a from on top of disk d onto disk b. (move-onto-disk a d b)
28. Step 28, t27 -> t28: Move disk c from on top of disk d onto disk middle. (move-onto-disk c middle d)
29. Step 29, t28 -> t29: Move disk a from on top of disk b onto peg middle. (move-to-peg a b middle)
30. Step 30, t29 -> t30: Move disk b from on top of disk c onto peg left. (move-onto-disk b left c)
31. Step 31, t30 -> t31: Move disk a from peg middle onto disk b. (move-onto-disk a middle b)

Final state after t31:
- Right peg holds the full stack (top to bottom): a, b, c, d, e.
- Left peg is empty (clear).
- Middle peg is empty (clear).
- Top disk a is clear.
- Current stage is t31. (Goal achieved.)

Each listed step corresponds exactly to the plan actions and advances the global stage by one step (tN → tN+1).
