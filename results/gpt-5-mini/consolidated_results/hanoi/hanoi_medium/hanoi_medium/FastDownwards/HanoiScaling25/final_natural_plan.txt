Below is a step-by-step, human-readable trace of the 31 moves in the provided plan. Each step lists the stage (sX→sY), a timestamp assuming each move takes 1 time unit (t = X → X+1), the PDDL token parameters, and a plain-English description. Disk and peg name mapping used throughout: da=A, db=B, dc=C, dd=D, de=E; pegl=Left peg, pegm=Middle peg, pegr=Right peg; basel/basem/baser = left/middle/right peg bases.

Summary / final state (after t = 31, stage s31):
- Total moves: 31 (t = 0 → 31).
- Middle peg (pegm) stack, top-to-bottom: A (da), B (db), C (dc), D (dd), E (de).
- Left peg (pegl) and Right peg (pegr) are empty (their bases basel and baser are the visible tops).
- The final goal (Middle peg holds A B C D E top-to-bottom; Left and Right empty) is satisfied at stage s31.
