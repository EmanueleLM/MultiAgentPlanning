Summary: adopt 1 time-unit per move. Each step lists the stage transition (sN → sN+1), an English description using disk names A (a) … E (e) and pegs left / middle / right, the time interval (t = N → N+1), and a short legality note (why the move is allowed).

1. Step 1 — s0 → s1, time 0 → 1:
   Move disk A (a) from on top of disk B (b) to peg left.
   Legality: A is the top disk on B; left peg is empty; placing a smaller disk onto an empty peg is legal.

2. Step 2 — s1 → s2, time 1 → 2:
   Move disk B (b) from on top of disk C (c) to peg right.
   Legality: B is top on C; right peg is empty; move is legal.

3. Step 3 — s2 → s3, time 2 → 3:
   Move disk A (a) from peg left onto disk B (b).
   Legality: A is on peg left and is clear; B is clear on top of C; A is smaller than B, so placing A onto B is legal.

4. Step 4 — s3 → s4, time 3 → 4:
   Move disk C (c) from on top of disk D (d) to peg left.
   Legality: C is top on D; left peg is empty (A moved off it); move is legal.

5. Step 5 — s4 → s5, time 4 → 5:
   Move disk A (a) from on top of disk B (b) to on top of disk D (d).
   Legality: A is top on B and D is clear (top of its stack); A is smaller than D.

6. Step 6 — s5 → s6, time 5 → 6:
   Move disk B (b) from peg right onto disk C (c).
   Legality: B is on peg right and clear; C is clear; B is smaller than C.

7. Step 7 — s6 → s7, time 6 → 7:
   Move disk A (a) from on top of disk D (d) to on top of disk B (b).
   Legality: A is top on D; B is clear after previous move; A smaller than B.

8. Step 8 — s7 → s8, time 7 → 8:
   Move disk D (d) from on top of disk E (e) to peg right.
   Legality: D is top on E; right peg is empty after B moved off it earlier; move is legal.

9. Step 9 — s8 → s9, time 8 → 9:
   Move disk A (a) from on top of disk B (b) to on top of disk D (d).
   Legality: A is top on B; D is clear (moved to peg right); A smaller than D.

10. Step 10 — s9 → s10, time 9 → 10:
    Move disk B (b) from on top of disk C (c) to on top of disk E (e).
    Legality: B is top on C; E is clear (bottom disk); B is smaller than E.

11. Step 11 — s10 → s11, time 10 → 11:
    Move disk A (a) from on top of disk D (d) to on top of disk B (b).
    Legality: A is top on D; B is clear after previous move; A smaller than B.

12. Step 12 — s11 → s12, time 11 → 12:
    Move disk C (c) from peg left onto disk D (d).
    Legality: C is on peg left and clear; D is clear (top of right peg); C smaller than D.

13. Step 13 — s12 → s13, time 12 → 13:
    Move disk A (a) from on top of disk B (b) to peg left.
    Legality: A is top on B; left peg is empty after C moved off it; move is legal.

14. Step 14 — s13 → s14, time 13 → 14:
    Move disk B (b) from on top of disk E (e) to on top of disk C (c).
    Legality: B is top on E; C is clear after moving onto D; B smaller than C.

15. Step 15 — s14 → s15, time 14 → 15:
    Move disk A (a) from peg left onto disk B (b).
    Legality: A is on peg left and clear; B is clear; A smaller than B.

16. Step 16 — s15 → s16, time 15 → 16:
    Move disk E (e) from peg middle to peg left.
    Legality: E was the bottom disk on the middle peg; middle peg becomes empty after moving E; left peg currently has space at bottom (no larger-on-smaller violation because E is largest).

17. Step 17 — s16 → s17, time 16 → 17:
    Move disk A (a) from on top of disk B (b) to peg middle.
    Legality: A is top on B; middle peg is now empty (E moved off it); move is legal.

18. Step 18 — s17 → s18, time 17 → 18:
    Move disk B (b) from on top of disk C (c) to on top of disk E (e).
    Legality: B is top on C; E is clear (E on left); B smaller than E.

19. Step 19 — s18 → s19, time 18 → 19:
    Move disk A (a) from peg middle onto disk B (b).
    Legality: A is on peg middle and clear; B is clear on E; A smaller than B.

20. Step 20 — s19 → s20, time 19 → 20:
    Move disk C (c) from on top of disk D (d) to peg middle.
    Legality: C is top on D; middle peg is empty after A moved off it; move is legal.

21. Step 21 — s20 → s21, time 20 → 21:
    Move disk A (a) from on top of disk B (b) to on top of disk D (d).
    Legality: A is top on B; D is clear; A smaller than D.

22. Step 22 — s21 → s22, time 21 → 22:
    Move disk B (b) from on top of disk E (e) to on top of disk C (c).
    Legality: B is top on E; C is clear after moving to middle; B smaller than C.

23. Step 23 — s22 → s23, time 22 → 23:
    Move disk A (a) from on top of disk D (d) to on top of disk B (b).
    Legality: A is top on D; B is clear; A smaller than B.

24. Step 24 — s23 → s24, time 23 → 24:
    Move disk D (d) from peg right onto disk E (e).
    Legality: D is on peg right and clear; E is clear on left and larger; D smaller than E.

25. Step 25 — s24 → s25, time 24 → 25:
    Move disk A (a) from on top of disk B (b) to on top of disk D (d).
    Legality: A is top on B; D is now clear after being moved onto E; A smaller than D.

26. Step 26 — s25 → s26, time 25 → 26:
    Move disk B (b) from on top of disk C (c) to peg right.
    Legality: B is top on C; right peg is empty after D moved off it; move is legal.

27. Step 27 — s26 → s27, time 26 → 27:
    Move disk A (a) from on top of disk D (d) to on top of disk B (b).
    Legality: A is top on D; B is clear on right; A smaller than B.

28. Step 28 — s27 → s28, time 27 → 28:
    Move disk C (c) from peg middle onto disk D (d).
    Legality: C is on peg middle and clear; D is clear on top of E; C smaller than D.

29. Step 29 — s28 → s29, time 28 → 29:
    Move disk A (a) from on top of disk B (b) to peg middle.
    Legality: A is top on B; middle peg is empty after C moved off it; move is legal.

30. Step 30 — s29 → s30, time 29 → 30:
    Move disk B (b) from peg right onto disk C (c).
    Legality: B is on peg right and clear; C is clear; B smaller than C.

31. Step 31 — s30 → s31, time 30 → 31:
    Move disk A (a) from peg middle onto disk B (b).
    Legality: A is on peg middle and clear; B is clear; A smaller than B.

Final state at time 31 (s31): left peg holds E (bottom) with D, C, B, A stacked on top (top → A,B,C,D,E), middle and right pegs are empty — goal achieved. Each move above follows the Tower of Hanoi rules: only the top disk is moved, only one disk per step, and a larger disk is never placed on a smaller disk.
