Notes on the overall execution and compliance with the specification:
- The sequence above exactly follows the plan provided (93 actions in total). No actions were added or removed.
- Each operator move respects the Tower of Hanoi rules in its preconditions: the moved disk must be top/clear, only one disk moved at a time, and any move onto another disk requires the moving disk to be smaller.
- Auditor actions explicitly enforce the operator → auditor → observer phase ordering for each step; observer actions advance the linear step counter (or mark finished on the final step).
- The timestamps are assigned sequentially (one second per action) to provide a temporal ordering and durations where possible. These timestamps are illustrative and show the temporal order and causal dependencies (operator action → auditor approval → observer confirmation for each step).

Final state guarantee (as achieved by this plan):
- After the final observer-record-final action, the finished flag is set and the goal predicates hold: disks stacked on middle in order (top a, then b, c, d, e), left and right pegs clear, and the process is finished.
