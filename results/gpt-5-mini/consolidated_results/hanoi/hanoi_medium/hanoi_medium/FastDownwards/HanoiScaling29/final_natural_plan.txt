Mapping (PDDL -> human-friendly names)
- Disks: a = Disk A (smallest), b = Disk B, c = Disk C, d = Disk D, e = Disk E (largest)
- Pegs: left = Left peg, middle = Middle peg, right = Right peg
- Time/stages: each action consumes one stage step; notation sN → sN+1 shows the timestamp interval for that action.

Plan — step-by-step (each step is a single stage step sN → sN+1)

1. Stage s0 → s1: Move top Disk A from on top of Disk B to the Left peg. (duration: 1 stage)
2. Stage s1 → s2: Move top Disk B from on top of Disk C to the Middle peg. (1 stage)
3. Stage s2 → s3: Move top Disk A from the Left peg onto Disk B. (1 stage)
4. Stage s3 → s4: Move top Disk C from on top of Disk D to the Left peg. (1 stage)
5. Stage s4 → s5: Move top Disk A from on top of Disk B onto Disk D. (1 stage)
6. Stage s5 → s6: Move top Disk B from the Middle peg onto Disk C. (1 stage)
7. Stage s6 → s7: Move top Disk A from on top of Disk D onto Disk B. (1 stage)
8. Stage s7 → s8: Move top Disk D from on top of Disk E to the Middle peg. (1 stage)
9. Stage s8 → s9: Move top Disk A from on top of Disk B onto Disk D. (1 stage)
10. Stage s9 → s10: Move top Disk B from on top of Disk C onto Disk E. (1 stage)
11. Stage s10 → s11: Move top Disk A from on top of Disk D onto Disk B. (1 stage)
12. Stage s11 → s12: Move top Disk C from the Left peg onto Disk D. (1 stage)
13. Stage s12 → s13: Move top Disk A from on top of Disk B to the Left peg. (1 stage)
14. Stage s13 → s14: Move top Disk B from on top of Disk E onto Disk C. (1 stage)
15. Stage s14 → s15: Move top Disk A from the Left peg onto Disk B. (1 stage)
16. Stage s15 → s16: Move top Disk E from the Right peg to the Left peg. (1 stage)
17. Stage s16 → s17: Move top Disk A from on top of Disk B to the Right peg. (1 stage)
18. Stage s17 → s18: Move top Disk B from on top of Disk C onto Disk E. (1 stage)
19. Stage s18 → s19: Move top Disk A from the Right peg onto Disk B. (1 stage)
20. Stage s19 → s20: Move top Disk C from on top of Disk D to the Right peg. (1 stage)
21. Stage s20 → s21: Move top Disk A from on top of Disk B onto Disk D. (1 stage)
22. Stage s21 → s22: Move top Disk B from on top of Disk E onto Disk C. (1 stage)
23. Stage s22 → s23: Move top Disk A from on top of Disk D onto Disk B. (1 stage)
24. Stage s23 → s24: Move top Disk D from the Middle peg onto Disk E. (1 stage)
25. Stage s24 → s25: Move top Disk A from on top of Disk B onto Disk D. (1 stage)
26. Stage s25 → s26: Move top Disk B from on top of Disk C to the Middle peg. (1 stage)
27. Stage s26 → s27: Move top Disk A from on top of Disk D onto Disk B. (1 stage)
28. Stage s27 → s28: Move top Disk C from the Right peg onto Disk D. (1 stage)
29. Stage s28 → s29: Move top Disk A from on top of Disk B to the Right peg. (1 stage)
30. Stage s29 → s30: Move top Disk B from the Middle peg onto Disk C. (1 stage)
31. Stage s30 → s31: Move top Disk A from the Right peg onto Disk B. (1 stage)

Final state (after stage s31)
- Left peg (top to bottom): Disk A, Disk B, Disk C, Disk D, Disk E — goal stack achieved.
- Middle peg: empty (clear).
- Right peg: empty (clear).
- Final timestamp: at-stage s31.

Notes: Each listed move is the primitive "move the top disk" action; every step takes exactly one stage (sN → sN+1). All moves in this sequence follow the Tower of Hanoi constraints: only the top disk is moved and a disk is always placed either on an empty peg or on a larger disk. The sequence exactly follows the provided PDDL plan (31 unit-cost moves).
