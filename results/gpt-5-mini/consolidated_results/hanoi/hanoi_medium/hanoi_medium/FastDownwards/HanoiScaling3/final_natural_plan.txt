Summary / conventions
- Disk names: d1 (smallest, A), d2 (B), d3 (C), d4 (D), d5 (largest, E).
- Peg names: b1 = left peg, b2 = middle peg, b3 = right peg.
- Preconditions for every move: the moved disk must be the top disk of its source (clear), the destination must be clear, and the moved disk must be smaller than the object it is placed on (no larger-on-smaller).
- Timing convention: each move is one time unit long. Start time 00:00:00. Step N runs [T, T+1s) where T = (N-1) seconds.

Final verification (00:00:31)
- Right peg b3 (right) now supports the stack (top to bottom): d1 on d2 on d3 on d4 on d5. Equivalent to the goal ordering A (d1), B (d2), C (d3), D (d4), E (d5) on b3.
- Left and middle pegs (b1, b2) are clear (empty).
- All moves obeyed the rules: single top-disk moves, one disk at a time, and never placing a larger disk on a smaller disk.
- Total moves: 31 (used s31 in the PDDL plan). Total elapsed time (by the timing convention): 31 seconds.
