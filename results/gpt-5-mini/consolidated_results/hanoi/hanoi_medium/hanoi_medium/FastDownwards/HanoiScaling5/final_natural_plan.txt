Plan summary: 31 ordered atomic moves to transfer the full stack from peg right to peg left (mid empty). Timestamps are illustrative (1 second per move).

1. [t=0s] move disk a from disk b to peg left
2. [t=1s] move disk b from disk c to peg mid
3. [t=2s] move disk a from peg left to disk b
4. [t=3s] move disk c from disk d to peg left
5. [t=4s] move disk a from disk b to disk d
6. [t=5s] move disk b from peg mid to disk c
7. [t=6s] move disk a from disk d to disk b
8. [t=7s] move disk d from disk e to peg mid
9. [t=8s] move disk a from disk b to disk d
