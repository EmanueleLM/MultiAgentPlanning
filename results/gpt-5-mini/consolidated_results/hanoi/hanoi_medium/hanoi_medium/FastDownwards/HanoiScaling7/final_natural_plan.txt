Below is a clear, human-readable, step-by-step trace of the provided PDDL plan. Each move matches exactly one action from the plan (no additions or deletions). I show the step index, the explicit stage transition (sX -> sY) from the plan, a short natural-language description of the move (disk and source/destination), and a timestamp/duration. Each move is 1 time unit; the plan starts at t = 0 and ends at t = 31 (31 moves, unit cost).

1) Step 1 — s0 -> s1 — t = 0.0 .. 1.0 (duration 1)
   Move disk A from on top of disk B (middle peg) to the right peg.

2) Step 2 — s1 -> s2 — t = 1.0 .. 2.0 (duration 1)
   Move disk B from on top of disk C (middle peg) to the left peg.

3) Step 3 — s2 -> s3 — t = 2.0 .. 3.0 (duration 1)
   Move disk A from the right peg onto disk B (which is on the left peg).

4) Step 4 — s3 -> s4 — t = 3.0 .. 4.0 (duration 1)
   Move disk C from on top of disk D (middle peg) to the right peg.

5) Step 5 — s4 -> s5 — t = 4.0 .. 5.0 (duration 1)
   Move disk A from on top of disk B (left peg) onto disk D (middle peg).

6) Step 6 — s5 -> s6 — t = 5.0 .. 6.0 (duration 1)
   Move disk B from the left peg onto disk C (right peg).

7) Step 7 — s6 -> s7 — t = 6.0 .. 7.0 (duration 1)
   Move disk A from disk D (middle/left) onto disk B (right).

8) Step 8 — s7 -> s8 — t = 7.0 .. 8.0 (duration 1)
   Move disk D from on top of disk E (middle peg) to the left peg.

9) Step 9 — s8 -> s9 — t = 8.0 .. 9.0 (duration 1)
   Move disk A from disk B (right) onto disk D (left).

10) Step 10 — s9 -> s10 — t = 9.0 .. 10.0 (duration 1)
    Move disk B from on top of disk C (right peg) onto disk E (middle peg).

11) Step 11 — s10 -> s11 — t = 10.0 .. 11.0 (duration 1)
    Move disk A from disk D (left) onto disk B (now on middle).

12) Step 12 — s11 -> s12 — t = 11.0 .. 12.0 (duration 1)
    Move disk C from the right peg onto disk D (left).

13) Step 13 — s12 -> s13 — t = 12.0 .. 13.0 (duration 1)
    Move disk A from disk B (middle) to the right peg.

14) Step 14 — s13 -> s14 — t = 13.0 .. 14.0 (duration 1)
    Move disk B from disk E (middle) onto disk C (left).

15) Step 15 — s14 -> s15 — t = 14.0 .. 15.0 (duration 1)
    Move disk A from the right peg onto disk B.

16) Step 16 — s15 -> s16 — t = 15.0 .. 16.0 (duration 1)
    Move disk E from the middle peg to the right peg.

17) Step 17 — s16 -> s17 — t = 16.0 .. 17.0 (duration 1)
    Move disk A from disk B onto the middle peg.

18) Step 18 — s17 -> s18 — t = 17.0 .. 18.0 (duration 1)
    Move disk B from disk C (left) onto disk E (right).

19) Step 19 — s18 -> s19 — t = 18.0 .. 19.0 (duration 1)
    Move disk A from the middle peg onto disk B.

20) Step 20 — s19 -> s20 — t = 19.0 .. 20.0 (duration 1)
    Move disk C from on top of disk D (left) to the middle peg.

21) Step 21 — s20 -> s21 — t = 20.0 .. 21.0 (duration 1)
    Move disk A from disk B onto disk D.

22) Step 22 — s21 -> s22 — t = 21.0 .. 22.0 (duration 1)
    Move disk B from disk E (right) onto disk C (middle/left stack).

23) Step 23 — s22 -> s23 — t = 22.0 .. 23.0 (duration 1)
    Move disk A from disk D onto disk B.

24) Step 24 — s23 -> s24 — t = 23.0 .. 24.0 (duration 1)
    Move disk D from the left peg onto disk E.

25) Step 25 — s24 -> s25 — t = 24.0 .. 25.0 (duration 1)
    Move disk A from disk B onto disk D.

26) Step 26 — s25 -> s26 — t = 25.0 .. 26.0 (duration 1)
    Move disk B from disk C (middle/left) to the left peg.

27) Step 27 — s26 -> s27 — t = 26.0 .. 27.0 (duration 1)
    Move disk A from disk D onto disk B.

28) Step 28 — s27 -> s28 — t = 27.0 .. 28.0 (duration 1)
    Move disk C from the middle peg onto disk D.

29) Step 29 — s28 -> s29 — t = 28.0 .. 29.0 (duration 1)
    Move disk A from disk B to the middle peg.

30) Step 30 — s29 -> s30 — t = 29.0 .. 30.0 (duration 1)
    Move disk B from the left peg onto disk C.

31) Step 31 — s30 -> s31 — t = 30.0 .. 31.0 (duration 1)
    Move disk A from the middle peg onto disk B.

End state at t = 31.0 (s31): right peg holds, from bottom to top, disk E, disk D, disk C, disk B, disk A; left and middle pegs are empty; top disk (A) is clear. Total duration (cost) = 31 time units, matching the plan cost = 31.
