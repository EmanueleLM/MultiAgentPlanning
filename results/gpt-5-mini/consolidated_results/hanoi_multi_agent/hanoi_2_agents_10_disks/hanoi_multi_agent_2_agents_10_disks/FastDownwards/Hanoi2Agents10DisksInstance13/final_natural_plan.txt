Sequence of actions (matching the given plan exactly). Each step shows a start timestamp and a 1.0 s duration.

1) Time 0.00 → 1.00 (duration 1.0s)
   agent_1 moves disk A from on disk B (left peg) to right peg.
   (corresponds to plan action: (agent1-move-to-peg a b right))

2) Time 1.00 → 2.00 (duration 1.0s)
   agent_1 moves disk B from on disk C (left peg) to middle peg.
   (corresponds to plan action: (agent1-move-to-peg b c middle))

3) Time 2.00 → 3.00 (duration 1.0s)
   agent_1 moves disk A from right peg onto disk B (now on middle peg).
   (corresponds to plan action: (agent1-move-to-disk a right b))

4) Time 3.00 → 4.00 (duration 1.0s)
   agent_1 moves disk C from on disk D (left peg) to right peg.
   (corresponds to plan action: (agent1-move-to-peg c d right))

5) Time 4.00 → 5.00 (duration 1.0s)
   agent_1 moves disk A from on disk B (middle peg) onto disk C (right peg).
   (corresponds to plan action: (agent1-move-to-disk a b c))

6) Time 5.00 → 6.00 (duration 1.0s)
   agent_1 moves disk B from middle peg onto disk D (left peg).
   (corresponds to plan action: (agent1-move-to-disk b middle d))

7) Time 6.00 → 7.00 (duration 1.0s)
   agent_1 moves disk A from on disk C (right peg) onto disk B (left peg).
   (corresponds to plan action: (agent1-move-to-disk a c b))

8) Time 7.00 → 8.00 (duration 1.0s)
   agent_1 moves disk C from right peg to middle peg.
   (corresponds to plan action: (agent1-move-to-peg c right middle))

Total plan cost: 8 (8 unit moves).  
These moves respect the Tower of Hanoi rules and only involve agent_1's disks (A–E). The final configuration after step 8 meets the specified goal: left peg top→bottom A, B, D, E, F, G, H, I, J; middle peg has C on top and is clear; right peg empty.
