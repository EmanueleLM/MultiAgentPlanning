Planned execution (each primitive move duration = 1.0 time unit):

1) t = 0.0 → 1.0
   agent_1: move disk A from on top of disk B to peg middle.

2) t = 1.0 → 2.0
   agent_1: move disk B from on top of disk C to peg right.

3) t = 2.0 → 3.0
   agent_1: move disk A from peg middle to on top of disk B.

4) t = 3.0 → 4.0
   agent_1: move disk C from on top of disk D to peg middle.

5) t = 4.0 → 5.0
   agent_1: move disk A from on top of disk B to on top of disk C.

6) t = 5.0 → 6.0
   agent_1: move disk A from on top of disk C to on top of disk D.

7) t = 6.0 → 7.0
   agent_1: move disk B from peg right to on top of disk C.

8) t = 7.0 → 8.0
   agent_1: move disk A from on top of disk D to on top of disk B.

9) t = 8.0 → 9.0
   agent_1: move disk D from on top of disk E to peg right.

10) t = 9.0 → 10.0
    agent_1: move disk A from on top of disk B to on top of disk D.

11) t = 10.0 → 11.0
    agent_1: move disk B from on top of disk C to on top of disk E.

12) t = 11.0 → 12.0
    agent_1: move disk A from on top of disk D to on top of disk B.

13) t = 12.0 → 13.0
    agent_1: move disk C from peg middle to on top of disk D.

14) t = 13.0 → 14.0
    agent_1: move disk A from on top of disk B to on top of disk C.

15) t = 14.0 → 15.0
    agent_1: move disk B from on top of disk E to peg middle.

16) t = 15.0 → 16.0
    agent_1: move disk A from on top of disk C to on top of disk B.

17) t = 16.0 → 17.0
    agent_1: move disk C from on top of disk D to on top of disk E.

Total cost/time: 17 unit moves (total duration 17.0 time units).

Result: after these 17 moves the final configuration matches the specified goal:
- left peg (top → bottom): C, E, F, G, H, I, J
- middle peg (top → bottom): A, B
- right peg (top → bottom): D
