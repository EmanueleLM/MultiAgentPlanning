Summary: the following is the exact sequence of 40 primitive moves from the provided plan. Each step is reported in the required primitive format and includes an estimated timestamp (start 00:00:00, each move assumed 5s). Parenthetical notes indicate when a move places a disk onto a specific disk (these notes reflect the action type in the original plan). All moves are by agent_1 and move only disks A–E, as required.
