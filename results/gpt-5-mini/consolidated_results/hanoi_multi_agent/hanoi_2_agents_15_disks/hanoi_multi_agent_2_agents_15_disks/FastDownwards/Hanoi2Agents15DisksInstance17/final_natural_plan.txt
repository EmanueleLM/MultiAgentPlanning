Assumptions (minimal):
- Each primitive move is atomic and takes approximately 1 second (timestamps below are illustrative).
- Timestamps start at 00:00:00 and increment by 1 second per move for readability; they do not affect legality of moves.

Final ordered list of primitive moves (exact required format):
agent_1: move disk A from left to middle
agent_1: move disk B from left to right
agent_1: move disk A from middle to right
agent_1: move disk C from left to middle
agent_1: move disk A from right to left
agent_1: move disk B from right to middle
agent_1: move disk A from left to middle
agent_1: move disk D from left to right
agent_1: move disk A from middle to right
agent_1: move disk B from middle to left
agent_1: move disk A from right to left
agent_1: move disk C from middle to right
agent_1: move disk A from left to middle
agent_1: move disk B from left to right
agent_1: move disk A from middle to right
agent_1: move disk E from left to middle
agent_1: move disk A from right to left
agent_1: move disk B from right to middle
agent_1: move disk A from left to middle
agent_1: move disk C from right to left
agent_1: move disk A from middle to right
agent_1: move disk B from middle to left
agent_1: move disk A from right to left
agent_1: move disk D from right to middle
agent_1: move disk A from left to right
agent_1: move disk B from left to middle
agent_1: move disk A from right to middle
agent_1: move disk C from left to right

This sequence matches the provided PDDL plan exactly (28 unit-cost moves), respects agent_1's disk permissions (A–H) and the Tower of Hanoi rules, and achieves the specified goal configuration when combined with the unchanged positions of disks I–O.
