Timestamp format: HH:MM:SS. Each move assumed to take 1s (sequential execution).

1) [00:00:00 - 00:00:01] agent_1: move disk A from left to right
   (Executed as: move disk A from on top of disk B (left peg) to the empty right peg.)

2) [00:00:01 - 00:00:02] agent_1: move disk B from left to middle
   (Executed as: move disk B from on top of disk C (left peg) to the empty middle peg.)

3) [00:00:02 - 00:00:03] agent_1: move disk A from right to middle
   (Executed as: move disk A from the right peg onto disk B (now on the middle peg).)

4) [00:00:03 - 00:00:04] agent_1: move disk C from left to right
   (Executed as: move disk C from on top of disk D (left peg) to the empty right peg.)

5) [00:00:04 - 00:00:05] agent_1: move disk A from middle to left
   (Executed as: move disk A from on top of disk B (middle peg) onto disk D (left peg).)

6) [00:00:05 - 00:00:06] agent_1: move disk B from middle to right
   (Executed as: move disk B from the middle peg onto disk C (right peg).)

7) [00:00:06 - 00:00:07] agent_1: move disk A from left to right
   (Executed as: move disk A from on top of disk D (left peg) onto disk B (right peg).)

Total cost: 7 (unit cost). 

Resulting configuration after these moves (top → bottom):
- right peg: A, B, C
- middle peg: empty
- left peg: D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, O

This sequence exactly matches the provided PDDL plan (7 actions) and respects the agent movement restrictions and Tower of Hanoi stacking rules.
