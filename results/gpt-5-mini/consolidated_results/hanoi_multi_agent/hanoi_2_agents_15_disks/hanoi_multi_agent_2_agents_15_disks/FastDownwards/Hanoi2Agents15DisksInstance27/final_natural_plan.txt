Below are the 22 steps exactly matching the given plan. I report a simple timestamp assuming each move takes 1 second (start at 00:00:00). Each step states the agent, the disk moved, and the origin and destination as expressed by the plan.

1. [00:00:00 → 00:00:01] agent_1: move disk A from on top of disk B to peg middle.
2. [00:00:01 → 00:00:02] agent_1: move disk B from on top of disk C to peg right.
3. [00:00:02 → 00:00:03] agent_1: move disk A from peg middle to on top of disk B.
4. [00:00:03 → 00:00:04] agent_1: move disk C from on top of disk D to peg middle.
5. [00:00:04 → 00:00:05] agent_1: move disk A from on top of disk B to on top of disk D.
6. [00:00:05 → 00:00:06] agent_1: move disk B from peg right to on top of disk C.
7. [00:00:06 → 00:00:07] agent_1: move disk A from on top of disk D to on top of disk B.
8. [00:00:07 → 00:00:08] agent_1: move disk D from on top of disk E to peg right.
9. [00:00:08 → 00:00:09] agent_1: move disk A from on top of disk B to on top of disk E.
10. [00:00:09 → 00:00:10] agent_1: move disk B from on top of disk C to on top of disk D.
11. [00:00:10 → 00:00:11] agent_1: move disk A from on top of disk E to on top of disk C.
12. [00:00:11 → 00:00:12] agent_1: move disk B from on top of disk D to on top of disk E.
13. [00:00:12 → 00:00:13] agent_1: move disk A from on top of disk C to on top of disk B.
14. [00:00:13 → 00:00:14] agent_1: move disk C from peg middle to on top of disk D.
15. [00:00:14 → 00:00:15] agent_1: move disk A from on top of disk B to peg middle.
16. [00:00:15 → 00:00:16] agent_1: move disk B from on top of disk E to on top of disk C.
17. [00:00:16 → 00:00:17] agent_1: move disk A from peg middle to on top of disk B.
18. [00:00:17 → 00:00:18] agent_1: move disk E from on top of disk F to peg middle.
19. [00:00:18 → 00:00:19] agent_1: move disk A from on top of disk B to on top of disk F.
20. [00:00:19 → 00:00:20] agent_1: move disk A from on top of disk F to on top of disk E.
21. [00:00:20 → 00:00:21] agent_1: move disk B from on top of disk C to on top of disk F.
22. [00:00:21 → 00:00:22] agent_1: move disk A from on top of disk E to on top of disk B.

Total actions: 22 (unit cost plan). These steps follow the provided plan exactly and obey the Tower of Hanoi constraints and the agent permission (only agent_1 moves disks A–H).
