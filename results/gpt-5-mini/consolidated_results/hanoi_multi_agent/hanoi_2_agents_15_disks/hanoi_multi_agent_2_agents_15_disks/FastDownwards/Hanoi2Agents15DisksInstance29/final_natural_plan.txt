1. [t=0s → dur 1s] agent_1: move disk A from B to pegM
   - Move A (top disk) off B on the left peg and place it on the middle peg (pegM).

2. [t=1s → dur 1s] agent_1: move disk B from C to pegR
   - Move B (now top on the left peg) from on C to the right peg (pegR).

3. [t=2s → dur 1s] agent_1: move disk A from pegM to C
   - Move A from the middle peg (pegM) and place it on top of disk C (left peg).

4. [t=3s → dur 1s] agent_1: move disk B from pegR to pegM
   - Move B from the right peg (pegR) to the middle peg (pegM).

5. [t=4s → dur 1s] agent_1: move disk A from C to B
   - Move A from disk C and place it on top of disk B.

6. [t=5s → dur 1s] agent_1: move disk C from D to pegR
   - Move C (now exposed) from on D (left peg) to the right peg (pegR).

7. [t=6s → dur 1s] agent_1: move disk A from B to C
   - Move A from on B and place it on top of disk C.

8. [t=7s → dur 1s] agent_1: move disk B from pegM to D
   - Move B from the middle peg (pegM) and place it on top of disk D.

Total cost: 8 (unit cost).  
This sequence follows the Tower of Hanoi rules and uses only agent_1's permitted disks (A–H). Executing these eight moves yields the specified goal stacks (left peg and right peg) with the middle peg empty.
