Execution log (matches the provided plan exactly). Each step lists agent, disk, source peg, destination peg, start time and duration (assumed 10s per move for readability).

1) [00:00:00 → 00:00:10] agent_1: move disk A from left to middle.
2) [00:00:10 → 00:00:20] agent_1: move disk B from left to right.
3) [00:00:20 → 00:00:30] agent_1: move disk A from middle to left.
4) [00:00:30 → 00:00:40] agent_1: move disk B from right to middle.
5) [00:00:40 → 00:00:50] agent_1: move disk A from left to middle.
6) [00:00:50 → 00:01:00] agent_1: move disk C from left to right.
7) [00:01:00 → 00:01:10] agent_1: move disk A from middle to left.
8) [00:01:10 → 00:01:20] agent_1: move disk B from middle to right.
9) [00:01:20 → 00:01:30] agent_1: move disk A from left to right.
10) [00:01:30 → 00:01:40] agent_1: move disk D from left to middle.
11) [00:01:40 → 00:01:50] agent_1: move disk A from right to left.

Outcome: after these 11 moves (total assumed execution time 110s), the small-disk portion of the configuration matches the goal:

- Left peg (top→bottom): A E F G H I J K L M N O P Q R S T
- Middle peg: D
- Right peg (top→bottom): B C
