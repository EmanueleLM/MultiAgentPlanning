Below is a human-readable, step-by-step execution of the provided plan. Each step matches one action in the plan exactly, lists the performing agent (agent_1), describes the disk moved and the source/destination, and includes a timestamp (1 second per step). All moves respect the Tower of Hanoi rules and agent_1's disk permissions (A–J). Total cost = 15 (unit cost).

1. Time 0s — agent_1: move disk A from disk B to middle peg.
2. Time 1s — agent_1: move disk B from disk C to right peg.
3. Time 2s — agent_1: move disk A from middle peg to disk B.
4. Time 3s — agent_1: move disk C from disk D to middle peg.
5. Time 4s — agent_1: move disk A from disk B to disk D.
6. Time 5s — agent_1: move disk B from right peg to disk C.
7. Time 6s — agent_1: move disk A from disk D to disk B.
8. Time 7s — agent_1: move disk D from disk E to right peg.
9. Time 8s — agent_1: move disk A from disk B to disk E.
10. Time 9s — agent_1: move disk B from disk C to disk D.
11. Time 10s — agent_1: move disk A from disk E to disk B.
12. Time 11s — agent_1: move disk C from middle peg to disk E.
13. Time 12s — agent_1: move disk A from disk B to middle peg.
14. Time 13s — agent_1: move disk B from disk D to disk C.
15. Time 14s — agent_1: move disk A from middle peg to disk D.

Final note: total execution time (as listed) = 15s (one unit per action), total cost = 15. The sequence achieves the specified goal configuration (left peg top-to-bottom: B C E F G H I J K L M N O P Q R S T; right peg top-to-bottom: A D; middle peg empty), and every move was performed by agent_1 on disks A–J as permitted.
