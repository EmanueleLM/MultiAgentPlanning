Summary plan (each step follows the provided PDDL plan exactly). Timestamps and durations are approximate and shown where possible.

Step 1 — time 00:00:00 → 00:00:01 (duration 1s)
agent_1: move disk A from left to middle

Step 2 — time 00:00:01 → 00:00:02 (duration 1s)
agent_1: move disk A from middle to right

Step 3 — time 00:00:02 → 00:00:03 (duration 1s)
agent_1: move disk B from left to middle

Total cost: 3 (unit cost)

Result: After these three moves the configuration matches the goal — left peg top is C (with C..T below), middle peg top is B, and right peg top is A.
