Summary: the following 13 ordered primitive actions are exactly the plan steps executed by agent_1. Each line shows a timestamp (1s per move), the agent, the disk moved and source→destination, and a short note about the destination/source state when useful. This sequence matches the provided PDDL plan exactly and achieves the specified goal.

1) [00:00:00, duration 1s] agent_1: move disk A from left to right.
   - Destination (right) was empty. After the move, top of left becomes B.

2) [00:00:01, duration 1s] agent_1: move disk B from left to middle.
   - Destination (middle) was empty. After the move, top of left becomes C.

3) [00:00:02, duration 1s] agent_1: move disk A from right to middle.
   - A is placed onto B at middle (B was top at middle). After the move, right becomes empty.

4) [00:00:03, duration 1s] agent_1: move disk C from left to right.
   - Destination (right) was empty. After the move, top of left becomes D.

5) [00:00:04, duration 1s] agent_1: move disk A from middle to left.
   - A is placed onto D at left (D was top at left).

6) [00:00:05, duration 1s] agent_1: move disk B from middle to right.
   - B is placed onto C at right (C was top at right). After the move, middle becomes empty.

7) [00:00:06, duration 1s] agent_1: move disk A from left to right.
   - A is placed onto B at right (B was top at right). After the move, top of left becomes D.

8) [00:00:07, duration 1s] agent_1: move disk D from left to middle.
   - Destination (middle) was empty. After the move, top of left becomes E.

9) [00:00:08, duration 1s] agent_1: move disk A from right to middle.
   - A is placed onto D at middle (D was top at middle). After the move, top of right becomes B.

10) [00:00:09, duration 1s] agent_1: move disk B from right to left.
    - B is placed onto E at left (E was top at left). After the move, right becomes empty.

11) [00:00:10, duration 1s] agent_1: move disk A from middle to left.
    - A is placed onto B at left (B was top at left). After the move, top of middle becomes D.

12) [00:00:11, duration 1s] agent_1: move disk C from right to middle.
    - C is placed onto D at middle (D was top at middle). After the move, right becomes empty.

13) [00:00:12, duration 1s] agent_1: move disk A from left to right.
    - Destination (right) was empty. After the move, top of left becomes B.

Result: all 13 planned primitive moves executed in order (total cost = 13). The final configuration matches the specified public goal:
- Left peg (top→bottom): B, E, F, G, H, I, J (top B)
- Middle peg (top→bottom): C, D (top C)
- Right peg (top): A

All moves respect agent_1's restriction (agent_1 moved only disks A, B, C, D) and the Tower of Hanoi rules.
