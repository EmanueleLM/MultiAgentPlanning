Human-readable sequence (with timestamps, 5-second duration per move):

1) [00:00:00 → 00:00:05] agent_1: move disk A from left to right
2) [00:00:05 → 00:00:10] agent_1: move disk B from left to middle
3) [00:00:10 → 00:00:15] agent_1: move disk A from right to middle
4) [00:00:15 → 00:00:20] agent_1: move disk C from left to right
5) [00:00:20 → 00:00:25] agent_1: move disk A from middle to left

Ordered list of primitive moves (exact required format, one per line):

agent_1: move disk A from left to right
agent_1: move disk B from left to middle
agent_1: move disk A from right to middle
agent_1: move disk C from left to right
agent_1: move disk A from middle to left
