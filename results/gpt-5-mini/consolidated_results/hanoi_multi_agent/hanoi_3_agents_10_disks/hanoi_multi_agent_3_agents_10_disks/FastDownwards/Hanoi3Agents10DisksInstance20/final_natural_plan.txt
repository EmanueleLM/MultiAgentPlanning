Plan (16 steps). Timestamps are approximate, 5s per move:

1) [00:00:00] agent_1: move disk A from on top of disk B to peg middle.
2) [00:00:05] agent_1: move disk B from on top of disk C to peg right.
3) [00:00:10] agent_1: move disk A from peg middle onto disk C.
4) [00:00:15] agent_1: move disk A from on top of disk C onto disk B.
5) [00:00:20] agent_1: move disk C from on top of disk D to peg middle.
6) [00:00:25] agent_1: move disk A from on top of disk B onto disk C.
7) [00:00:30] agent_1: move disk B from peg right onto disk D.
8) [00:00:35] agent_1: move disk A from on top of disk C onto disk B.
9) [00:00:40] agent_1: move disk C from peg middle to peg right.
10) [00:00:45] agent_1: move disk A from on top of disk B to peg middle.
11) [00:00:50] agent_1: move disk B from on top of disk D onto disk C.
12) [00:00:55] agent_1: move disk A from peg middle onto disk B.
13) [00:01:00] agent_1: move disk D from on top of disk E to peg middle.
14) [00:01:05] agent_1: move disk A from on top of disk B onto disk E.
15) [00:01:10] agent_1: move disk B from on top of disk C onto disk D.
16) [00:01:15] agent_1: move disk A from on top of disk E onto disk C.

Total cost = 16 (unit cost per move).
