Here are the human-readable steps that exactly follow the given PDDL plan. Each step shows an approximate timestamp (1 s per move) and a short description of the move and the local stack effect.

Initial configuration (t=00:00:00)
- Left peg (top→bottom): A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J
- Middle peg: (empty)
- Right peg: (empty)

Step 1 — t=00:00:00 → 00:00:01
- Action: agent_1: move disk A from left to right
- Description: Move top disk A (which sits on B on the left peg) to the empty right peg.
- Resulting stacks:
  - Left: B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J
  - Middle: (empty)
  - Right: A

Step 2 — t=00:00:01 → 00:00:02
- Action: agent_1: move disk B from left to middle
- Description: Move top disk B (which sits on C on the left peg) to the empty middle peg.
- Resulting stacks:
  - Left: C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J
  - Middle: B
  - Right: A

Step 3 — t=00:00:02 → 00:00:03
- Action: agent_1: move disk A from right to middle (onto B)
- Description: Move disk A from the right peg onto disk B on the middle peg (A is smaller than B).
- Resulting stacks:
  - Left: C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J
  - Middle: A, B
  - Right: (empty)

Step 4 — t=00:00:03 → 00:00:04
- Action: agent_1: move disk C from left to right
- Description: Move top disk C (which sits on D on the left peg) to the empty right peg.
- Resulting stacks:
  - Left: D, E, F, G, H, I, J
  - Middle: A, B
  - Right: C

Step 5 — t=00:00:04 → 00:00:05
- Action: agent_1: move disk A from middle to left (onto D)
- Description: Move disk A from atop B on the middle peg to sit on top of disk D on the left peg (A is smaller than D).
- Resulting stacks:
  - Left: A, D, E, F, G, H, I, J
  - Middle: B
  - Right: C

Step 6 — t=00:00:05 → 00:00:06
- Action: agent_1: move disk A from left to right (onto C)
- Description: Move disk A from the left peg (on D) onto disk C on the right peg (A is smaller than C).
- Resulting stacks:
  - Left: D, E, F, G, H, I, J
  - Middle: B
  - Right: A, C

Step 7 — t=00:00:06 → 00:00:07
- Action: agent_1: move disk B from middle to left (onto D)
- Description: Move disk B from the middle peg to sit on top of disk D on the left peg (B is smaller than D).
- Resulting stacks:
  - Left: B, D, E, F, G, H, I, J
  - Middle: (empty)
  - Right: A, C

Step 8 — t=00:00:07 → 00:00:08
- Action: agent_1: move disk A from right to left (onto B)
- Description: Move disk A from the right peg (on C) onto disk B on the left peg (A is smaller than B).
- Resulting stacks:
  - Left: A, B, D, E, F, G, H, I, J
  - Middle: (empty)
  - Right: C

Step 9 — t=00:00:08 → 00:00:09
- Action: agent_1: move disk C from right to middle
- Description: Move disk C from the right peg to the empty middle peg.
- Resulting stacks (final):
  - Left (top→bottom): A, B, D, E, F, G, H, I, J
  - Middle: C
  - Right: (empty)

Goal achieved at t=00:00:09 — final configuration matches the specified goal.
