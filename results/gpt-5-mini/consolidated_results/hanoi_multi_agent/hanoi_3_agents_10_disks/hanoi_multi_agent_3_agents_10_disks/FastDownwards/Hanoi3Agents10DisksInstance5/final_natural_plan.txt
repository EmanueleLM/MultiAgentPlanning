Planned primitive moves (sequential, each move assumed duration = 1.0 time unit):

1) [t=0.0 → t=1.0] agent_1: move disk A from left to middle
2) [t=1.0 → t=2.0] agent_1: move disk B from left to right
3) [t=2.0 → t=3.0] agent_1: move disk A from middle to right
4) [t=3.0 → t=4.0] agent_1: move disk C from left to middle

Total cost = 4 (4 moves, unit cost each).

Resulting configuration after these steps matches the goal:
- left peg top-to-bottom: D E F G H I J
- middle peg: C
- right peg top-to-bottom: A B

(These four actions exactly match the provided plan and use only agent_1 moves as specified.)
