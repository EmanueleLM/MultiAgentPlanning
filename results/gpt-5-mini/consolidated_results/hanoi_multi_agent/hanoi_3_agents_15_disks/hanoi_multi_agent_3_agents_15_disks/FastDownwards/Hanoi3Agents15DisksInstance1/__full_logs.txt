PROBLEM
------------------------------
Devise a cooperative plan for a 3-agent Tower of Hanoi with 15 disks labelled A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, O (A is the smallest, O the largest). Agents are limited to moving specific disks: agent_1 ⇒ A, B, C, D, E; agent_2 ⇒ F, G, H, I, J; agent_3 ⇒ K, L, M, N, O. Initial configuration: left peg has (top→bottom) A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, O; middle peg is empty; right peg is empty. Goal configuration: left peg has (top→bottom) C, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, O; middle peg has (top→bottom) B; right peg has (top→bottom) A, D. Provide an ordered list of primitive moves in the format 'agent_i: move disk X from peg1 to peg2', respecting the agent restrictions and the Tower of Hanoi rules.

ENVIRONMENT
------------------------------
Devise a cooperative plan for a 3-agent Tower of Hanoi with 15 disks labelled A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, O (A is the smallest, O the largest). Agents are limited to moving specific disks: agent_1 ⇒ A, B, C, D, E; agent_2 ⇒ F, G, H, I, J; agent_3 ⇒ K, L, M, N, O.

Goal configuration: left peg has (top→bottom) C, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, O; middle peg has (top→bottom) B; right peg has (top→bottom) A, D. Provide an ordered list of primitive moves in the format 'agent_i: move disk X from peg1 to peg2', respecting the agent restrictions and the Tower of Hanoi rules.
================================================================================


FINAL-PLAN
------------------------------
I don't yet have the agents' proposed move lists or the public initial/goal configuration. I can't produce a correct merged plan or the PDDL files without those inputs.

Please provide the following (exact values and ordered move lists):

1) Public problem specification
- Number of disks and their names (e.g., d1 d2 d3 where d1 is smallest).
- Peg names (e.g., A B C).
- Initial configuration: for each peg, the stack order top-to-bottom (or an explicit list of disk-on-disk and disk-on-peg facts).
- Goal configuration in the same format (final stacks).

2) For each agent (agent_1, agent_2, agent_3) supply:
- The agent’s allowed-move permissions: which disk moves the agent is allowed to perform (e.g., agent_1 may move d1 and d3; agent_2 may move d2 only).
- The agent’s proposed ordered list of primitive moves (each move as a triple: move <disk> from <pegX> to <pegY>), in the order the agent proposes them. Example move: "move d1 A B".
- If the agent has preferences that should be treated as hard constraints, state them explicitly (for example: "agent_1 must perform its moves before agent_2" — note: you said treat such preferences as strict/temporal constraints).

3) Any additional constraints (e.g., peg capacity limits beyond standard Tower of Hanoi rules, or forbidden peg pairs).

Guidelines / example format you can copy/paste and fill in:

- Disks: d1 d2 d3
- Pegs: A B C
- Initial:
  A: d3 d2 d1   (top is leftmost or specify)
  B: 
  C:
- Goal:
  C: d3 d2 d1

- agent_1:
  allowed-disks: d1 d3
  proposed-moves (in order):
    1) move d1 A B
    2) move d3 A C
  preferences (as hard constraints): agent_1 moves must happen before agent_3

- agent_2:
  allowed-disks: d2
  proposed-moves:
    1) move d2 A C
  preferences: none

- agent_3:
  allowed-disks: d1
  proposed-moves:
    1) move d1 B C
  preferences: none

Once you provide the above, I will:
- Merge and, if necessary, reorder or add legally required moves so the full sequence is a valid Tower of Hanoi plan that respects each agent’s disk permissions and any stated ordering constraints.
- Produce a complete PDDL domain and a PDDL problem file (FastDownward-compatible) with agent-specific move capabilities encoded (agent predicates and separate agent move actions), only using :requirements :strips, :typing, and :negative-preconditions (and :action-costs only if you request cost reporting).
- Wrap the domain in <domain>...</domain> and the problem in <problem>...</problem>.

Please provide the missing details and I’ll generate the PDDL files.

NATURAL-PLAN sas_plan_1
------------------------------
Below is a clear, step-by-step human-readable rendering of the provided PDDL plan. Each step corresponds exactly to one action in the plan (no actions added or removed). I show a simple timestamp (start → end) and a 1s duration for each move where possible. Disk labels are shown as in the PDDL problem (A..E) and agent names match the plan (agent_1).

Summary: 19 moves, total cost = 19, total duration = 19s. Final goal configuration achieved as specified.

1. Time 00:00:00 → 00:00:01 (duration 1s)
   agent_1: move disk A from on top of disk B to peg right.
   (PDDL: (move-disk-disk-to-peg agent_1 a b right))

2. Time 00:00:01 → 00:00:02 (duration 1s)
   agent_1: move disk B from on top of disk C to peg middle.
   (PDDL: (move-disk-disk-to-peg agent_1 b c middle))

3. Time 00:00:02 → 00:00:03 (duration 1s)
   agent_1: move disk A from peg right onto disk B.
   (PDDL: (move-disk-peg-to-disk agent_1 a right b))

4. Time 00:00:03 → 00:00:04 (duration 1s)
   agent_1: move disk C from on top of disk D to peg right.
   (PDDL: (move-disk-disk-to-peg agent_1 c d right))

5. Time 00:00:04 → 00:00:05 (duration 1s)
   agent_1: move disk A from on top of disk B onto disk D.
   (PDDL: (move-disk-disk-to-disk agent_1 a b d))

6. Time 00:00:05 → 00:00:06 (duration 1s)
   agent_1: move disk B from peg middle onto disk C.
   (PDDL: (move-disk-peg-to-disk agent_1 b middle c))

7. Time 00:00:06 → 00:00:07 (duration 1s)
   agent_1: move disk A from on top of disk D onto disk B.
   (PDDL: (move-disk-disk-to-disk agent_1 a d b))

8. Time 00:00:07 → 00:00:08 (duration 1s)
   agent_1: move disk D from on top of disk E to peg middle.
   (PDDL: (move-disk-disk-to-peg agent_1 d e middle))

9. Time 00:00:08 → 00:00:09 (duration 1s)
   agent_1: move disk A from on top of disk B onto disk E.
   (PDDL: (move-disk-disk-to-disk agent_1 a b e))

10. Time 00:00:09 → 00:00:10 (duration 1s)
    agent_1: move disk B from on top of disk C onto disk D.
    (PDDL: (move-disk-disk-to-disk agent_1 b c d))

11. Time 00:00:10 → 00:00:11 (duration 1s)
    agent_1: move disk A from on top of disk E onto disk B.
    (PDDL: (move-disk-disk-to-disk agent_1 a e b))

12. Time 00:00:11 → 00:00:12 (duration 1s)
    agent_1: move disk C from peg right onto disk E.
    (PDDL: (move-disk-peg-to-disk agent_1 c right e))

13. Time 00:00:12 → 00:00:13 (duration 1s)
    agent_1: move disk A from on top of disk B to peg right.
    (PDDL: (move-disk-disk-to-peg agent_1 a b right))

14. Time 00:00:13 → 00:00:14 (duration 1s)
    agent_1: move disk B from on top of disk D onto disk C.
    (PDDL: (move-disk-disk-to-disk agent_1 b d c))

15. Time 00:00:14 → 00:00:15 (duration 1s)
    agent_1: move disk A from peg right onto disk D.
    (PDDL: (move-disk-peg-to-disk agent_1 a right d))

16. Time 00:00:15 → 00:00:16 (duration 1s)
    agent_1: move disk A from on top of disk D onto disk B.
    (PDDL: (move-disk-disk-to-disk agent_1 a d b))

17. Time 00:00:16 → 00:00:17 (duration 1s)
    agent_1: move disk D from peg middle to peg right.
    (PDDL: (move-disk-peg-to-peg agent_1 d middle right))

18. Time 00:00:17 → 00:00:18 (duration 1s)
    agent_1: move disk A from on top of disk B onto disk D.
    (PDDL: (move-disk-disk-to-disk agent_1 a b d))

19. Time 00:00:18 → 00:00:19 (duration 1s)
    agent_1: move disk B from on top of disk C to peg middle.
    (PDDL: (move-disk-disk-to-peg agent_1 b c middle))

Final status (after 00:00:19)
- All 19 plan steps executed in order by agent_1 (only disks A–E were moved, in accordance with the agents' permissions).
- Plan cost = 19 (unit cost). The final configuration matches the goal predicates specified in the PDDL problem (left: top->bottom C, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, O with O on peg left; middle contains B (clear); right contains A on D with A clear).

PROBLEM
------------------------------
Devise a cooperative plan for a 3-agent Tower of Hanoi with 15 disks labelled A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, O (A is the smallest, O the largest). Agents are limited to moving specific disks: agent_1 ⇒ A, B, C, D, E; agent_2 ⇒ F, G, H, I, J; agent_3 ⇒ K, L, M, N, O. Initial configuration: left peg has (top→bottom) A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, O; middle peg is empty; right peg is empty. Goal configuration: left peg has (top→bottom) C, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, O; middle peg has (top→bottom) A, E; right peg has (top→bottom) B, D. Provide an ordered list of primitive moves in the format 'agent_i: move disk X from peg1 to peg2', respecting the agent restrictions and the Tower of Hanoi rules.

================================================================================


FINAL-PLAN
------------------------------
I don't yet have the three agents' ordered move lists (agent_1, agent_2, agent_3) or their capability/permission details from you. I need those to validate and integrate their partial plans and produce the PDDL domain + problem and the final integrated move list.

Please provide the following (copy/paste or attach as plain text):

1) Three ordered lists of primitive moves, in the same textual format used by the agents. Example formats I can accept (pick one and be consistent):
   - agent_1:
     1. move A left middle
     2. move B left right
     ...
   - OR a compact single-line format:
     agent_1: move(A,left,middle); move(B,left,right); ...
   - OR a sequence of triples per line:
     agent_1
     move A from left to middle
     move B from left to right
     ...
   (I only need the disk identifier, source peg, and destination peg for each primitive move, in order.)

2) The agent permission/capability descriptions if they weren't included in the lists (for example: "agent_1 may move only disks A–G", "agent_2 may move only between left and middle pegs", "agent_3 is not allowed to move disk A", etc.). If the lists already imply permissions, just confirm that those are authoritative.

3) The initial configuration of all disks (which disk is on which peg and the ordering top-to-bottom). If you do not provide an initial configuration, I will ask for it (I cannot assume it).

Notes about what I'll produce once you provide the above:
- I will validate each agent move for legality (must move only top disk of its source peg, cannot place larger disk on smaller disk) and for permission constraints. If I find illegality or ambiguity I will minimally resolve it (documenting the resolution as comments in the PDDL problem) while preserving as much of the agents' sequences as possible.
- I will produce a FastDownward-compatible PDDL domain and a PDDL problem enclosed exactly as you requested:
  <domain>...</domain>
  <problem>...</problem>
  - :requirements will be limited to :strips, :typing, :negative-preconditions (and :action-costs only if I need to encode costs; I will avoid it unless necessary).
  - Each agent will have distinct action names (e.g., move-agent1, move-agent2, move-agent3) and agent permissions will be encoded as preconditions.
- I will append the final ordered list of primitive moves (the integrated, validated plan) as a comment inside the PDDL problem section.

Please paste the three move lists and any permission/initial-state info now.
