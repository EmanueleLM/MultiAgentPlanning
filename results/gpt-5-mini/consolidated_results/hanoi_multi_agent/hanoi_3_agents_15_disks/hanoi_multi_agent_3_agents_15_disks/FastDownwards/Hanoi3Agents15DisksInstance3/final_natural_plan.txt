Step 1 (t=0.0, duration = 1 unit, cost = 1):
- agent_1: move disk A from left to right
  - Pre-move: Disk A is the top disk on the left peg (sitting on disk B). The right peg is empty.
  - Post-move: Disk A is on the right peg (top). The left peg now has disks (top->bottom) B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, O. Middle peg remains empty.

This single action matches the provided plan and achieves the specified goal (A on right peg; B–O remaining in order on left; middle empty).
