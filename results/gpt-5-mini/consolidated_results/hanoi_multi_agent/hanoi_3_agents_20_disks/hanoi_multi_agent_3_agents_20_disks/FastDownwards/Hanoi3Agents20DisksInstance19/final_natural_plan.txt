Step 1 — t = 0.0s (duration ≈ 1.0s)
- agent_1: move disk A from the left peg (A was on top of disk B) to the middle peg.

Step 2 — t = 1.0s (duration ≈ 1.0s)
- agent_1: move disk B from the left peg (now top) to the right peg.

Step 3 — t = 2.0s (duration ≈ 1.0s)
- agent_1: move disk A from the middle peg onto disk B on the right peg.

Total cost / total duration: 3 units (≈ 3.0s).

Final configuration (matches the specified goal):
- Left peg, top→bottom: C D E F G H I J K L M N O P Q R S T
- Middle peg: empty
- Right peg, top→bottom: A B

(Notes: timestamps/durations are illustrative — each primitive move is one unit of cost as in the provided plan. No actions were added or removed.)
