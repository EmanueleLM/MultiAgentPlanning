1) Time 0.000s → 1.000s (duration 1.0s)
agent_1: move disk A from B to middle
(Explanation: move A off disk B on the left peg and place it onto the middle peg.)

2) Time 1.000s → 2.000s (duration 1.0s)
agent_1: move disk B from C to right
(Explanation: move B (now clear) from on top of C and place it onto the right peg.)

3) Time 2.000s → 3.000s (duration 1.0s)
agent_1: move disk A from middle to B
(Explanation: move A from the middle peg and place it on top of disk B on the right peg.)

4) Time 3.000s → 4.000s (duration 1.0s)
agent_1: move disk C from D to middle
(Explanation: move C from on top of D and place it onto the middle peg.)

5) Time 4.000s → 5.000s (duration 1.0s)
agent_1: move disk A from B to D
(Explanation: move A from on top of B (right peg) and place it onto disk D (left peg), which is clear.)

6) Time 5.000s → 6.000s (duration 1.0s)
agent_1: move disk B from right to C
(Explanation: move B from the right peg and place it on top of disk C (which is on the middle peg).)

7) Time 6.000s → 7.000s (duration 1.0s)
agent_1: move disk A from D to B
(Explanation: move A from disk D (left peg) and place it on top of disk B (now on C on the middle peg).)

Result after these 7 moves (cost = 7): middle peg top→bottom A, B, C; left peg top→bottom D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, O, P, Q, R, S, T; right peg empty — matches the specified goal.
