Planned execution (11 steps). Each step shows a timestamp assuming 1 time unit per move (start at t=0). Actions follow the provided plan exactly.

1. Step 1 (t=0.0 → 1.0): agent_1: move disk A from left to middle. (A was on top of B on the left; middle was empty.)
2. Step 2 (t=1.0 → 2.0): agent_1: move disk A from middle to right. (A was top on middle; right was empty.)
3. Step 3 (t=2.0 → 3.0): agent_1: move disk B from left to middle. (B was on top of C on the left; middle was empty after step 2.)
4. Step 4 (t=3.0 → 4.0): agent_1: move disk A from right to middle (onto disk B). (Places A on top of B on middle.)
5. Step 5 (t=4.0 → 5.0): agent_1: move disk C from left to right. (C was on top of D on the left; right was empty after step 4.)
6. Step 6 (t=5.0 → 6.0): agent_1: move disk A from middle to left (onto disk D). (Moves A from top of B/middle onto D on the left.)
7. Step 7 (t=6.0 → 7.0): agent_1: move disk B from middle to right (onto disk C). (Places B on top of C on right.)
8. Step 8 (t=7.0 → 8.0): agent_1: move disk A from left to right (onto disk B). (Places A on top of B on right.)
9. Step 9 (t=8.0 → 9.0): agent_1: move disk D from left to middle. (D was under C on left; middle becomes destination.)
10. Step 10 (t=9.0 → 10.0): agent_1: move disk A from right to left (onto disk E). (Places A on top of E on left.)
11. Step 11 (t=10.0 → 11.0): agent_1: move disk B from right to middle (onto disk D). (Places B on top of D on middle.)

Total moves: 11 (unit cost 11). These steps exactly match the provided plan and are consistent with agent_1’s allowed disks and Tower of Hanoi rules.
