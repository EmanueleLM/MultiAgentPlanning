Plan (unit cost = 1 per move). Each step shows start → end time (units) and the human-readable action exactly matching the plan.

1) Time 0 → 1 (duration 1): agent_1: move disk A from disk B to peg right
2) Time 1 → 2 (duration 1): agent_1: move disk B from disk C to peg middle
3) Time 2 → 3 (duration 1): agent_1: move disk A from peg right to disk B
4) Time 3 → 4 (duration 1): agent_1: move disk C from disk D to peg right
5) Time 4 → 5 (duration 1): agent_1: move disk A from disk B to disk D
6) Time 5 → 6 (duration 1): agent_1: move disk B from peg middle to disk C
7) Time 6 → 7 (duration 1): agent_1: move disk A from disk D to disk B
8) Time 7 → 8 (duration 1): agent_1: move disk D from disk E to peg middle

Total cost: 8
