   Note: crate2 remains inside truck0 during the drive.

5) Time stage4 → stage5 (duration: 1 stage)
   Action: hoist3 unloads crate2 from truck0 at distributor0 (hoist3 takes the crate from the truck)
   Agent: hoist_operator (hoist3)
   Preconditions (at start): now = stage4; next(stage4, stage5); hoist3 is at distributor0; truck0 is at distributor0; hoist3 is free; crate2 is in truck0.

   Agent: hoist_operator (hoist3)
   Preconditions (at start): now = stage5; next(stage5, stage6); hoist3 is at distributor0; pallet3 is at distributor0; pallet3 is clear; hoist3 is lifting crate2.
   Effects (at end): hoist3 becomes free and is no longer lifting crate2; crate2 is at distributor0; pallet3 is no longer clear; crate2 becomes clear; crate2 is on pallet3; now = stage6.

7) Time stage6 → stage7 (duration: 1 stage)
   Action: hoist1 lifts crate1 from on top of crate0 at depot1

   Preconditions (at start): now = stage6; next(stage6, stage7); hoist1 is at depot1; crate0 is at depot1; crate1 is at depot1; hoist1 is free; crate1 is clear; crate1 is on crate0.
   Effects (at end): crate1 is removed from the place (no longer at depot1); hoist1 is lifting crate1; hoist1 is not free; crate0 becomes clear; crate1 is no longer on crate0; now = stage7.

8) Time stage7 → stage8 (duration: 1 stage)
   Action: hoist1 loads crate1 into truck1 at depot1
   Agent: hoist_operator (hoist1)
   Preconditions (at start): now = stage7; next(stage7, stage8); hoist1 is at depot1; truck1 is at depot1; hoist1 is lifting crate1.
   Effects (at end): crate1 is in truck1; crate1 is not at the place (depot1); hoist1 becomes free; hoist1 is no longer lifting crate1; now = stage8.

9) Time stage8 → stage9 (duration: 1 stage)
   Action: hoist1 lifts crate0 from pallet1 at depot1
   Agent: hoist_operator (hoist1)
   Preconditions (at start): now = stage8; next(stage8, stage9); hoist1 is at depot1; pallet1 is at depot1; crate0 is at depot1; hoist1 is free; crate0 is clear; crate0 is on pallet1.
   Effects (at end): crate0 is removed from the place (no longer at depot1); hoist1 is lifting crate0; hoist1 is not free; pallet1 becomes clear; crate0 is no longer on pallet1; now = stage9.

10) Time stage9 → stage10 (duration: 1 stage)
    Action: hoist1 loads crate0 into truck1 at depot1
    Agent: hoist_operator (hoist1)
    Preconditions (at start): now = stage9; next(stage9, stage10); hoist1 is at depot1; truck1 is at depot1; hoist1 is lifting crate0.
    Effects (at end): crate0 is in truck1; crate0 is not at the place (depot1); hoist1 becomes free; hoist1 is no longer lifting crate0; now = stage10.

11) Time stage10 → stage11 (duration: 1 stage)
    Action: hoist1 unloads crate1 from truck1 at depot1 (hoist1 takes crate1 out of truck1)
    Agent: hoist_operator (hoist1)
    Preconditions (at start): now = stage10; next(stage10, stage11); hoist1 is at depot1; truck1 is at depot1; hoist1 is free; crate1 is in truck1.
    Effects (at end): crate1 is no longer in truck1; crate1 is not at the place (intermediate, will be placed by hoist); hoist1 is not free and is lifting crate1; now = stage11.

12) Time stage11 → stage12 (duration: 1 stage)
    Action: hoist1 drops crate1 onto pallet1 at depot1
    Agent: hoist_operator (hoist1)
    Preconditions (at start): now = stage11; next(stage11, stage12); hoist1 is at depot1; pallet1 is at depot1; pallet1 is clear; hoist1 is lifting crate1.
    Effects (at end): hoist1 becomes free and is no longer lifting crate1; crate1 is at depot1; pallet1 is no longer clear; crate1 is clear; crate1 is on pallet1; now = stage12.

Final state (after stage12): crate1 is on pallet1 and crate2 is on pallet3 — the specified goals are achieved.
