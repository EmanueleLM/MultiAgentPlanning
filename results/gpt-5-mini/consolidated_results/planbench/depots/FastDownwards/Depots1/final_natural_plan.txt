Plan summary: 15 actions, each takes 1 time unit. Stage transitions map to integer timestamps: stage0->stage1 = t=0..1, stage1->stage2 = t=1..2, ..., stage14->stage15 = t=14..15. Each step below lists: step #, time interval, agent action (parameters), short precondition note, and concrete effects (state changes).

1) t=0 → 1 — loader-lift(hoist0, crate1, crate0, depot0)
- Precondition satisfied: hoist0 at depot0 and available; crate1 is on crate0 at depot0 and crate1 is clear.
- Effects: hoist0 begins lifting crate1 (hoist0 no longer available, hoist-lifting hoist0 crate1); crate1 removed from surface crate0 and no longer recorded at depot0; crate0 becomes clear.

2) t=1 → 2 — loader-lift(hoist2, crate2, pallet2, depot2)
- Precondition satisfied: hoist2 at depot2 and available; crate2 is on pallet2 at depot2 and crate2 is clear.
- Effects: hoist2 begins lifting crate2 (hoist2 no longer available, hoist-lifting hoist2 crate2); crate2 removed from pallet2 and no longer recorded at depot2; pallet2 becomes clear.

3) t=2 → 3 — loader-load(hoist0, crate1, truck0, depot0)
- Precondition satisfied: hoist0 is lifting crate1 at depot0; truck0 is at depot0.
- Effects: crate1 placed in truck0 (in-truck crate1 truck0); hoist0 stops lifting and becomes available.

4) t=3 → 4 — loader-lift(hoist0, crate0, pallet0, depot0)
- Precondition satisfied: hoist0 at depot0 and available; crate0 is on pallet0 at depot0 and crate0 is clear (was cleared in step 1).
- Effects: hoist0 begins lifting crate0 (hoist0 no longer available, hoist-lifting hoist0 crate0); crate0 removed from pallet0 and no longer recorded at depot0; pallet0 becomes clear.

5) t=4 → 5 — loader-load(hoist0, crate0, truck0, depot0)
- Precondition satisfied: hoist0 lifting crate0 at depot0; truck0 at depot0.
- Effects: crate0 placed in truck0 (in-truck crate0 truck0); hoist0 stops lifting and becomes available; crate0 no longer recorded at depot0.

6) t=5 → 6 — loader-unload(hoist0, crate1, truck0, depot0)
- Precondition satisfied: hoist0 at depot0 and available; truck0 at depot0; crate1 is in truck0.
- Effects: crate1 removed from truck0 (not in-truck); hoist0 begins lifting crate1 (hoist0 no longer available, hoist-lifting hoist0 crate1); crate1 no longer in truck0.

7) t=6 → 7 — loader-drop(hoist0, crate1, pallet0, depot0)
- Precondition satisfied: hoist0 is lifting crate1 at depot0; pallet0 at depot0 and pallet0 is clear.
- Effects: crate1 placed on pallet0 (on crate1 pallet0; surface-at crate1 depot0); pallet0 becomes not clear; crate1 becomes clear; hoist0 stops lifting and becomes available.
- Note: This achieves goal (crate1 on pallet0).

8) t=7 → 8 — driver-drive(truck0, depot0, distributor0)
- Precondition satisfied: truck0 at depot0.
- Effects: truck0 location updated to distributor0 (truck-at truck0 distributor0).

9) t=8 → 9 — loader-unload(hoist3, crate0, truck0, distributor0)
- Precondition satisfied: hoist3 at distributor0 and available; truck0 at distributor0; crate0 is in truck0.
- Effects: crate0 removed from truck0; hoist3 begins lifting crate0 (hoist3 no longer available, hoist-lifting hoist3 crate0); crate0 no longer in truck0.

10) t=9 → 10 — loader-drop(hoist3, crate0, pallet3, distributor0)
- Precondition satisfied: hoist3 is lifting crate0 at distributor0; pallet3 at distributor0 and pallet3 is clear.
- Effects: crate0 placed on pallet3 (on crate0 pallet3; surface-at crate0 distributor0); pallet3 becomes not clear; crate0 becomes clear; hoist3 stops lifting and becomes available.
- Note: This achieves goal (crate0 on pallet3).

11) t=10 → 11 — driver-drive(truck0, distributor0, depot2)
- Precondition satisfied: truck0 at distributor0.
- Effects: truck0 location updated to depot2 (truck-at truck0 depot2).

12) t=11 → 12 — loader-load(hoist2, crate2, truck0, depot2)
- Precondition satisfied: hoist2 is lifting crate2 at depot2 (from step 2); truck0 at depot2.
- Effects: crate2 placed in truck0 (in-truck crate2 truck0); hoist2 stops lifting and becomes available.

13) t=12 → 13 — driver-drive(truck0, depot2, distributor0)
- Precondition satisfied: truck0 at depot2.
- Effects: truck0 location updated to distributor0 (truck-at truck0 distributor0).

14) t=13 → 14 — loader-unload(hoist3, crate2, truck0, distributor0)
- Precondition satisfied: hoist3 at distributor0 and available; truck0 at distributor0; crate2 is in truck0.
- Effects: crate2 removed from truck0; hoist3 begins lifting crate2 (hoist3 no longer available, hoist-lifting hoist3 crate2); crate2 no longer in truck0.

15) t=14 → 15 — loader-drop(hoist3, crate2, crate0, distributor0)
- Precondition satisfied: hoist3 is lifting crate2 at distributor0; crate0 is at distributor0 and is a clear surface (crate0 was placed on pallet3 and left clear).
- Effects: crate2 placed on crate0 (on crate2 crate0; surface-at crate2 distributor0); crate0 becomes not clear (occupied under crate2); crate2 becomes clear; hoist3 stops lifting and becomes available.
- Note: This achieves goal (crate2 on crate0). Combined with step 7 and step 10, all three goal conditions are satisfied:
  - crate0 on pallet3 (step 10)
  - crate1 on pallet0 (step 7)
  - crate2 on crate0 (step 15)

Plan complete at t=15. Total cost (action count) = 15.
