 plan step 1 — time 0.0 (duration 1.0)
 Action: sip(object_8, object_0, object_7)
 - Intuition: form a vase between object_8 and object_0 by using their common relation to object_7.
 - Preconditions checked (all true in the initial state before this step):
   • hand(object_8) — object_8 is held.
   • cats(object_0) — object_0 is a “cats” object.
   • texture(object_7) — object_7 carries the required texture.
   • next(object_8, object_7) — object_8 is next to object_7.
   • next(object_0, object_7) — object_0 is next to object_7.
 - Effects (applied at the end of this step):
   • Added: vase(object_8, object_0)
   • Removed: next(object_8, object_7)
 - State note after step 1:
   • vase(object_8, object_0) is now true.
   • next(object_8, object_7) is no longer true.
   • All other facts unchanged from the initial state.

 plan step 2 — time 1.0 (duration 1.0)
 Action: paltry(object_8, object_0, object_6)
 - Intuition: use the vase between object_8 and object_0 and the relation of object_0 to object_6 to create next(object_8, object_6).
 - Preconditions checked (all true at this time):
   • hand(object_8) — object_8 is held (still true).
   • cats(object_0) — object_0 is a “cats” object (true).
   • texture(object_6) — object_6 carries the required texture (true in initial state).
   • vase(object_8, object_0) — created by step 1 (true).
   • next(object_0, object_6) — present in the initial state (true).
 - Effects (applied at the end of this step):
   • Added: next(object_8, object_6)
   • Removed: vase(object_8, object_0)
 - State note after step 2:
   • next(object_8, object_6) is now true (this is the main achieved fact).
   • vase(object_8, object_0) has been removed.
   • next(object_7, object_6) was already true in the initial state and remains true.

 Summary / Goal verification
 - Required goals:
   • next(object_7, object_6) — already true in the initial state (no actions required).
   • next(object_8, object_6) — achieved by step 2 (paltry).
 - Final result: Both goals are satisfied. Total plan length: 2 actions; total (simulated) time: 2.0 units.
