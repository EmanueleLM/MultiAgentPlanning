Below is a clear, step-by-step, human-readable rendering of the provided PDDL plan. Each step lists the action, the stage token transition, the actors and objects involved, the place, a short plain-language description of what happens, and a timestamp assuming each action takes 1 time unit (start time — end time). I also note the immediate expected effects per the domain semantics.

Step 1 — Time 0.0–1.0 (stage0 → stage1):
Action: hoist-lift (hoist1 lifts crate1 from crate0 at depot1)
Description: Hoist hoist1 (at depot1) lifts crate1 off the top of crate0 (crate0 is the supporting surface) at depot1.
Immediate effects: crate1 removed from crate0 (no longer on that surface and no longer considered at the place), hoist1 becomes unavailable and is now lifting crate1, crate0 (the former support) becomes clear.

Step 2 — Time 1.0–2.0 (stage1 → stage2):
Action: hoist-load-into-truck (hoist1 loads crate1 into truck2 at depot1)
Description: While hoist1 is lifting crate1 at depot1 and truck2 is at depot1, hoist1 places crate1 into truck2 (loads the crate into the truck).
Immediate effects: crate1 is now in truck2 (removed from any surface/place), hoist1 stops lifting and becomes available.

Step 3 — Time 2.0–3.0 (stage2 → stage3):
Action: hoist-lift (hoist1 lifts crate0 from pallet1 at depot1)
Description: Hoist hoist1 (at depot1, available) lifts crate0 up off pallet1 at depot1. Crate0 was supporting crate1 earlier but is now free after step 1.
Immediate effects: crate0 removed from pallet1, hoist1 becomes unavailable and is lifting crate0, pallet1 becomes clear.

Step 4 — Time 3.0–4.0 (stage3 → stage4):
Action: hoist-lift (hoist0 lifts crate2 from pallet0 at depot0)
Description: Hoist hoist0 (at depot0) lifts crate2 off pallet0 at depot0.
Immediate effects: crate2 removed from pallet0, hoist0 becomes unavailable and is lifting crate2, pallet0 becomes clear.

Step 5 — Time 4.0–5.0 (stage4 → stage5):
Action: hoist-load-into-truck (hoist1 loads crate0 into truck2 at depot1)
Description: Hoist hoist1 (lifting crate0 at depot1) loads crate0 into truck2 (truck2 must be at depot1).
Immediate effects: crate0 is now in truck2 (no longer on pallet1 or at depot1), hoist1 stops lifting and becomes available.

Step 6 — Time 5.0–6.0 (stage5 → stage6):
Action: drive-truck (truck2 drives from depot1 to depot0)
Description: Truck truck2 moves from depot1 to depot0.
Immediate effects: truck2 is no longer at depot1 and is now at depot0.

Step 7 — Time 6.0–7.0 (stage6 → stage7):
Action: hoist-load-into-truck (hoist0 loads crate2 into truck2 at depot0)
Description: Hoist hoist0 (lifting crate2 at depot0) loads crate2 into truck2 (which is now at depot0).
Immediate effects: crate2 is now in truck2, hoist0 stops lifting and becomes available.

Step 8 — Time 7.0–8.0 (stage7 → stage8):
Action: hoist-unload-from-truck (hoist0 unloads crate1 from truck2 at depot0)
Description: At depot0, hoist hoist0 (available and at depot0) picks crate1 out of truck2 (unloads crate1 from the truck), beginning to lift it.
Immediate effects: crate1 is removed from truck2, hoist0 becomes unavailable and is lifting crate1.

Step 9 — Time 8.0–9.0 (stage8 → stage9):
Action: hoist-drop (hoist0 drops crate1 to pallet0 at depot0)
Description: Hoist hoist0 (lifting crate1 at depot0) places crate1 down onto pallet0 at depot0.
Immediate effects: crate1 is now on pallet0 at depot0, hoist0 stops lifting and becomes available, pallet0 becomes occupied, crate1 becomes clear.

Step 10 — Time 9.0–10.0 (stage9 → stage10):
Action: drive-truck (truck2 drives from depot0 to depot1)
Description: Truck truck2 moves from depot0 back to depot1.
Immediate effects: truck2 is no longer at depot0 and is now at depot1.

Step 11 — Time 10.0–11.0 (stage10 → stage11):
Action: hoist-unload-from-truck (hoist1 unloads crate2 from truck2 at depot1)
Description: At depot1, hoist hoist1 (available and at depot1) picks crate2 out of truck2 (unloads crate2 from the truck).
Immediate effects: crate2 removed from truck2, hoist1 becomes unavailable and is lifting crate2.

Step 12 — Time 11.0–12.0 (stage11 → stage12):
Action: hoist-drop (hoist1 drops crate2 to pallet1 at depot1)
Description: Hoist hoist1 (lifting crate2 at depot1) places crate2 on pallet1 at depot1.
Immediate effects: crate2 is now on pallet1 at depot1, hoist1 stops lifting and becomes available, pallet1 becomes occupied.

Step 13 — Time 12.0–13.0 (stage12 → stage13):
Action: drive-truck (truck2 drives from depot1 to depot2)
Description: Truck truck2 moves from depot1 to depot2.
Immediate effects: truck2 is no longer at depot1 and is now at depot2.

Step 14 — Time 13.0–14.0 (stage13 → stage14):
Action: hoist-unload-from-truck (hoist2 unloads crate0 from truck2 at depot2)
Description: At depot2, hoist hoist2 (available and at depot2) takes crate0 out of truck2 (unloads crate0 from the truck).
Immediate effects: crate0 removed from truck2, hoist2 becomes unavailable and is lifting crate0.

Step 15 — Time 14.0–15.0 (stage14 → stage15):
Action: hoist-drop (hoist2 drops crate0 to pallet2 at depot2)
Description: Hoist hoist2 (lifting crate0 at depot2) places crate0 down onto pallet2 at depot2.
Immediate effects: crate0 is now on pallet2 at depot2, hoist2 stops lifting and becomes available, pallet2 becomes occupied, crate0 becomes clear.

Plan complete at time 15.0.
Final state (goal achieved): 
- crate0 is on pallet2 (at depot2),
- crate1 is on pallet0 (at depot0),
- crate2 is on pallet1 (at depot1).

Total actions executed: 15 (cost = 15).
