Summary: each action is executed in one stage (assume 1 time unit per action). Stages advance as indicated (stage0 → stage1 → ... → stage9). Below are the 9 actions in the given plan, with timestamps, a short plain-language description, and the key state changes produced by each action.

Step 1 — time 0.0 → 1.0 (stage0 → stage1)
Action: hoist-pick-from-crate(hoist0, crate2, crate1, depot0)
Description: At depot0, hoist0 picks up crate2 from the top of crate1.
Key preconditions used: hoist0 is at depot0 and available; crate2 is on crate1 and crate2 is clear.
Effects (applied at end of step):
- hoist0 becomes busy (no longer available) and is now holding crate2.
- crate2 is removed from on-crate(crate2, crate1) and is no longer recorded at the place while held.
- crate1 becomes clear (it lost the crate it was supporting).
- stage advances to stage1.

Step 2 — time 1.0 → 2.0 (stage1 → stage2)
Action: hoist-move-free(hoist3, distributor0, depot0)
Description: Hoist3, free (not holding anything), moves from distributor0 to depot0.
Key preconditions used: hoist3 is at distributor0 and available.
Effects:
- hoist3 is now at depot0 (no longer at distributor0).
- stage advances to stage2.

Step 3 — time 2.0 → 3.0 (stage2 → stage3)
Action: hoist-pick-from-crate(hoist3, crate1, crate0, depot0)
Description: At depot0, hoist3 picks up crate1 from the top of crate0.
Key preconditions used: hoist3 is at depot0 and available; crate1 is on crate0 and crate1 is clear.
Effects:
- hoist3 becomes busy (not available) and holds crate1.
- crate1 is removed from on-crate(crate1, crate0) and is not recorded at the place while held.
- crate0 becomes clear (it no longer supports crate1).
- stage advances to stage3.

Step 4 — time 3.0 → 4.0 (stage3 → stage4)
Action: hoist-move-free(hoist1, depot1, depot0)
Description: Hoist1, free (not holding anything), moves from depot1 to depot0.
Key preconditions used: hoist1 is at depot1 and available.
Effects:
- hoist1 is now at depot0 (no longer at depot1).
- stage advances to stage4.

Step 5 — time 4.0 → 5.0 (stage4 → stage5)
Action: hoist-pick-from-pallet(hoist1, crate0, pallet0, depot0)
Description: At depot0, hoist1 picks up crate0 from pallet0.
Key preconditions used: hoist1 is at depot0 and available; crate0 is on pallet0 and crate0 is clear (it became clear in Step 3).
Effects:
- hoist1 becomes busy and holds crate0.
- crate0 is removed from on-pallet(crate0, pallet0) and is not recorded at the place while held.
- pallet0 becomes clear (its top is empty).
- stage advances to stage5.

Step 6 — time 5.0 → 6.0 (stage5 → stage6)
Action: hoist-place-on-pallet(hoist0, crate2, pallet0, depot0)
Description: At depot0, hoist0 (which was holding crate2 from Step 1) places crate2 onto pallet0.
Key preconditions used: hoist0 is at depot0 and holding crate2; pallet0 is at depot0 and clear (it became clear in Step 5).
Effects:
- hoist0 stops holding crate2 and becomes available.
- crate2 is placed on pallet0 (on-pallet(crate2, pallet0) becomes true).
- crate2 is recorded at depot0.
- pallet0 is no longer clear (it now supports crate2).
- crate2 is clear (top of the crate).
- stage advances to stage6.

Step 7 — time 6.0 → 7.0 (stage6 → stage7)
Action: hoist-place-on-crate(hoist3, crate1, crate2, depot0)
Description: At depot0, hoist3 (holding crate1 from Step 3) places crate1 on top of crate2.
Key preconditions used: hoist3 is at depot0 and holding crate1; crate2 is at depot0 and clear (crate2 was placed and left clear in Step 6).
Effects:
- hoist3 stops holding crate1 and becomes available.
- crate1 is placed on crate2 (on-crate(crate1, crate2) becomes true).
- crate2 is no longer clear (it now supports crate1).
- crate1 is marked clear (top of crate1).
- crate1 is recorded at depot0.
- stage advances to stage7.

Step 8 — time 7.0 → 8.0 (stage7 → stage8)
Action: hoist-move-with(hoist1, crate0, depot0, depot1)
Description: Hoist1, while holding crate0 (from Step 5), moves from depot0 to depot1 carrying crate0.
Key preconditions used: hoist1 is at depot0 and is holding crate0.
Effects:
- hoist1 is now at depot1 (no longer at depot0).
- crate0 remains held by hoist1 (not recorded at any place while in transit).
- stage advances to stage8.

Step 9 — time 8.0 → 9.0 (stage8 → stage9)
Action: hoist-place-on-pallet(hoist1, crate0, pallet1, depot1)
Description: At depot1, hoist1 (holding crate0) places crate0 onto pallet1.
Key preconditions used: hoist1 is at depot1 and holding crate0; pallet1 is at depot1 and is clear (given initially).
Effects:
- hoist1 stops holding crate0 and becomes available.
- crate0 is placed on pallet1 (on-pallet(crate0, pallet1) becomes true).
- pallet1 is no longer clear.
- crate0 is recorded at depot1 and is clear (top).
- stage advances to stage9.

Final state (relevant goal predicates satisfied):
- on-pallet(crate0, pallet1) — crate0 on pallet1 (goal achieved).
- on-crate(crate1, crate2) — crate1 on crate2 (goal achieved).
- on-pallet(crate2, pallet0) — crate2 on pallet0 (goal achieved).

Total stages used: stage0 → stage9 (9 actions, each 1 time unit). The sequence of actions and the described effects follow the provided plan exactly and achieve the specified stacking goal.
