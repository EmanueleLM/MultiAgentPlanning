PROBLEM
------------------------------
I have to plan the logistics of transporting crates between a number of depots and distributors via trucks that are loaded by hoists. Depots and distributors are directly connected by roads (trucks can drive between any two depots or distributors).

A depot is a type of place.
A distributor is a type of place.
A pallet is a type of surface.
A crate is a type of surface.

Here are the actions that can be performed:

Drive a truck from one place to another place.
Use a hoist to lift a crate from a surface at a place.
Use a hoist to drop a crate to a surface at a place.
Use a hoist to load a crate into a truck at a place.
Use a hoist to unload a crate from a truck at a place.

The following are the restrictions on the actions:
A truck can be driven from one place to another place only if the truck is at the origin place.
Once a truck has been driven from one place to another, it is not at the origin place and is at the destination place.
A crate can be lifted by a hoist only if the hoist is at the same place as the crate, the hoist is available, and the crate is clear.
Once a crate has been lifted by a hoist from a surface at a place, the crate is not at the place, the hoist is lifting the crate, the hoist is not available, the surface is clear, and the crate is not on the surface.
A crate can be dropped by a hoist to a surface only if the hoist and surface are both at the place, the surface is clear, and the hoist is lifting the crate.
Once a crate has been dropped by a hoist to a surface at a place, the hoist is available, the hoist is not lifting the crate, the crate is at the place, the surface is not clear, the crate is clear, and the crate is on the surface.
A crate can be loaded by a hoist onto a truck at a place only if the hoist is at the same place, the truck is at the same place, and the hoist is lifting the crate.
Once a crate has been loaded by a hoist onto a truck at a place, 
A crate can be unloaded by a hoist from a truck at a place only if the hoist is at the same place as the truck, the hoist is available, and the crate is in the truck.
Once a crate has been unloaded by a hoist from a truck at a place, the crate is not in the truck, the hoist is not available, and the hoist is lifting the crate.

[STATEMENT]
As initial conditions I have that, crate0 is at depot1, crate1 is at distributor0, crate2 is at depot1, hoist0 is at depot0, hoist1 is at depot1, hoist2 is at depot2, hoist3 is at distributor0, pallet0 is at depot0, pallet1 is at depot1, pallet2 is at depot2, pallet3 is at distributor0, truck0 is at depot1, truck1 is at depot2, truck2 is at distributor0, hoist0 is available, hoist1 is available, hoist2 is available, hoist3 is available, crate1 is clear, crate2 is clear, pallet0 is clear, pallet2 is clear, crate0 is on pallet1, crate1 is on pallet3 and crate2 is on crate0.
My goal is to have that crate0 is on pallet0 and crate2 is on pallet1.

My plan is as follows:

NATURAL-PLAN sas_plan_5
------------------------------
Plan timeline (each action takes 1 time unit). Initial time t=0. Total cost = 6.

1) t=0 → t=1 (duration 1)
   Action: Hoist hoist1 lifts crate2 from crate0 at depot1.
   - Agent: hoist1
   - Preconditions satisfied: hoist1 is at depot1 and free; crate2 is on crate0 at depot1; crate2 is clear (top).
   - Effects: hoist1 begins lifting crate2 (hoist1 no longer free); crate2 is removed from crate0 and is no longer considered at the place; crate0 becomes clear (it is now free of the top crate).

2) t=1 → t=2 (duration 1)
   Action: Hoist hoist0 moves from depot0 to depot1.
   - Agent: hoist0
   - Preconditions satisfied: hoist0 is at depot0.
   - Effects: hoist0 is now at depot1 (and no longer at depot0).

3) t=2 → t=3 (duration 1)
   Action: Hoist hoist0 lifts crate0 from pallet1 at depot1.
   - Agent: hoist0
   - Preconditions satisfied: hoist0 is at depot1 and free; pallet1 is at depot1; crate0 is on pallet1; crate0 is clear (became clear after step 1).
   - Effects: hoist0 begins lifting crate0 (hoist0 no longer free); crate0 is removed from pallet1 and is no longer considered at the place; pallet1 becomes clear.

4) t=3 → t=4 (duration 1)
   Action: Hoist hoist0 moves from depot1 back to depot0.
   - Agent: hoist0
   - Preconditions satisfied: hoist0 is at depot1 (carrying/lifting crate0).
   - Effects: hoist0 (with crate0 lifted) is now at depot0 (and no longer at depot1).

5) t=4 → t=5 (duration 1)
   Action: Hoist hoist0 drops crate0 onto pallet0 at depot0.
   - Agent: hoist0
   - Preconditions satisfied: hoist0 is at depot0 and is lifting crate0; pallet0 is at depot0 and is clear.
   - Effects: crate0 is placed on pallet0 at depot0; hoist0 becomes free and stops lifting crate0; pallet0 becomes not clear; crate0 becomes clear (top).

6) t=5 → t=6 (duration 1)
   Action: Hoist hoist1 drops crate2 onto pallet1 at depot1.
   - Agent: hoist1
   - Preconditions satisfied: hoist1 is at depot1 and is lifting crate2; pallet1 is at depot1 and is clear (became clear in step 3).
   - Effects: crate2 is placed on pallet1 at depot1; hoist1 becomes free and stops lifting crate2; pallet1 becomes not clear; crate2 becomes clear.

Outcome at t=6:
- crate0 is on pallet0 (goal satisfied).
- crate2 is on pallet1 (goal satisfied).

PROBLEM
------------------------------
I have to plan the logistics of transporting crates between a number of depots and distributors via trucks that are loaded by hoists. Depots and distributors are directly connected by roads (trucks can drive between any two depots or distributors).

A depot is a type of place.
A distributor is a type of place.
A pallet is a type of surface.
A crate is a type of surface.

Here are the actions that can be performed:

Drive a truck from one place to another place.
Use a hoist to lift a crate from a surface at a place.
Use a hoist to drop a crate to a surface at a place.
Use a hoist to load a crate into a truck at a place.
Use a hoist to unload a crate from a truck at a place.

The following are the restrictions on the actions:
A truck can be driven from one place to another place only if the truck is at the origin place.
Once a truck has been driven from one place to another, it is not at the origin place and is at the destination place.
A crate can be lifted by a hoist only if the hoist is at the same place as the crate, the hoist is available, and the crate is clear.
Once a crate has been lifted by a hoist from a surface at a place, the crate is not at the place, the hoist is lifting the crate, the hoist is not available, the surface is clear, and the crate is not on the surface.
A crate can be dropped by a hoist to a surface only if the hoist and surface are both at the place, the surface is clear, and the hoist is lifting the crate.
Once a crate has been dropped by a hoist to a surface at a place, the hoist is available, the hoist is not lifting the crate, the crate is at the place, the surface is not clear, the crate is clear, and the crate is on the surface.
A crate can be loaded by a hoist onto a truck at a place only if the hoist is at the same place, the truck is at the same place, and the hoist is lifting the crate.
Once a crate has been loaded by a hoist onto a truck at a place, 
A crate can be unloaded by a hoist from a truck at a place only if the hoist is at the same place as the truck, the hoist is available, and the crate is in the truck.
Once a crate has been unloaded by a hoist from a truck at a place, the crate is not in the truck, the hoist is not available, and the hoist is lifting the crate.

[STATEMENT]
As initial conditions I have that, crate0 is at depot2, crate1 is at distributor0, crate2 is at distributor0, hoist0 is at depot0, hoist1 is at depot1, hoist2 is at depot2, hoist3 is at distributor0, pallet0 is at depot0, pallet1 is at depot1, pallet2 is at depot2, pallet3 is at distributor0, truck0 is at depot1, truck1 is at depot0, truck2 is at depot1, hoist0 is available, hoist1 is available, hoist2 is available, hoist3 is available, crate0 is clear, crate2 is clear, pallet0 is clear, pallet1 is clear, crate0 is on pallet2, crate1 is on pallet3 and crate2 is on crate1.
My goal is to have that crate0 is on crate1, crate1 is on pallet3 and crate2 is on pallet1.

My plan is as follows:

NATURAL-PLAN sas_plan_5
------------------------------
1) step0 → step1 (hoist action)
- Action: hoist2 lifts crate0 off pallet2 at depot2.
- Result: crate0 is removed from pallet2 and no longer at depot2; pallet2 becomes clear; hoist2 becomes busy (no longer available) and is now lifting crate0.

2) step1 → step2 (truck action)
- Action: truck2 drives from depot1 to depot2.
- Result: truck2 is at depot2 (no longer at depot1).

3) step2 → step3 (hoist action)
- Action: hoist2 (holding crate0) loads crate0 into truck2 at depot2.
- Result: crate0 is now inside truck2; hoist2 becomes available and is no longer lifting crate0; crate0 is no longer at depot2.

4) step3 → step4 (truck action)
- Action: truck2 drives from depot2 to distributor0.
- Result: truck2 is at distributor0 (carrying crate0).

5) step4 → step5 (hoist action)
- Action: hoist3 lifts crate2 from on top of crate1 (crate1 is on pallet3) at distributor0.
- Result: crate2 is removed from on-crate(crate2, crate1) and no longer at distributor0; crate1 becomes clear; hoist3 becomes busy and is now lifting crate2.

6) step5 → step6 (hoist action)
- Action: hoist3 (holding crate2) loads crate2 into truck2 at distributor0.
- Result: crate2 is now inside truck2; hoist3 becomes available and is no longer lifting crate2; crate2 is no longer at distributor0.

7) step6 → step7 (hoist action)
- Action: hoist3 unloads crate0 from truck2 at distributor0 (hoist3 takes crate0 from the truck and holds it).
- Result: crate0 is removed from truck2; hoist3 becomes busy and is now lifting crate0; crate0 is not placed on any surface yet.

8) step7 → step8 (truck action)
- Action: truck2 drives from distributor0 back to depot1.
- Result: truck2 is at depot1 (no longer at distributor0). crate0 remains held by hoist3 at distributor0.

9) step8 → step9 (hoist action)
- Action: hoist1 unloads crate2 from truck2 at depot1 (hoist1 takes crate2 out of the truck and holds it).
- Result: crate2 is removed from truck2; hoist1 becomes busy and is now lifting crate2; crate2 is not placed on any surface yet.

10) step9 → step10 (hoist action)
- Action: hoist1 drops crate2 onto pallet1 at depot1.
- Result: crate2 is placed on pallet1 at depot1; pallet1 becomes not clear; hoist1 becomes available and is no longer lifting crate2; crate2 is clear and at depot1.

11) step10 → step11 (hoist action)
- Action: hoist3 drops crate0 onto crate1 (crate1 remains on pallet3) at distributor0.
- Result: crate0 is placed on top of crate1 (crate0 on-crate crate1) at distributor0; crate1 becomes not clear; crate0 is clear; hoist3 becomes available and is no longer lifting crate0.

Final check (after step11):
- crate0 is on crate1 ✓
- crate1 is on pallet3 ✓
- crate2 is on pallet1 ✓

All three goal conditions are satisfied.
