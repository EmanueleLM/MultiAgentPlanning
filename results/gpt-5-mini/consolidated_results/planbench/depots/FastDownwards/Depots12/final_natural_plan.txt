1) step0 → step1 (hoist action)
- Action: hoist2 lifts crate0 off pallet2 at depot2.
- Result: crate0 is removed from pallet2 and no longer at depot2; pallet2 becomes clear; hoist2 becomes busy (no longer available) and is now lifting crate0.

2) step1 → step2 (truck action)
- Action: truck2 drives from depot1 to depot2.
- Result: truck2 is at depot2 (no longer at depot1).

3) step2 → step3 (hoist action)
- Action: hoist2 (holding crate0) loads crate0 into truck2 at depot2.
- Result: crate0 is now inside truck2; hoist2 becomes available and is no longer lifting crate0; crate0 is no longer at depot2.

4) step3 → step4 (truck action)
- Action: truck2 drives from depot2 to distributor0.
- Result: truck2 is at distributor0 (carrying crate0).

5) step4 → step5 (hoist action)
- Action: hoist3 lifts crate2 from on top of crate1 (crate1 is on pallet3) at distributor0.
- Result: crate2 is removed from on-crate(crate2, crate1) and no longer at distributor0; crate1 becomes clear; hoist3 becomes busy and is now lifting crate2.

6) step5 → step6 (hoist action)
- Action: hoist3 (holding crate2) loads crate2 into truck2 at distributor0.
- Result: crate2 is now inside truck2; hoist3 becomes available and is no longer lifting crate2; crate2 is no longer at distributor0.

7) step6 → step7 (hoist action)
- Action: hoist3 unloads crate0 from truck2 at distributor0 (hoist3 takes crate0 from the truck and holds it).
- Result: crate0 is removed from truck2; hoist3 becomes busy and is now lifting crate0; crate0 is not placed on any surface yet.

8) step7 → step8 (truck action)
- Action: truck2 drives from distributor0 back to depot1.
- Result: truck2 is at depot1 (no longer at distributor0). crate0 remains held by hoist3 at distributor0.

9) step8 → step9 (hoist action)
- Action: hoist1 unloads crate2 from truck2 at depot1 (hoist1 takes crate2 out of the truck and holds it).
- Result: crate2 is removed from truck2; hoist1 becomes busy and is now lifting crate2; crate2 is not placed on any surface yet.

10) step9 → step10 (hoist action)
- Action: hoist1 drops crate2 onto pallet1 at depot1.
- Result: crate2 is placed on pallet1 at depot1; pallet1 becomes not clear; hoist1 becomes available and is no longer lifting crate2; crate2 is clear and at depot1.

11) step10 → step11 (hoist action)
- Action: hoist3 drops crate0 onto crate1 (crate1 remains on pallet3) at distributor0.
- Result: crate0 is placed on top of crate1 (crate0 on-crate crate1) at distributor0; crate1 becomes not clear; crate0 is clear; hoist3 becomes available and is no longer lifting crate0.

Final check (after step11):
- crate0 is on crate1 ✓
- crate1 is on pallet3 ✓
- crate2 is on pallet1 ✓

All three goal conditions are satisfied.
