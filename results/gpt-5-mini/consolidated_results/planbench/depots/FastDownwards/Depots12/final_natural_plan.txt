Below is a human-readable, timestamped walkthrough of the provided PDDL plan. Each step lists the action (with its parameters), the preconditions that action requires (per the domain), and the effects it produces. I assume a simple schedule where each action takes 1 time unit; timestamps start at t=0 and increment by 1. The sequence exactly matches the given plan (no actions added or removed).

Summary: 20 actions, each duration = 1 time unit, total makespan = 20 time units, total cost = 20.

Final state and goal satisfaction
- After step 20 (t=19→t=20), the plan produces the following goal-relevant next relations required by the combined problem:
  - next(object_10, object_8) — produced at step 20
  - next(object_11, object_7) — produced at step 13
  - next(object_9, object_6) — produced at step 8
  - next(object_10, object_7) — produced at step 17
  - next(object_11, object_9) — produced at step 12
  - next(object_12, object_8) — produced at step 15
- Thus the combined conjunctive goal (Goal A + Goal B) is satisfied by the above sequence.

Notes
- Each listed precondition and effect follows the domain action schemas.
- Timestamps are given for readability; each action is assumed to occupy one unit of time (you can map these to actual durations if a different time granularity is desired).
- The sequence exactly mirrors the provided PDDL plan (20 actions, cost = 20).
