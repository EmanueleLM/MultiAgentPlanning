5) Stage4 -> Stage5 (duration 1)

6) Stage5 -> Stage6 (duration 1)
   Action: Hoist hoist2 loads crate0 into truck0 at depot2.
   Actor: hoist2 (loading), truck0 (receiving)
   Precondition satisfied: hoist2 attached to crate0; truck0 at depot2 (from step 5).

7) Stage6 -> Stage7 (duration 1)
   Action: Drive truck0 from depot2 to depot1 (bringing crate0 and crate2 inside).
   Actor: truck0
   Precondition satisfied: truck0 at depot2 (from step 5/6); crate0 and crate2 inside truck0.
   Effect: truck0 at depot1 (crates remain in truck0).

8) Stage7 -> Stage8 (duration 1)
   Action: Hoist hoist1 unloads crate0 from truck0 at depot1.
   Actor: hoist1 (unloading), truck0 (source)
   Precondition satisfied: hoist1 free and at depot1; truck0 at depot1; crate0 in truck0.

9) Stage8 -> Stage9 (duration 1)
   Action: Hoist hoist1 drops crate0 onto pallet1 at depot1.
   Actor: hoist1
   Precondition satisfied: hoist1 attached to crate0; pallet1 located at depot1 and is clear (pallet1 was cleared in step 2).
   Effect: crate0 on pallet1; hoist1 becomes free; pallet1 no longer clear; crate0 becomes clear.

10) Stage9 -> Stage10 (duration 1)
    Action: Hoist hoist1 unloads crate2 from truck0 at depot1.
