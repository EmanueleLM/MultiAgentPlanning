8) Time step7 → step8 (t=7..8)
   Action: hoist_load(hoist3, crate2, truck0) at distributor0
   Preconditions (satisfied): hoist3 at distributor0; truck0 at distributor0; hoist3 is lifting crate2.
   Effects: crate2 is placed into truck0 (in(crate2,truck0)); hoist3 stops lifting and becomes available; time cursor advances to step8.

9) Time step8 → step9 (t=8..9)
   Action: hoist_lift_from_pallet(hoist3, crate1, pallet3) at distributor0
   Preconditions (satisfied): hoist3 at distributor0 and available; pallet3 at distributor0; crate1 on pallet3; crate1 is clear (made clear when crate2 was lifted).
   Effects: hoist3 lifts crate1 (lifting(crate1)); crate1 is removed from pallet3 and not at the place; pallet3 becomes clear; hoist3 becomes not available; time cursor advances to step9.

10) Time step9 → step10 (t=9..10)
    Action: hoist_load(hoist3, crate1, truck0) at distributor0
    Preconditions (satisfied): hoist3 at distributor0; truck0 at distributor0; hoist3 is lifting crate1.
    Effects: crate1 is placed into truck0 (in(crate1,truck0)); hoist3 stops lifting and becomes available; time cursor advances to step10.

11) Time step10 → step11 (t=10..11)
    Action: drive(truck0, distributor0 → depot1)
    Preconditions (satisfied): truck0 at distributor0; time cursor at step10 and next(step10,step11).
    Effects: truck0 is moved to depot1; time cursor advances to step11.

12) Time step11 → step12 (t=11..12)
    Action: hoist_unload(hoist1, crate2, truck0) at depot1
    Preconditions (satisfied): hoist1 at depot1 and available; truck0 at depot1; crate2 is in truck0.
    Effects: crate2 is removed from truck0 and hoist1 begins lifting crate2 (hoist1 becomes not available, lifting(crate2)); time cursor advances to step12.

13) Time step12 → step13 (t=12..13)
    Action: drive(truck0, depot1 → depot2)
    Preconditions (satisfied): truck0 at depot1; time cursor at step12 and next(step12,step13).
    Effects: truck0 is moved to depot2; time cursor advances to step13.

14) Time step13 → step14 (t=13..14)
    Action: hoist_unload(hoist2, crate1, truck0) at depot2
    Preconditions (satisfied): hoist2 at depot2 and available; truck0 at depot2; crate1 is in truck0.
    Effects: crate1 is removed from truck0 and hoist2 begins lifting crate1 (hoist2 becomes not available, lifting(crate1)); time cursor advances to step14.

15) Time step14 → step15 (t=14..15)
    Action: hoist_drop_to_pallet(hoist1, crate2, pallet1) at depot1
    Preconditions (satisfied): hoist1 at depot1 and lifting crate2; pallet1 at depot1 and clear.
    Effects: crate2 is placed on pallet1 (on-crate-pallet(crate2,pallet1)); pallet1 becomes not clear; crate2 becomes clear; hoist1 stops lifting and becomes available; crate2 is at depot1; time cursor advances to step15.

16) Time step15 → step16 (t=15..16)
    Action: hoist_drop_to_pallet(hoist2, crate1, pallet2) at depot2
    Preconditions (satisfied): hoist2 at depot2 and lifting crate1; pallet2 at depot2 and clear (it was cleared when crate0 was lifted).
    Effects: crate1 is placed on pallet2 (on-crate-pallet(crate1,pallet2)); pallet2 becomes not clear; crate1 becomes clear; hoist2 stops lifting and becomes available; crate1 is at depot2; time cursor advances to step16.

Final result after step16:
- crate0 on pallet0 (depot0)
- crate1 on pallet2 (depot2)
- crate2 on pallet1 (depot1)

These final stackings match the global goal. Each action listed above follows the hoist/truck preconditions and effects defined in the domain and is ordered exactly as in the provided plan (one discrete time-step per action).
