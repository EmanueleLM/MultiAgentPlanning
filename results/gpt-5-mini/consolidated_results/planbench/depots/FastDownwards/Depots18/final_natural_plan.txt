5. Time s4 → s5: Drive truck1 from depot0 to depot2 again. (Action: drive-truck truck1 depot0→depot2; time s4→s5.)

6. Time s5 → s6: Drive truck2 from distributor0 to depot1. (Action: drive-truck truck2 distributor0→depot1; time s5→s6.)

7. Time s6 → s7: Hoist0 lifts crate1 from pallet0 at depot0. (Action: hoist-lift-from-pallet hoist0 pallet0 crate1 at depot0; hoist0 becomes busy/holding crate1; pallet0 becomes clear; time s6→s7.)

8. Time s7 → s8: Drive truck1 from depot2 to depot0. (Action: drive-truck truck1 depot2→depot0; time s7→s8.)

9. Time s8 → s9: Hoist0 loads the held crate1 into truck1 at depot0. (Action: hoist-load-to-truck hoist0 crate1 truck1 at depot0; crate1 enters truck1; hoist0 becomes available; time s8→s9.)

10. Time s9 → s10: Drive truck1 from depot0 to depot2 (carrying crate1). (Action: drive-truck truck1 depot0→depot2; time s9→s10.)

11. Time s10 → s11: Hoist2 unloads crate1 from truck1 at depot2 (hoist2 starts lifting crate1). (Action: hoist-unload-from-truck hoist2 crate1 truck1 at depot2; crate1 leaves truck1, hoist2 becomes busy/holding crate1; time s10→s11.)

12. Time s11 → s12: Hoist2 drops the held crate1 onto pallet2 at depot2. (Action: hoist-drop-to-pallet hoist2 crate1 pallet2 at depot2; crate1 is now on pallet2, pallet2 becomes not clear, hoist2 becomes available; time s11→s12.)

13. Time s12 → s13: Hoist3 lifts crate2 from pallet3 at distributor0. (Action: hoist-lift-from-pallet hoist3 pallet3 crate2 at distributor0; hoist3 becomes busy/holding crate2; pallet3 becomes clear; time s12→s13.)

14. Time s13 → s14: Drive truck0 from distributor0 to depot1. (Action: drive-truck truck0 distributor0→depot1; time s13→s14.)

15. Time s14 → s15: Hoist3 drops the held crate2 back onto pallet3 at distributor0. (Action: hoist-drop-to-pallet hoist3 crate2 pallet3 at distributor0; crate2 is on pallet3 again, pallet3 becomes not clear, hoist3 becomes available; time s14→s15.)

16. Time s15 → s16: Hoist1 lifts crate0 from pallet1 at depot1. (Action: hoist-lift-from-pallet hoist1 pallet1 crate0 at depot1; hoist1 becomes busy/holding crate0; pallet1 becomes clear; time s15→s16.)

17. Time s16 → s17: Hoist1 loads the held crate0 into truck0 at depot1. (Action: hoist-load-to-truck hoist1 crate0 truck0 at depot1; crate0 enters truck0, hoist1 becomes available; time s16→s17.)

18. Time s17 → s18: Drive truck0 from depot1 to distributor0 (carrying crate0). (Action: drive-truck truck0 depot1→distributor0; time s17→s18.)

19. Time s18 → s19: Hoist3 unloads crate0 from truck0 at distributor0 (hoist3 starts lifting crate0). (Action: hoist-unload-from-truck hoist3 crate0 truck0 at distributor0; crate0 leaves truck0, hoist3 becomes busy/holding crate0; time s18→s19.)

20. Time s19 → s20: Hoist3 drops the held crate0 onto crate2 at distributor0. (Action: hoist-drop-to-crate hoist3 crate0 crate2 at distributor0; crate0 is now on crate2, crate2 becomes not clear, hoist3 becomes available; time s19→s20.)

Final state after time s20: crate0 is on crate2, crate1 is on pallet2, and crate2 is on pallet3; global current time is s20.
