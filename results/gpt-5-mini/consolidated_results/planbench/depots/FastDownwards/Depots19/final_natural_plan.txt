1) Time s0 → s1 (duration: 1 unit) — hoist-lift by hoist0
   - Action: hoist0 lifts crate1 off crate0 at depot0.
   - Preconditions satisfied: hoist0 is at depot0 and available; crate1 is on crate0 at depot0 and crate1 is clear.
   - Effect (succinct): hoist0 is now holding crate1; crate1 is no longer on crate0 and no longer recorded at that surface; crate0 becomes clear.

2) Time s1 → s2 (duration: 1 unit) — hoist-load by hoist0
   - Action: hoist0 loads (places) the held crate1 into truck0 at depot0.
   - Preconditions satisfied: hoist0 at depot0 holding crate1; truck0 is at depot0.
   - Effect (succinct): crate1 is now in-truck truck0; hoist0 becomes available and is no longer holding crate1.

3) Time s2 → s3 (duration: 1 unit) — drive-truck by truck0
   - Action: truck0 drives from depot0 to depot1.
   - Preconditions satisfied: truck0 is at depot0; road (connected) between depot0 and depot1 exists.
   - Effect (succinct): truck0 is now at depot1 (no longer at depot0).

4) Time s3 → s4 (duration: 1 unit) — hoist-unload by hoist1
   - Action: hoist1 unloads crate1 from truck0 at depot1 (hoist1 at depot1).
   - Preconditions satisfied: hoist1 at depot1 and available; truck0 at depot1; crate1 is in truck0.
   - Effect (succinct): hoist1 is now holding crate1; crate1 is no longer in truck0; hoist1 becomes not available (holding).

5) Time s4 → s5 (duration: 1 unit) — hoist-drop by hoist1
   - Action: hoist1 drops crate1 onto pallet1 at depot1.
   - Preconditions satisfied: hoist1 at depot1 holding crate1; pallet1 at depot1 and pallet1 is clear.
   - Effect (succinct): crate1 is on pallet1 at depot1; pallet1 is no longer clear; hoist1 becomes available; crate1 becomes clear (topmost).

6) Time s5 → s6 (duration: 1 unit) — hoist-lift by hoist0
   - Action: hoist0 lifts crate0 off pallet0 at depot0.
   - Preconditions satisfied: hoist0 at depot0 and available; crate0 is on pallet0 at depot0 and crate0 is clear (after earlier steps crate0 was cleared).
   - Effect (succinct): hoist0 is now holding crate0; crate0 is no longer on pallet0; pallet0 becomes clear; hoist0 becomes not available.

7) Time s6 → s7 (duration: 1 unit) — drive-truck by truck0
   - Action: truck0 drives from depot1 back to depot0.
   - Preconditions satisfied: truck0 at depot1; road (connected) between depot1 and depot0 exists.
   - Effect (succinct): truck0 is now at depot0 (no longer at depot1).

8) Time s7 → s8 (duration: 1 unit) — hoist-load by hoist0
   - Action: hoist0 loads the held crate0 into truck0 at depot0.
   - Preconditions satisfied: hoist0 at depot0 holding crate0; truck0 at depot0.
   - Effect (succinct): crate0 is now in-truck truck0; hoist0 becomes available and is no longer holding crate0.

9) Time s8 → s9 (duration: 1 unit) — drive-truck by truck0
   - Action: truck0 drives from depot0 to depot1.
   - Preconditions satisfied: truck0 at depot0; road (connected) between depot0 and depot1 exists.
   - Effect (succinct): truck0 is now at depot1 (no longer at depot0).

10) Time s9 → s10 (duration: 1 unit) — hoist-unload by hoist1
    - Action: hoist1 unloads crate0 from truck0 at depot1 (hoist1 at depot1).
    - Preconditions satisfied: hoist1 at depot1 and available; truck0 at depot1; crate0 is in truck0.
    - Effect (succinct): hoist1 is now holding crate0; crate0 is no longer in truck0; hoist1 becomes not available (holding).

11) Time s10 → s11 (duration: 1 unit) — hoist-drop by hoist1
    - Action: hoist1 drops crate0 onto crate1 at depot1 (crate1 is on pallet1).
    - Preconditions satisfied: hoist1 at depot1 holding crate0; crate1 is at depot1 and clear (topmost) and can accept crate0.
    - Effect (succinct): crate0 is now on crate1 at depot1; crate1 is no longer clear; hoist1 becomes available; the final desired stacking is achieved.

Final state after s11:
- crate1 is on pallet1 (crate1 on pallet1).
- crate0 is on crate1 (crate0 on crate1).
These satisfy the goal: crate0 on crate1 and crate1 on pallet1.
