Step 1 [0.0 — 1.0]:
Action: wretched object_3 object_7 object_6 object_1
- Schema (agent_beta): wretched ?p ?q ?r ?s
- Preconditions required: (sneeze object_3), (texture object_7), (texture object_6), (stupendous object_1), (next object_3 object_7), (collect object_7 object_1), (collect object_6 object_1)
- Effects: add (next object_3 object_6), delete (next object_3 object_7)

Step 2 [1.0 — 2.0]:
Action: clip object_11 object_3 object_6
- Schema (agent_alpha): clip ?p ?q ?r
- Preconditions required: (hand object_11), (sneeze object_3), (texture object_6), (next object_3 object_6), (next object_11 object_6)
- Effects: add (vase object_11 object_3), delete (next object_11 object_6)

Step 3 [2.0 — 3.0]:
Action: wretched object_3 object_6 object_5 object_1
- Schema (agent_beta): wretched ?p ?q ?r ?s
- Preconditions required: (sneeze object_3), (texture object_6), (texture object_5), (stupendous object_1), (next object_3 object_6), (collect object_6 object_1), (collect object_5 object_1)
- Effects: add (next object_3 object_5), delete (next object_3 object_6)

Step 4 [3.0 — 4.0]:
Action: tightfisted object_11 object_3 object_5
- Schema (agent_beta): tightfisted ?p ?q ?r
- Preconditions required: (hand object_11), (sneeze object_3), (texture object_5), (next object_3 object_5), (vase object_11 object_3)
- Effects: add (next object_11 object_5), delete (vase object_11 object_3)

Step 5 [4.0 — 5.0]:
Action: memory object_0 object_8 object_5
- Schema (agent_beta): memory ?p ?q ?r
- Preconditions required: (cats object_0), (spring object_8), (spring object_5), (next object_0 object_8)
- Effects: add (next object_0 object_5), delete (next object_0 object_8)

Step 6 [5.0 — 6.0]:
Action: sip object_11 object_0 object_5
- Schema (agent_alpha): sip ?p ?q ?r
- Preconditions required: (hand object_11), (cats object_0), (texture object_5), (next object_11 object_5), (next object_0 object_5)
- Effects: add (vase object_11 object_0), delete (next object_11 object_5)

Step 7 [6.0 — 7.0]:
Action: memory object_0 object_5 object_8
- Schema (agent_beta): memory ?p ?q ?r
- Preconditions required: (cats object_0), (spring object_5), (spring object_8), (next object_0 object_5)
- Effects: add (next object_0 object_8), delete (next object_0 object_5)

Step 8 [7.0 — 8.0]:
Action: paltry object_11 object_0 object_8
- Schema (agent_alpha): paltry ?p ?q ?r
- Preconditions required: (hand object_11), (cats object_0), (texture object_8), (vase object_11 object_0), (next object_0 object_8)
- Effects: add (next object_11 object_8), delete (vase object_11 object_0)

Step 9 [8.0 — 9.0]:
Action: clip object_11 object_4 object_8
- Schema (agent_alpha): clip ?p ?q ?r
- Preconditions required: (hand object_11), (sneeze object_4), (texture object_8), (next object_4 object_8), (next object_11 object_8)
- Effects: add (vase object_11 object_4), delete (next object_11 object_8)

Step 10 [9.0 — 10.0]:
Action: wretched object_4 object_8 object_10 object_2
- Schema (agent_beta): wretched ?p ?q ?r ?s
- Preconditions required: (sneeze object_4), (texture object_8), (texture object_10), (stupendous object_2), (next object_4 object_8), (collect object_8 object_2), (collect object_10 object_2)
- Effects: add (next object_4 object_10), delete (next object_4 object_8)

Step 11 [10.0 — 11.0]:
Action: tightfisted object_11 object_4 object_10
- Schema (agent_beta): tightfisted ?p ?q ?r
- Preconditions required: (hand object_11), (sneeze object_4), (texture object_10), (next object_4 object_10), (vase object_11 object_4)
- Effects: add (next object_11 object_10), delete (vase object_11 object_4)

Result:
- The final effect of Step 11 is (next object_11 object_10), which satisfies the goal of Statement A.
- Total plan length / cost: 11 actions (unit cost each) — cost = 11.
