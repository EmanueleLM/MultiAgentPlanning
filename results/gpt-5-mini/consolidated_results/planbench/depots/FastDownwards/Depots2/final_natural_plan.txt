Summary: three sequential hoist actions are executed by hoist2 to move crate2 from atop crate0 at depot2 to pallet3 at distributor0. Each action consumes the next stage token (s0→s1→s2→s3). Assume each action takes one time unit (timestamps shown). Total cost = 3 (unit cost per action). Crate1 was already on pallet0 in the initial state, so the final goals are achieved.

Step 1 — Time 0.0 → 1.0 (stage s0 → s1)
Action: hoist_lift_from_crate hoist2 lifts crate2 from crate0 at depot2
- Parameters: hoist = hoist2, crate = crate2, below = crate0, location = depot2
- Preconditions (satisfied in initial state):
  - hoist2 is at depot2
  - crate2 is on crate0
  - crate0 is at depot2
  - crate2 is clear
  - hoist2 is free
  - stage-ready s0 and succ s0 s1
- Effects:
  - crate2 is no longer on crate0
  - crate2 is no longer considered at depot2 (it is held)
  - hoist2 becomes attached to (holding) crate2
  - hoist2 becomes not free
  - crate0 becomes clear
  - stage-ready token advances (s0 consumed, s1 becomes ready)

State note after Step 1: hoist2 is holding crate2 at depot2 (hoist-attached hoist2 crate2); crate0 is clear; hoist2 not free.

Step 2 — Time 1.0 → 2.0 (stage s1 → s2)
Action: hoist_move hoist2 moves from depot2 to distributor0
- Parameters: hoist = hoist2, from = depot2, to = distributor0
- Preconditions:
  - hoist2 is at depot2 (true after step 1)
  - stage-ready s1 and succ s1 s2
- Effects:
  - hoist2 is no longer at depot2
  - hoist2 is now at distributor0
  - stage-ready token advances (s1 consumed, s2 becomes ready)

State note after Step 2: hoist2 (still holding crate2) is located at distributor0.

Step 3 — Time 2.0 → 3.0 (stage s2 → s3)
Action: hoist_drop_to_pallet hoist2 drops crate2 onto pallet3 at distributor0
- Parameters: hoist = hoist2, crate = crate2, pallet = pallet3, location = distributor0
- Preconditions:
  - hoist2 is attached to (holding) crate2
  - hoist2 is at distributor0
  - pallet3 is at distributor0
  - pallet3 is clear
  - stage-ready s2 and succ s2 s3
- Effects:
  - hoist2 is no longer attached to crate2
  - hoist2 becomes free
  - crate2 is on-pallet pallet3
  - crate2 is at distributor0
  - pallet3 becomes not clear
  - crate2 becomes clear
  - stage-ready token advances (s2 consumed, s3 becomes ready)

Final state (after Time 3.0):
- on-pallet crate1 pallet0 (from initial state) — goal 1 satisfied
- on-pallet crate2 pallet3 — achieved by Step 3 — goal 2 satisfied
- Total plan cost = 3 (3 actions × unit cost)

No actions were added or removed; ordering matches the provided plan exactly. The stage tokens s0→s1→s2→s3 enforce the required sequencing and prevent concurrent interference for these steps.
