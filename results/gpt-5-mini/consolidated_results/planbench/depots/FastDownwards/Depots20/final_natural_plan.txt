   - Effects: crate0 is now in truck1; hoist1 becomes available and is no longer lifting crate0; stage advanced to s6.

7) Time 6 → 7 — Hoist1 unloads crate1 from truck1 at depot1 (hoist1 begins lifting crate1).
   - Action: hoist-unload-from-truck hoist1 takes crate1 out of truck1 at depot1 (stage s6 → s7)
   - Preconditions met: hoist1 at depot1, truck1 at depot1, hoist1 available (from previous step), crate1 is in truck1, current stage s6.
   - Effects: crate1 is removed from truck1; hoist1 becomes unavailable and is now lifting crate1; stage advanced to s7.

8) Time 7 → 8 — Drive truck1 from depot1 back to depot2 (truck1 now carrying crate0).
   - Action: drive-truck truck1 depot1 → depot2 (stage s7 → s8)
   - Preconditions met: truck1 at depot1, current stage s7.
   - Effects: truck1 is now at depot2; crate0 remains in truck1; stage advanced to s8.

9) Time 8 → 9 — Hoist2 unloads crate0 from truck1 at depot2 (hoist2 begins lifting crate0).
   - Action: hoist-unload-from-truck hoist2 takes crate0 out of truck1 at depot2 (stage s8 → s9)
   - Preconditions met: hoist2 at depot2, truck1 at depot2, hoist2 available (it became available after loading crate1), crate0 in truck1, current stage s8.
   - Effects: crate0 is removed from truck1; hoist2 becomes unavailable and is now lifting crate0; stage advanced to s9.

10) Time 9 → 10 — Hoist1 drops crate1 onto pallet1 at depot1.
    - Action: hoist-drop-to-surface hoist1 places crate1 onto pallet1 at depot1 (stage s9 → s10)
    - Preconditions met: hoist1 at depot1, pallet1 at depot1, pallet1 is surface-clear (it became clear when crate0 was lifted earlier), hoist1 is lifting crate1, current stage s9.
    - Effects: crate1 is now on pallet1; pallet1 is no longer clear; crate1 is clear; hoist1 becomes available and is no longer lifting crate1; stage advanced to s10.

11) Time 10 → 11 — Hoist2 drops crate0 onto pallet2 at depot2.
    - Action: hoist-drop-to-surface hoist2 places crate0 onto pallet2 at depot2 (stage s10 → s11)
    - Preconditions met: hoist2 at depot2, pallet2 at depot2, pallet2 is surface-clear (it became clear when crate1 was lifted earlier), hoist2 is lifting crate0, current stage s10.
    - Effects: crate0 is now on pallet2; pallet2 is no longer clear; crate0 is clear; hoist2 becomes available and is no longer lifting crate0; stage advanced to s11.

Final state verification (after Time 11):
- crate0 is on pallet2 (goal satisfied).
- crate1 is on pallet1 (goal satisfied).
- crate2 remains on pallet0 (unchanged, goal satisfied).
All three goal conditions are met. Total actions executed: 11 (cost = 11).
