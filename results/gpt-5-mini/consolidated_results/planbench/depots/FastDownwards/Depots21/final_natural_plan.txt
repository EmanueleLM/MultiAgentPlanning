Here is a clear, step-by-step, human-readable execution of the provided plan. Each step shows the acting agent, the action, the objects and place involved, the step transition (si -> si+1) and a short summary of immediate effects. Each action is assumed to take 1 time unit (sN -> sN+1).

1. Step s0 -> s1 (t = 0 → 1) — driver drives truck0 from depot0 to depot1.
   - Action: driver-drive truck0 depot0 → depot1
   - Effects summary: truck0 is no longer at depot0 and is now at depot1.

2. Step s1 -> s2 (t = 1 → 2) — hoist1 lifts crate1 off pallet1 at depot1.
   - Action: hoist-lift-from-pallet hoist1 picks up crate1 from pallet1 at depot1
   - Effects summary: crate1 is held by hoist1; pallet1 becomes clear; hoist1 becomes unavailable.

3. Step s2 -> s3 (t = 2 → 3) — hoist1 loads crate1 into truck0 at depot1.
   - Action: hoist-load hoist1 loads crate1 into truck0 at depot1
   - Effects summary: crate1 is inside truck0; hoist1 becomes free (available).

4. Step s3 -> s4 (t = 3 → 4) — driver drives truck0 from depot1 back to depot0.
   - Action: driver-drive truck0 depot1 → depot0
   - Effects summary: truck0 is no longer at depot1 and is now at depot0.

5. Step s4 -> s5 (t = 4 → 5) — hoist0 unloads crate1 from truck0 at depot0.
   - Action: hoist-unload hoist0 takes crate1 out of truck0 at depot0
   - Effects summary: crate1 is held by hoist0; crate1 is no longer in truck0; hoist0 becomes unavailable.

6. Step s5 -> s6 (t = 5 → 6) — hoist0 drops crate1 onto pallet0 at depot0.
   - Action: hoist-drop-on-pallet hoist0 places crate1 onto pallet0 at depot0
   - Effects summary: crate1 is on pallet0 and is clear; pallet0 is no longer clear; hoist0 becomes free.

7. Step s6 -> s7 (t = 6 → 7) — hoist3 lifts crate2 off crate0 at distributor0.
   - Action: hoist-lift-from-crate hoist3 picks up crate2 from support crate0 at distributor0
   - Effects summary: crate2 is held by hoist3; crate0 becomes clear; hoist3 becomes unavailable.

8. Step s7 -> s8 (t = 7 → 8) — driver drives truck1 from depot0 to distributor0.
   - Action: driver-drive truck1 depot0 → distributor0
   - Effects summary: truck1 is no longer at depot0 and is now at distributor0.

9. Step s8 -> s9 (t = 8 → 9) — hoist3 loads crate2 into truck1 at distributor0.
   - Action: hoist-load hoist3 loads crate2 into truck1 at distributor0
   - Effects summary: crate2 is inside truck1; hoist3 becomes free.

10. Step s9 -> s10 (t = 9 → 10) — hoist3 lifts crate0 from pallet3 at distributor0.
    - Action: hoist-lift-from-pallet hoist3 picks up crate0 from pallet3 at distributor0
    - Effects summary: crate0 is held by hoist3; pallet3 becomes clear; hoist3 becomes unavailable.

11. Step s10 -> s11 (t = 10 → 11) — hoist3 loads crate0 into truck1 at distributor0.
    - Action: hoist-load hoist3 loads crate0 into truck1 at distributor0
    - Effects summary: crate0 is inside truck1; hoist3 becomes free.

12. Step s11 -> s12 (t = 11 → 12) — driver drives truck1 from distributor0 to depot0.
    - Action: driver-drive truck1 distributor0 → depot0
    - Effects summary: truck1 is no longer at distributor0 and is now at depot0.

13. Step s12 -> s13 (t = 12 → 13) — hoist0 unloads crate2 from truck1 at depot0.
    - Action: hoist-unload hoist0 takes crate2 out of truck1 at depot0
    - Effects summary: crate2 is held by hoist0; crate2 is no longer in truck1; hoist0 becomes unavailable.

14. Step s13 -> s14 (t = 13 → 14) — driver drives truck1 from depot0 to depot2.
    - Action: driver-drive truck1 depot0 → depot2
    - Effects summary: truck1 is no longer at depot0 and is now at depot2 (carrying crate0 inside).

15. Step s14 -> s15 (t = 14 → 15) — hoist2 unloads crate0 from truck1 at depot2.
    - Action: hoist-unload hoist2 takes crate0 out of truck1 at depot2
    - Effects summary: crate0 is held by hoist2; crate0 is no longer in truck1; hoist2 becomes unavailable.

16. Step s15 -> s16 (t = 15 → 16) — hoist2 drops crate0 onto pallet2 at depot2.
    - Action: hoist-drop-on-pallet hoist2 places crate0 onto pallet2 at depot2
    - Effects summary: crate0 is on pallet2 and is clear; pallet2 is no longer clear; hoist2 becomes free.

17. Step s16 -> s17 (t = 16 → 17) — hoist0 drops crate2 onto crate1 at depot0.
    - Action: hoist-drop-on-crate hoist0 places crate2 onto crate1 at depot0
    - Effects summary: crate2 is on crate1; crate2 is clear; crate1 is no longer clear; hoist0 becomes free.

Final verification (after s17):
- crate0 is on pallet2 (achieved).
- crate1 is on pallet0 (achieved).
- crate2 is on crate1 (achieved).

All 17 plan steps above follow the given plan exactly (each step corresponds to the listed sN → sN+1 transition) and each action duration is 1 time unit.
