Plan (step-by-step, using stage timestamps s0→s1→... as the discrete time points in the PDDL plan).
Total action cost: 6 (each action consumes one stage step).

1) Time s0 → s1 — hoist-lift-from-pallet(hoist1, crate0, pallet1, depot1)
   - Action: Hoist hoist1 at depot1 lifts crate0 off pallet1.
   - Preconditions satisfied: hoist1 at depot1, crate0 on pallet1 at depot1, crate0 clear, hoist1 free.
   - Effects (after s1):
     - hoist1 is lifting crate0 (hoist-lifting hoist1 crate0).
     - hoist1 is not free (hoist-free hoist1 removed).
     - crate0 is no longer on pallet1 (on-pallet crate0 pallet1 removed) and not recorded at depot1 (at-crate crate0 removed).
     - pallet1 becomes clear (clear-pallet pallet1 added).
   - Duration: 1 stage step (s0→s1).

2) Time s1 → s2 — hoist-lift-from-pallet(hoist2, crate1, pallet2, depot2)
   - Action: Hoist hoist2 at depot2 lifts crate1 off pallet2.
   - Preconditions satisfied: hoist2 at depot2, crate1 on pallet2 at depot2, crate1 clear, hoist2 free.
   - Effects (after s2):
     - hoist2 is lifting crate1.
     - hoist2 is not free.
     - crate1 is no longer on pallet2 and not recorded at depot2.
     - pallet2 becomes clear.
   - Duration: 1 stage step (s1→s2).

3) Time s2 → s3 — hoist-move-lifting(hoist2, crate1, depot2, depot0)
   - Action: While lifting crate1, hoist2 moves from depot2 to depot0 carrying crate1.
   - Preconditions satisfied: hoist2 at depot2 and hoist2 is lifting crate1.
   - Effects (after s3):
     - hoist2 is now at depot0 (hoist-at hoist2 depot0).
     - hoist2 no longer at depot2.
     - crate1 remains lifted by hoist2 (still hoist-lifting hoist2 crate1).
   - Duration: 1 stage step (s2→s3).

4) Time s3 → s4 — hoist-drop-onto-pallet(hoist2, crate1, pallet0, depot0)
   - Action: Hoist hoist2 drops crate1 onto pallet0 at depot0.
   - Preconditions satisfied: hoist2 at depot0, hoist2 lifting crate1, pallet0 at depot0 and clear.
   - Effects (after s4):
     - crate1 is on pallet0 (on-pallet crate1 pallet0).
     - crate1 is at depot0 (at-crate crate1 depot0).
     - hoist2 is no longer lifting crate1 and becomes free (hoist-free hoist2 added).
     - pallet0 is no longer clear.
     - crate1 is clear (clear-crate crate1).
   - Duration: 1 stage step (s3→s4).

5) Time s4 → s5 — hoist-move-lifting(hoist1, crate0, depot1, depot0)
   - Action: While lifting crate0, hoist1 moves from depot1 to depot0 carrying crate0.
   - Preconditions satisfied: hoist1 at depot1 and hoist1 is lifting crate0.
   - Effects (after s5):
     - hoist1 is now at depot0.
     - hoist1 no longer at depot1.
     - crate0 remains lifted by hoist1.
   - Duration: 1 stage step (s4→s5).

6) Time s5 → s6 — hoist-drop-onto-crate(hoist1, crate0, crate1, depot0)
   - Action: Hoist hoist1 drops crate0 onto crate1 at depot0 (stacking crate0 on top of crate1).
   - Preconditions satisfied: hoist1 at depot0, hoist1 lifting crate0, crate1 at depot0 and clear.
   - Effects (after s6):
     - crate0 is on crate1 (on-crate crate0 crate1).
     - crate0 is at depot0 (at-crate crate0 depot0).
     - hoist1 is no longer lifting crate0 and becomes free.
     - crate1 is no longer clear; crate0 is clear.
   - Duration: 1 stage step (s5→s6).

Final state after s6:
- crate0 is on crate1.
- crate1 is on pallet0 (at depot0).
Goal satisfied: (on-crate crate0 crate1) and (on-pallet crate1 pallet0).
