Plan (human-readable, time-indexed). Each action takes one time unit: ph0 = t0, ph1 = t1, etc.

1) t0 → t1 — hoist-lift by hoist3
   - Action: hoist3 lifts crate2 from pallet3 at distributor0.
   - Effects: crate2 is removed from pallet3 and from distributor0; hoist3 becomes busy (lifting crate2) and unavailable; pallet3 becomes clear.

2) t1 → t2 — drive-truck by truck0
   - Action: truck0 drives from distributor0 to depot0.
   - Effects: truck0 is no longer at distributor0 and is now at depot0.

3) t2 → t3 — hoist-load-into-truck by hoist3
   - Action: hoist3 loads the lifted crate2 into truck2 at distributor0.
   - Preconditions satisfied: truck2 is at distributor0 and hoist3 is lifting crate2.
   - Effects: crate2 is now in truck2; hoist3 becomes available and is no longer lifting crate2.

4) t3 → t4 — drive-truck by truck2
   - Action: truck2 drives from distributor0 to depot0 (carrying crate2).
   - Effects: truck2 is now at depot0 (crate2 remains in truck2).

5) t4 → t5 — hoist-lift by hoist0
   - Action: hoist0 lifts crate1 from on top of crate0 at depot0.
   - Preconditions: hoist0 at depot0, crate1 is clear and on crate0.
   - Effects: crate1 is removed from crate0 and from depot0; hoist0 becomes busy (lifting crate1) and unavailable; crate0 becomes clear.

6) t5 → t6 — hoist-load-into-truck by hoist0
   - Action: hoist0 loads the lifted crate1 into truck0 at depot0.
   - Preconditions: truck0 is at depot0 and hoist0 is lifting crate1.
   - Effects: crate1 is now in truck0; hoist0 becomes available and stops lifting crate1.

7) t6 → t7 — hoist-lift by hoist0
   - Action: hoist0 lifts crate0 from pallet0 at depot0.
   - Preconditions: crate0 is clear (crate1 was removed) and pallet0 is at depot0; hoist0 at depot0 and available.
   - Effects: crate0 is removed from pallet0 and from depot0; hoist0 becomes busy (lifting crate0) and unavailable; pallet0 becomes clear.

8) t7 → t8 — hoist-load-into-truck by hoist0
   - Action: hoist0 loads the lifted crate0 into truck0 at depot0.
   - Preconditions: truck0 is at depot0 and hoist0 is lifting crate0.
   - Effects: crate0 is now in truck0 (truck0 now contains crate1 and crate0); hoist0 becomes available and stops lifting crate0.

9) t8 → t9 — drive-truck by truck0
   - Action: truck0 drives from depot0 to depot2 (carrying crate1 and crate0).
   - Effects: truck0 is now at depot2 with both crates inside.

10) t9 → t10 — hoist-unload-from-truck by hoist2
    - Action: hoist2 (at depot2) unloads crate0 from truck0 (hoist2 takes crate0 into its grip).
    - Preconditions: hoist2 at depot2, truck0 at depot2, hoist2 available, crate0 in truck0.
    - Effects: crate0 is removed from truck0 and hoist2 becomes busy (lifting crate0) and unavailable.

11) t10 → t11 — hoist-unload-from-truck by hoist0
    - Action: hoist0 (at depot0) unloads crate2 from truck2 at depot0 (hoist0 takes crate2 into its grip).
    - Preconditions: hoist0 at depot0 and available, truck2 at depot0, crate2 in truck2.
    - Effects: crate2 is removed from truck2 and hoist0 becomes busy (lifting crate2) and unavailable.

12) t11 → t12 — hoist-drop-to-surface by hoist0
    - Action: hoist0 drops the lifted crate2 onto pallet0 at depot0.
    - Preconditions: hoist0 is lifting crate2, pallet0 at depot0 and clear.
    - Effects: crate2 is placed on pallet0 at depot0; hoist0 becomes available and stops lifting; pallet0 becomes not clear; crate2 is clear.

13) t12 → t13 — hoist-drop-to-surface by hoist2
    - Action: hoist2 drops the lifted crate0 onto pallet2 at depot2.
    - Preconditions: hoist2 is lifting crate0, pallet2 is at depot2 and clear.
    - Effects: crate0 is placed on pallet2 at depot2; hoist2 becomes available and stops lifting; pallet2 becomes not clear; crate0 is clear.

14) t13 → t14 — hoist-unload-from-truck by hoist2
    - Action: hoist2 (at depot2 and now available) unloads crate1 from truck0 at depot2 (hoist2 takes crate1 into its grip).
    - Preconditions: hoist2 at depot2, truck0 at depot2, hoist2 available, crate1 in truck0.
    - Effects: crate1 is removed from truck0 and hoist2 becomes busy (lifting crate1) and unavailable.

15) t14 → t15 — hoist-drop-to-surface by hoist2
    - Action: hoist2 drops the lifted crate1 onto crate0 at depot2.
    - Preconditions: hoist2 is lifting crate1, crate0 is at depot2 and clear.
    - Effects: crate1 is placed on crate0 at depot2; hoist2 becomes available and stops lifting; crate0 becomes not clear; crate1 is clear.

Result (after t15):
- crate0 is on pallet2 (depot2).
- crate1 is on crate0 (depot2).
- crate2 is on pallet0 (depot0).

This sequence follows the provided plan exactly (15 actions, each between consecutive phases ph0→ph15) and achieves the global goal.
