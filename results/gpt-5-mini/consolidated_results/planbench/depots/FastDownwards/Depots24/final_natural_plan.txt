Summary: the plan executes 17 actions. Each action consumes the current stage token and advances to its successor (s0→s1→...→s17). For readability each action is shown with its stage timestamp (t0 = s0, t1 = s1, ...), an assumed duration of 1 time unit per action (unit cost), the action name and parameters, the key preconditions that must hold when the action starts, and the immediate effects produced.

1) Time t0 → t1 (s0 → s1), duration 1
   Action: driver-drive(truck1, depot0 → depot2)
   Preconditions: truck1 is at depot0; depot0 connected to depot2; current stage = s0.
   Effects: truck1 is now at depot2 (no longer at depot0); current stage becomes s1.

2) Time t1 → t2 (s1 → s2), duration 1
   Action: hoist-lift(hoist0, crate0, from pallet0 at depot0)
   Preconditions: hoist0 at depot0 and available; pallet0 at depot0; crate0 is on pallet0 and clear; current stage = s1.
   Effects: hoist0 is no longer available and is lifting crate0; crate0 is removed from pallet0 (no longer on pallet0, not at-surface); pallet0 becomes clear; current stage becomes s2.

3) Time t2 → t3 (s2 → s3), duration 1
   Action: hoist-lift(hoist3, crate1, from pallet3 at distributor0)
   Preconditions: hoist3 at distributor0 and available; pallet3 at distributor0; crate1 is on pallet3 and clear; current stage = s2.
   Effects: hoist3 is lifting crate1 and becomes not available; crate1 removed from pallet3; pallet3 becomes clear; current stage becomes s3.

4) Time t3 → t4 (s3 → s4), duration 1
   Action: hoist-lift(hoist2, crate2, from pallet2 at depot2)
   Preconditions: hoist2 at depot2 and available; pallet2 at depot2; crate2 on pallet2 and clear; current stage = s3.
   Effects: hoist2 lifts crate2 and becomes not available; crate2 removed from pallet2 (not at-surface); pallet2 becomes clear; current stage becomes s4.

5) Time t4 → t5 (s4 → s5), duration 1
   Action: driver-drive(truck0, depot2 → depot0)
   Preconditions: truck0 at depot2; depot2 connected to depot0; current stage = s4.
   Effects: truck0 is now at depot0 (no longer at depot2); current stage becomes s5.

6) Time t5 → t6 (s5 → s6), duration 1
   Action: hoist-load(hoist0, crate0 → into truck0 at depot0)
   Preconditions: hoist0 at depot0 and currently lifting crate0; truck0 at depot0; current stage = s5.
   Effects: crate0 becomes in-truck truck0 (no longer lifted by hoist0 or on any surface); hoist0 becomes available; current stage becomes s6.

7) Time t6 → t7 (s6 → s7), duration 1
   Action: hoist-load(hoist2, crate2 → into truck1 at depot2)
   Preconditions: hoist2 at depot2 and currently lifting crate2; truck1 at depot2; current stage = s6.
   Effects: crate2 becomes in-truck truck1; hoist2 becomes available; current stage becomes s7.

8) Time t7 → t8 (s7 → s8), duration 1
   Action: driver-drive(truck1, depot2 → depot0)
   Preconditions: truck1 at depot2; depot2 connected to depot0; current stage = s7.
   Effects: truck1 is now at depot0 (carrying crate2); current stage becomes s8.

9) Time t8 → t9 (s8 → s9), duration 1
   Action: hoist-unload(hoist0, crate2, from truck1 at depot0)
   Preconditions: hoist0 at depot0 and available; truck1 at depot0; crate2 is in truck1; current stage = s8.
   Effects: crate2 is removed from truck1 and becomes lifted by hoist0 (lifting(hoist0, crate2)); hoist0 becomes not available; crate2 is not at any surface while lifted; current stage becomes s9.

10) Time t9 → t10 (s9 → s10), duration 1
    Action: hoist-drop(hoist0, crate2 → onto pallet0 at depot0)
    Preconditions: hoist0 at depot0 and lifting crate2; pallet0 is at depot0 and currently clear; current stage = s9.
    Effects: crate2 is placed on pallet0 at depot0 (on(crate2, pallet0), at-surface(crate2, depot0)); pallet0 becomes not clear; crate2 becomes clear (topmost); hoist0 stops lifting crate2 and becomes available; current stage becomes s10.

11) Time t10 → t11 (s10 → s11), duration 1
    Action: hoist-unload(hoist0, crate0, from truck0 at depot0)
    Preconditions: hoist0 at depot0 and available; truck0 at depot0; crate0 is in truck0; current stage = s10.
    Effects: crate0 removed from truck0 and becomes lifted by hoist0 (lifting(hoist0, crate0)); hoist0 becomes not available; crate0 not at any surface while lifted; current stage becomes s11.

12) Time t11 → t12 (s11 → s12), duration 1
    Action: hoist-drop(hoist0, crate0 → onto crate2 at depot0)
    Preconditions: hoist0 at depot0 and lifting crate0; crate2 is at-surface at depot0 and clear (topmost); current stage = s11.
    Effects: crate0 is placed on crate2 (on(crate0, crate2), at-surface(crate0, depot0)); crate0 becomes clear; crate2 becomes not clear; hoist0 stops lifting crate0 and becomes available; current stage becomes s12.

13) Time t12 → t13 (s12 → s13), duration 1
    Action: driver-drive(truck2, depot2 → distributor0)
    Preconditions: truck2 at depot2; depot2 connected to distributor0; current stage = s12.
    Effects: truck2 now at distributor0; current stage becomes s13.

14) Time t13 → t14 (s13 → s14), duration 1
    Action: hoist-load(hoist3, crate1 → into truck2 at distributor0)
    Preconditions: hoist3 at distributor0 and currently lifting crate1; truck2 at distributor0; current stage = s13.
    Effects: crate1 becomes in-truck truck2; hoist3 stops lifting and becomes available; current stage becomes s14.

15) Time t14 → t15 (s14 → s15), duration 1
    Action: driver-drive(truck2, distributor0 → depot2)
    Preconditions: truck2 at distributor0; distributor0 connected to depot2; current stage = s14.
    Effects: truck2 now at depot2 (carrying crate1); current stage becomes s15.

16) Time t15 → t16 (s15 → s16), duration 1
    Action: hoist-unload(hoist2, crate1, from truck2 at depot2)
    Preconditions: hoist2 at depot2 and available; truck2 at depot2; crate1 is in truck2; current stage = s15.
    Effects: crate1 is removed from truck2 and becomes lifted by hoist2; hoist2 becomes not available; crate1 not at any surface while lifted; current stage becomes s16.

17) Time t16 → t17 (s16 → s17), duration 1
    Action: hoist-drop(hoist2, crate1 → onto pallet2 at depot2)
    Preconditions: hoist2 at depot2 and lifting crate1; pallet2 at depot2 and clear; current stage = s16.
    Effects: crate1 placed on pallet2 at depot2 (on(crate1, pallet2), at-surface(crate1, depot2)); pallet2 becomes not clear; crate1 becomes clear; hoist2 becomes available; current stage becomes s17.

Result after step 17 (t17 / s17): goal satisfied
 - on(crate0, crate2) — crate0 is on crate2 at depot0 (from step 12)
 - on(crate1, pallet2) — crate1 is on pallet2 at depot2 (from step 17)
 - on(crate2, pallet0) — crate2 is on pallet0 at depot0 (from step 10)

Total cost: 17 (17 actions × 1 time unit each).
