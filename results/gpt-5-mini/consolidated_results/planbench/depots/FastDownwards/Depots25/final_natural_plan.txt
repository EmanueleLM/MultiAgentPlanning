Plan (human-readable, step-by-step). Each step matches the given plan action and lists the time interval and the main effects.

Initial time = t0.

1) t0 → t1 — truck_coordinator-drive truck0 distributor0 → depot2
   - Action: Drive truck0 from distributor0 to depot2.
   - Effect at t1: truck0 is at depot2.

2) t1 → t2 — hoist_manager-lift hoist2 lifts crate2 from surface crate1 at depot2
   - Action: hoist2 (at depot2) lifts crate2 off the supporting surface crate1.
   - Effects at t2: hoist2 is holding crate2; crate2 is no longer on crate1 and is not at-surface at depot2; hoist2 becomes busy (no longer free); crate1 becomes clear (top).

3) t2 → t3 — hoist_manager-load hoist2 loads crate2 into truck0 at depot2
   - Action: hoist2 loads the held crate2 into truck0 (truck0 is at depot2).
   - Effects at t3: crate2 is in-truck truck0; hoist2 becomes free; crate2 remains removed from any at-surface facts at depot2.

4) t3 → t4 — hoist_manager-lift hoist2 lifts crate1 from surface crate0 at depot2
   - Action: hoist2 (at depot2) lifts crate1 off crate0.
   - Effects at t4: hoist2 is holding crate1; crate1 is no longer on crate0 and is not at-surface at depot2; hoist2 becomes busy; crate0 becomes clear.

5) t4 → t5 — hoist_manager-load hoist2 loads crate1 into truck0 at depot2
   - Action: hoist2 loads the held crate1 into truck0.
   - Effects at t5: crate1 is in-truck truck0; hoist2 becomes free.

6) t5 → t6 — hoist_manager-lift hoist2 lifts crate0 from pallet2 at depot2
   - Action: hoist2 lifts crate0 off pallet2.
   - Effects at t6: hoist2 is holding crate0; crate0 is no longer on pallet2 and is not at-surface at depot2; hoist2 becomes busy; pallet2 becomes clear (temporarily).

7) t6 → t7 — hoist_manager-load hoist2 loads crate0 into truck0 at depot2
   - Action: hoist2 loads the held crate0 into truck0.
   - Effects at t7: crate0 is in-truck truck0; hoist2 becomes free.

8) t7 → t8 — hoist_manager-unload hoist2 unloads crate2 from truck0 at depot2
   - Action: hoist2 unloads crate2 from truck0 (truck0 at depot2).
   - Effects at t8: hoist2 is holding crate2; crate2 is removed from truck0 (no longer in-truck); hoist2 becomes busy.

9) t8 → t9 — hoist_manager-drop hoist2 drops crate2 onto pallet2 at depot2
   - Action: hoist2 places crate2 onto pallet2 at depot2.
   - Effects at t9: crate2 is on pallet2; crate2 is clear (top); pallet2 becomes not clear; hoist2 becomes free.

10) t9 → t10 — hoist_manager-unload hoist2 unloads crate1 from truck0 at depot2
    - Action: hoist2 unloads crate1 from truck0.
    - Effects at t10: hoist2 is holding crate1; crate1 is removed from truck0 (no longer in-truck); hoist2 becomes busy.

11) t10 → t11 — hoist_manager-drop hoist2 drops crate1 onto crate2 at depot2
    - Action: hoist2 places crate1 onto crate2 (crate2 is on pallet2).
    - Effects at t11: crate1 is on crate2; hoist2 becomes free.

Final state (at t11): 
- on(crate1, crate2) — crate1 on crate2 (satisfied).
- on(crate2, pallet2) — crate2 on pallet2 (satisfied).

Total actions: 11 (final goal achieved at time t11).
