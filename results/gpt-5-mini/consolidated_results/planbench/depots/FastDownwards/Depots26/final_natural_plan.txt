Below is a clear, step-by-step human-readable trace of the provided plan. Each step corresponds exactly to one action in the plan, in the same order, and shows the timestamp (stage) transition, the actor, the required preconditions (as they were satisfied at that moment), and the effects produced. Each action advances the global stage by one successor (duration = 1 stage).

Final state (after s15) — goal verification:
- (on crate0 pallet2) — achieved at step 5
- (on crate1 pallet3) — achieved at step 15
- (on crate2 pallet1) — achieved at step 14

All actions above follow the specified preconditions and effects for hoist and truck actions, maintain explicit resource predicates (hoist-available, hoist-holding, in-truck, clear, on, surface-at, truck-at, hoist-at), and advance the discrete stage timestamp by one at each step. The goal configuration is satisfied exactly as required.
