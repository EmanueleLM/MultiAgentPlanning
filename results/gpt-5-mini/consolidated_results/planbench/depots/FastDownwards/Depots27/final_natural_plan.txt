1) (hoist-lift hoist0 crate1 crate0 depot0 stage0 stage1) — time 0 → 1 (duration 1)
- Action: Hoist hoist0 at depot0 lifts crate1 from the surface crate0 (crate1 was on crate0).
- Preconditions (satisfied at time 0): hoist0 is at depot0 and available; crate0 (the supporting surface) is at depot0; crate1 is on crate0 and crate1 is clear.
- Effects (after time 1): crate1 is no longer on crate0 and no longer recorded at the place; hoist0 is now lifting crate1 and becomes unavailable; the supporting surface crate0 becomes clear.

2) (hoist-load hoist0 crate1 truck0 depot0 stage1 stage2) — time 1 → 2 (duration 1)
- Action: Hoist hoist0 loads the currently lifted crate1 into truck0 at depot0.
- Preconditions (at time 1): hoist0 is at depot0 and currently lifting crate1; truck0 is at depot0.
- Effects (after time 2): crate1 is now in-truck truck0; hoist0 becomes available again and is no longer lifting crate1; crate1 is no longer recorded as located at depot0.

3) (hoist-lift hoist0 crate0 pallet0 depot0 stage2 stage3) — time 2 → 3 (duration 1)
- Action: Hoist hoist0 lifts crate0 from pallet0 at depot0.
- Preconditions (at time 2): hoist0 is at depot0 and available; pallet0 is at depot0; crate0 is on pallet0 and crate0 is clear (crate1 was previously removed so crate0 was clear).
- Effects (after time 3): crate0 is removed from pallet0 and removed from place-location; hoist0 is now lifting crate0 and becomes unavailable; pallet0 becomes clear.

4) (hoist-load hoist0 crate0 truck0 depot0 stage3 stage4) — time 3 → 4 (duration 1)
- Action: Hoist hoist0 loads the currently lifted crate0 into truck0 at depot0.
- Preconditions (at time 3): hoist0 is at depot0 and lifting crate0; truck0 is at depot0.
- Effects (after time 4): crate0 is now in-truck truck0; hoist0 becomes available and stops lifting crate0; crate0 is no longer recorded as at depot0.

5) (hoist-unload hoist0 crate1 truck0 depot0 stage4 stage5) — time 4 → 5 (duration 1)
- Action: Hoist hoist0 unloads crate1 from truck0 at depot0 (hoist0 takes crate1 out of the truck and lifts it).
- Preconditions (at time 4): hoist0 is at depot0 and available; truck0 is at depot0; crate1 is in-truck truck0.
- Effects (after time 5): crate1 is removed from the truck (no longer in-truck); hoist0 begins lifting crate1 and becomes unavailable. Crate1 is now in the hoist's lifting state (not yet placed on any surface).

6) (drive-truck truck0 depot0 distributor0 stage5 stage6) — time 5 → 6 (duration 1)
- Action: Truck driver drives truck0 from depot0 to distributor0.
- Preconditions (at time 5): truck0 is at depot0; current stage advances from stage5 to stage6.
- Effects (after time 6): truck0 is now at distributor0 (no longer at depot0). Any crate(s) remaining in-truck move with the truck (crate0 is in-truck and thus now at distributor0 inside truck0).

7) (hoist-unload hoist3 crate0 truck0 distributor0 stage6 stage7) — time 6 → 7 (duration 1)
- Action: Hoist hoist3 (at distributor0) unloads crate0 from truck0 at distributor0 (hoist3 takes crate0 out of truck0 and lifts it).
- Preconditions (at time 6): hoist3 is at distributor0 and available; truck0 is at distributor0; crate0 is in-truck truck0.
- Effects (after time 7): crate0 is removed from the truck and hoist3 is now lifting crate0 and becomes unavailable. Crate0 is in the hoist3 lifting state (not yet placed on any surface).

8) (hoist-drop hoist3 crate0 pallet3 distributor0 stage7 stage8) — time 7 → 8 (duration 1)
- Action: Hoist hoist3 drops crate0 onto pallet3 at distributor0.
- Preconditions (at time 7): hoist3 is at distributor0 and lifting crate0; pallet3 is at distributor0 and is clear.
- Effects (after time 8): hoist3 becomes available and stops lifting crate0; crate0 is now at distributor0 and placed on pallet3 (crate0 on pallet3); pallet3 is no longer clear; crate0 becomes clear (top-most).

9) (hoist-drop hoist0 crate1 pallet0 depot0 stage8 stage9) — time 8 → 9 (duration 1)
- Action: Hoist hoist0 (at depot0) drops crate1 onto pallet0 at depot0.
- Preconditions (at time 8): hoist0 is at depot0 and is lifting crate1 (from step 5); pallet0 is at depot0 and was made clear earlier when crate0 was lifted; pallet0 remains clear.
- Effects (after time 9): hoist0 becomes available and stops lifting crate1; crate1 is now at depot0 and placed on pallet0 (crate1 on pallet0); pallet0 is no longer clear; crate1 becomes clear.

Final state (after time 9)
- Goal achieved: crate0 is on pallet3 (at distributor0) and crate1 is on pallet0 (at depot0).
- Total plan cost (number of actions): 9 (each action consumed one stage step).
