Summary assumptions: each action in the plan has unit cost and is executed sequentially. I report start and end timestamps in integer time units, starting at t=0. Each step lists the actor, objects involved, location, the key preconditions that are used, and the main effects that result from the action (focused on predicates from the specification: at, on, in-truck, available, lifting, clear, stage).

1) Time [t=0 → t=1] — hoist-lift-from-surface(hoist0, crate2, crate1, depot0, s_on_surface → s_lifted)
- Action: hoist0 (at depot0) lifts crate2 from the surface crate1 (crate2 was on crate1 at depot0).
- Key preconditions used: hoist0 at depot0; crate2 and crate1 at depot0; crate2 is on crate1; crate2 is clear; hoist0 available; stage(crate2)=s_on_surface; next(s_on_surface,s_lifted).
- Main effects: crate2 is removed from on(crate1) and from the place (no longer on crate1, not at depot0); hoist0 becomes not available and starts lifting crate2 (lifting hoist0 crate2); crate1 (the surface) becomes clear; stage(crate2) advances to s_lifted.

2) Time [t=1 → t=2] — hoist-load-into-truck(hoist0, truck0, crate2, depot0, s_lifted → s_in_truck)
- Action: hoist0 (at depot0, lifting crate2) loads crate2 into truck0 (co-located at depot0).
- Key preconditions used: hoist0 at depot0; truck0 at depot0; hoist0 lifting crate2; stage(crate2)=s_lifted; next(s_lifted,s_in_truck).
- Main effects: crate2 becomes in-truck truck0 (in-truck crate2 truck0); hoist0 becomes available and stops lifting; crate2 is not at the place while inside the truck; stage(crate2) advances to s_in_truck.

3) Time [t=2 → t=3] — drive(truck0, depot0 → depot2)
- Action: truck0 drives from depot0 to depot2 carrying crate2 inside.
- Key preconditions used: truck0 at depot0.
- Main effects: truck0 is at depot2 and no longer at depot0. (Crate2 remains in-truck and therefore not at any place.)

4) Time [t=3 → t=4] — hoist-unload-from-truck(hoist2, truck0, crate2, depot2, s_in_truck → s_lifted_from_truck)
- Action: hoist2 (at depot2) unloads crate2 from truck0.
- Key preconditions used: hoist2 at depot2; truck0 at depot2; hoist2 available; in-truck crate2 truck0; stage(crate2)=s_in_truck; next(s_in_truck,s_lifted_from_truck).
- Main effects: crate2 removed from truck0 (no longer in-truck); hoist2 becomes not available and begins lifting crate2 (lifting hoist2 crate2); crate2 is not yet at the place while being lifted; stage(crate2) advances to s_lifted_from_truck.

5) Time [t=4 → t=5] — hoist-drop-to-surface(hoist2, crate2, pallet2, depot2, s_lifted_from_truck → s_placed)
- Action: hoist2 (at depot2, lifting crate2) drops crate2 onto pallet2 at depot2.
- Key preconditions used: hoist2 at depot2; pallet2 at depot2; hoist2 lifting crate2; pallet2 clear; target-pallet(crate2)=pallet2 is implied in the domain (goal-targeting action used in plan); stage(crate2)=s_lifted_from_truck; next(s_lifted_from_truck,s_placed).
- Main effects: hoist2 becomes available and stops lifting; crate2 is placed on pallet2 (on crate2 pallet2) and at depot2; pallet2 becomes not clear; crate2 becomes clear; stage(crate2) advances to s_placed.

6) Time [t=5 → t=6] — hoist-lift-from-surface(hoist0, crate1, pallet0, depot0, s_on_surface → s_lifted)
- Action: hoist0 (back at depot0 and available) lifts crate1 from pallet0 at depot0.
- Key preconditions used: hoist0 at depot0; pallet0 at depot0; crate1 on pallet0; crate1 at depot0; crate1 clear; hoist0 available; stage(crate1)=s_on_surface; next(s_on_surface,s_lifted).
- Main effects: crate1 removed from pallet0 and from the place; hoist0 becomes not available and starts lifting crate1; pallet0 becomes clear; stage(crate1) advances to s_lifted.

7) Time [t=6 → t=7] — drive(truck1, depot1 → depot0)
- Action: truck1 drives from depot1 to depot0 (empty initially) to pick up crate1.
- Key preconditions used: truck1 at depot1.
- Main effects: truck1 is at depot0 and no longer at depot1.

8) Time [t=7 → t=8] — hoist-load-into-truck(hoist0, truck1, crate1, depot0, s_lifted → s_in_truck)
- Action: hoist0 (at depot0 lifting crate1) loads crate1 into truck1 (now at depot0).
- Key preconditions used: hoist0 at depot0; truck1 at depot0; hoist0 lifting crate1; stage(crate1)=s_lifted; next(s_lifted,s_in_truck).
- Main effects: crate1 becomes in-truck truck1; hoist0 becomes available and stops lifting; crate1 is not at the place while inside the truck; stage(crate1) advances to s_in_truck.

9) Time [t=8 → t=9] — drive(truck1, depot0 → depot1)
- Action: truck1 drives from depot0 back to depot1 carrying crate1 inside.
- Key preconditions used: truck1 at depot0.
- Main effects: truck1 is at depot1 and no longer at depot0. (crate1 remains in-truck)

10) Time [t=9 → t=10] — hoist-unload-from-truck(hoist1, truck1, crate1, depot1, s_in_truck → s_lifted_from_truck)
- Action: hoist1 (at depot1) unloads crate1 from truck1.
- Key preconditions used: hoist1 at depot1; truck1 at depot1; hoist1 available; in-truck crate1 truck1; stage(crate1)=s_in_truck; next(s_in_truck,s_lifted_from_truck).
- Main effects: crate1 removed from truck1 (no longer in-truck); hoist1 becomes not available and begins lifting crate1; crate1 is not at the place while being lifted; stage(crate1) advances to s_lifted_from_truck.

11) Time [t=10 → t=11] — hoist-drop-to-surface(hoist1, crate1, pallet1, depot1, s_lifted_from_truck → s_placed)
- Action: hoist1 (at depot1 lifting crate1) drops crate1 onto pallet1 at depot1.
- Key preconditions used: hoist1 at depot1; pallet1 at depot1; hoist1 lifting crate1; pallet1 clear; target-pallet(crate1)=pallet1; stage(crate1)=s_lifted_from_truck; next(s_lifted_from_truck,s_placed).
- Main effects: hoist1 becomes available and stops lifting; crate1 is placed on pallet1 (on crate1 pallet1) and at depot1; pallet1 becomes not clear; crate1 becomes clear; stage(crate1) advances to s_placed.

Final achieved state at t=11 (goal conditions satisfied):
- on(crate1, pallet1) and stage(crate1)=s_placed
- on(crate2, pallet2) and stage(crate2)=s_placed

Total plan cost: 11 (one unit per action).
