Plan (22 steps). Each step shows a timestamp (t = step index, 1.0 time unit per step), the action (with arguments as in the plan), a short note of required preconditions (when helpful), and the concrete effect on the relevant predicates (what is added and what is removed). Object names are left as given (object_0 .. object_14).

Final result (after t=21.0):
- The goal predicates are achieved:
  - (next object_11 object_9) — added at Step 7.
  - (next object_12 object_8) — added at Step 22.
  - (next object_13 object_5) — added at Step 14.
  - (next object_14 object_7) — added at Step 19.

Notes:
- Each action above is exactly the corresponding PDDL step in the supplied plan and appears in the same order.
- I used 1.0 time unit per action for timestamps (t = 0.0, 1.0, ..., 21.0) to indicate a simple, uniform duration schedule.
