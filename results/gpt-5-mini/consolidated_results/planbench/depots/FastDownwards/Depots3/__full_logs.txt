PROBLEM
------------------------------
I have to plan the logistics of transporting crates between a number of depots and distributors via trucks that are loaded by hoists. Depots and distributors are directly connected by roads (trucks can drive between any two depots or distributors).

A depot is a type of place.
A distributor is a type of place.
A pallet is a type of surface.
A crate is a type of surface.

Here are the actions that can be performed:

Drive a truck from one place to another place.
Use a hoist to lift a crate from a surface at a place.
Use a hoist to drop a crate to a surface at a place.
Use a hoist to load a crate into a truck at a place.
Use a hoist to unload a crate from a truck at a place.

The following are the restrictions on the actions:
A truck can be driven from one place to another place only if the truck is at the origin place.
Once a truck has been driven from one place to another, it is not at the origin place and is at the destination place.
A crate can be lifted by a hoist only if the hoist is at the same place as the crate, the hoist is available, and the crate is clear.
Once a crate has been lifted by a hoist from a surface at a place, the crate is not at the place, the hoist is lifting the crate, the hoist is not available, the surface is clear, and the crate is not on the surface.
A crate can be dropped by a hoist to a surface only if the hoist and surface are both at the place, the surface is clear, and the hoist is lifting the crate.
Once a crate has been dropped by a hoist to a surface at a place, the hoist is available, the hoist is not lifting the crate, the crate is at the place, the surface is not clear, the crate is clear, and the crate is on the surface.
A crate can be loaded by a hoist onto a truck at a place only if the hoist is at the same place, the truck is at the same place, and the hoist is lifting the crate.
Once a crate has been loaded by a hoist onto a truck at a place, 
A crate can be unloaded by a hoist from a truck at a place only if the hoist is at the same place as the truck, the hoist is available, and the crate is in the truck.
Once a crate has been unloaded by a hoist from a truck at a place, the crate is not in the truck, the hoist is not available, and the hoist is lifting the crate.

[STATEMENT]
As initial conditions I have that, crate0 is at depot1, crate1 is at depot1, crate2 is at depot0, hoist0 is at depot0, hoist1 is at depot1, hoist2 is at depot2, hoist3 is at distributor0, pallet0 is at depot0, pallet1 is at depot1, pallet2 is at depot2, pallet3 is at distributor0, truck0 is at depot1, truck1 is at depot1, truck2 is at distributor0, hoist0 is available, hoist1 is available, hoist2 is available, hoist3 is available, crate1 is clear, crate2 is clear, pallet2 is clear, pallet3 is clear, crate0 is on pallet1, crate1 is on crate0 and crate2 is on pallet0.
My goal is to have that crate1 is on pallet1 and crate2 is on pallet3.

My plan is as follows:

PROBLEM
------------------------------
I have to plan the logistics of transporting crates between a number of depots and distributors via trucks that are loaded by hoists. Depots and distributors are directly connected by roads (trucks can drive between any two depots or distributors).

A depot is a type of place.
A distributor is a type of place.
A pallet is a type of surface.
A crate is a type of surface.

Here are the actions that can be performed:

Drive a truck from one place to another place.
Use a hoist to lift a crate from a surface at a place.
Use a hoist to drop a crate to a surface at a place.
Use a hoist to load a crate into a truck at a place.
Use a hoist to unload a crate from a truck at a place.

The following are the restrictions on the actions:
A truck can be driven from one place to another place only if the truck is at the origin place.
Once a truck has been driven from one place to another, it is not at the origin place and is at the destination place.

My goal is to have that crate0 is on pallet3, crate1 is on pallet0 and crate2 is on crate0.

My plan is as follows:

[PLAN]
================================================================================


ENVIRONMENT
------------------------------
I have to plan the logistics of transporting crates between a number of depots and distributors via trucks that are loaded by hoists. Depots and distributors are directly connected by roads (trucks can drive between any two depots or distributors).

A depot is a type of place.
A distributor is a type of place.
A pallet is a type of surface.
A crate is a type of surface.

Here are the actions that can be performed:

Drive a truck from one place to another place.
Use a hoist to lift a crate from a surface at a place.
Use a hoist to drop a crate to a surface at a place.
Use a hoist to load a crate into a truck at a place.
Use a hoist to unload a crate from a truck at a place.

The following are the restrictions on the actions:
A truck can be driven from one place to another place only if the truck is at the origin place.
Once a truck has been driven from one place to another, it is not at the origin place and is at the destination place.
A crate can be lifted by a hoist only if the hoist is at the same place as the crate, the hoist is available, and the crate is clear.
Once a crate has been lifted by a hoist from a surface at a place, the crate is not at the place, the hoist is lifting the crate, the hoist is not available, the surface is clear, and the crate is not on the surface.
A crate can be dropped by a hoist to a surface only if the hoist and surface are both at the place, the surface is clear, and the hoist is lifting the crate.
Once a crate has been dropped by a hoist to a surface at a place, the hoist is available, the hoist is not lifting the crate, the crate is at the place, the surface is not clear, the crate is clear, and the crate is on the surface.
A crate can be loaded by a hoist onto a truck at a place only if the hoist is at the same place, the truck is at the same place, and the hoist is lifting the crate.
Once a crate has been loaded by a hoist onto a truck at a place, 
A crate can be unloaded by a hoist from a truck at a place only if the hoist is at the same place as the truck, the hoist is available, and the crate is in the truck.
Once a crate has been unloaded by a hoist from a truck at a place, the crate is not in the truck, the hoist is not available, and the hoist is lifting the crate.

[STATEMENT]
As initial conditions I have that, crate0 is at depot0, crate1 is at depot0, crate2 is at depot2, hoist0 is at depot0, hoist1 is at depot1, hoist2 is at depot2, hoist3 is at distributor0, pallet0 is at depot0, pallet1 is at depot1, pallet2 is at depot2, pallet3 is at distributor0, truck0 is at depot0, truck1 is at depot1, truck2 is at depot0, hoist0 is available, hoist1 is available, hoist2 is available, hoist3 is available, crate1 is clear, crate2 is clear, pallet1 is clear, pallet3 is clear, crate0 is on pallet0, crate1 is on crate0 and crate2 is on pallet2.
My goal is to have that crate0 is on pallet3, crate1 is on pallet0 and crate2 is on crate0.

My plan is as follows:

FINAL-PLAN
------------------------------
I can produce the requested combined multi-agent PDDL domain and problem for FastDownward, but I don't have the required inputs (loader_spec, driver_spec, and audit_report) in your last message. I need those specifications to derive the exact actions, agents, places, surfaces, initial state, and goals. Please paste or describe them. To avoid rework, provide as much of the following concrete information as possible (items marked required):

Required inputs (please provide exactly what applies; do not assume I will invent anything):
- Agent identifiers and types (e.g., loader L1, hoist H1, driver D1, truck T1). Indicate which agents are loaders, hoists, drivers, trucks, etc.
- Places (named locations) and surfaces (e.g., dock, yard, platform, pallet_A). For each place/surface give a unique name and type.
- Which agents are capable of which actions (e.g., loader L1 can load from surface S1 to truck T1; hoist H1 can lift from surface S2 to surface S3; driver D1 can drive truck T1 between places P1 and P2).
- Initial positions: where each agent, truck, and object/surface currently is (e.g., truck T1 at location yard_1, hoist H1 at platform_2, pallet_A on surface S1).
- Items/loads to move (if any): unique names and initial surfaces, and required final surfaces/places.
- Any discrete phases, ordered sequences, or time slots that must be enforced explicitly (e.g., “phase1 then phase2”, or “day1 → day2 → day3”). If present, provide the exact ordered list.
- Hard constraints and preferences to encode as strict constraints (every natural-language preference should be treated as a strict constraint). Examples: “truck must not enter yard_2”, “hoist must finish loading before driver can depart”, “exactly one truck per transfer”, “at most two loads on a surface at any time”, “operations must occur within slot1 followed by slot2”. Specify them precisely.
- Any forbidden actions or explicit orderings from the auditor (audit_report) — e.g., "driver must inspect load before departure", "no simultaneous lifting by two hoists on same load", "exactly this inspection step required", etc.
- Final goals: every mandated terminal condition that must be true in the goal state (e.g., pallet_A at place_B, hoist H1 returned to home, driver D1 at depot, load inspected and signed off). Be explicit.

Optional but helpful:
- Whether action costs are needed (and if so, what cost model). Note: you asked to avoid :cost on action headers; I can include (increase ...) effects if required.
- Counts or capacities (e.g., truck capacity n, surface capacity m) — if these exist, give numbers.
- Any required typed names (if you prefer specific type labels different from "truck", "hoist", "place", "surface", "agent").

How I'll encode it once you provide the specs:
- A single PDDL domain enclosed in <domain>...</domain>, with :requirements only from { :strips, :typing, :negative-preconditions } (and :action-costs only if you request cost effects then I will include matching increase effects).
- A single PDDL problem enclosed in <problem>...</problem> that fully enumerates objects, the complete initial state, and the goal conditions. I will not invent any objects or actions beyond what you provide.
- Separate action names for different agents will be prefixed by agent identifiers as you requested (e.g., loader_L1-load, hoist_H1-lift, driver_D1-drive).
- All sequencing or phases will be modeled with explicit predicates or chain objects (e.g., (phase p1), (next p1 p2), and actions will require current phase preconditions to enforce ordering). I will ensure no reordering is possible where the spec mandates an ordered sequence.
- No penalty/shortfall/token workaround constructs — every preference will be enforced as an impossible-to-violate constraint.
- No placeholders; the domain and problem will be fully expanded.

If you prefer, you can paste the three items (loader_spec, driver_spec, audit_report) directly and I will convert them into PDDL. If you want, you may also supply a small example (2 trucks, 1 hoist, 2 surfaces) and I will generate the concrete PDDL plan encoding for that example.

Once you provide the loader_spec, driver_spec, and audit_report content, I will produce the complete domain and problem in the requested format.

Each step below lists: step #, time interval, agent action (parameters), short precondition note, and concrete effects (state changes).

1) t=0 → 1 — loader-lift(hoist0, crate1, crate0, depot0)
- Precondition satisfied: hoist0 at depot0 and available; crate1 is on crate0 at depot0 and crate1 is clear.
- Effects: hoist0 begins lifting crate1 (hoist0 no longer available, hoist-lifting hoist0 crate1); crate1 removed from surface crate0 and no longer recorded at depot0; crate0 becomes clear.

2) t=1 → 2 — loader-lift(hoist2, crate2, pallet2, depot2)
- Precondition satisfied: hoist2 at depot2 and available; crate2 is on pallet2 at depot2 and crate2 is clear.
- Effects: hoist2 begins lifting crate2 (hoist2 no longer available, hoist-lifting hoist2 crate2); crate2 removed from pallet2 and no longer recorded at depot2; pallet2 becomes clear.

3) t=2 → 3 — loader-load(hoist0, crate1, truck0, depot0)
- Precondition satisfied: hoist0 is lifting crate1 at depot0; truck0 is at depot0.
- Effects: crate1 placed in truck0 (in-truck crate1 truck0); hoist0 stops lifting and becomes available.

4) t=3 → 4 — loader-lift(hoist0, crate0, pallet0, depot0)
- Precondition satisfied: hoist0 at depot0 and available; crate0 is on pallet0 at depot0 and crate0 is clear (was cleared in step 1).
- Effects: hoist0 begins lifting crate0 (hoist0 no longer available, hoist-lifting hoist0 crate0); crate0 removed from pallet0 and no longer recorded at depot0; pallet0 becomes clear.

5) t=4 → 5 — loader-load(hoist0, crate0, truck0, depot0)
- Precondition satisfied: hoist0 lifting crate0 at depot0; truck0 at depot0.
- Effects: crate0 placed in truck0 (in-truck crate0 truck0); hoist0 stops lifting and becomes available; crate0 no longer recorded at depot0.

6) t=5 → 6 — loader-unload(hoist0, crate1, truck0, depot0)
- Precondition satisfied: hoist0 at depot0 and available; truck0 at depot0; crate1 is in truck0.
- Effects: crate1 removed from truck0 (not in-truck); hoist0 begins lifting crate1 (hoist0 no longer available, hoist-lifting hoist0 crate1); crate1 no longer in truck0.

7) t=6 → 7 — loader-drop(hoist0, crate1, pallet0, depot0)
- Precondition satisfied: hoist0 is lifting crate1 at depot0; pallet0 at depot0 and pallet0 is clear.
- Effects: crate1 placed on pallet0 (on crate1 pallet0; surface-at crate1 depot0); pallet0 becomes not clear; crate1 becomes clear; hoist0 stops lifting and becomes available.
- Note: This achieves goal (crate1 on pallet0).

8) t=7 → 8 — driver-drive(truck0, depot0, distributor0)
- Precondition satisfied: truck0 at depot0.
- Effects: truck0 location updated to distributor0 (truck-at truck0 distributor0).

9) t=8 → 9 — loader-unload(hoist3, crate0, truck0, distributor0)
- Precondition satisfied: hoist3 at distributor0 and available; truck0 at distributor0; crate0 is in truck0.
- Effects: crate0 removed from truck0; hoist3 begins lifting crate0 (hoist3 no longer available, hoist-lifting hoist3 crate0); crate0 no longer in truck0.

10) t=9 → 10 — loader-drop(hoist3, crate0, pallet3, distributor0)
- Precondition satisfied: hoist3 is lifting crate0 at distributor0; pallet3 at distributor0 and pallet3 is clear.
- Effects: crate0 placed on pallet3 (on crate0 pallet3; surface-at crate0 distributor0); pallet3 becomes not clear; crate0 becomes clear; hoist3 stops lifting and becomes available.
- Note: This achieves goal (crate0 on pallet3).

11) t=10 → 11 — driver-drive(truck0, distributor0, depot2)
- Precondition satisfied: truck0 at distributor0.
- Effects: truck0 location updated to depot2 (truck-at truck0 depot2).

12) t=11 → 12 — loader-load(hoist2, crate2, truck0, depot2)
- Precondition satisfied: hoist2 is lifting crate2 at depot2 (from step 2); truck0 at depot2.
- Effects: crate2 placed in truck0 (in-truck crate2 truck0); hoist2 stops lifting and becomes available.

13) t=12 → 13 — driver-drive(truck0, depot2, distributor0)
- Precondition satisfied: truck0 at depot2.
- Effects: truck0 location updated to distributor0 (truck-at truck0 distributor0).

14) t=13 → 14 — loader-unload(hoist3, crate2, truck0, distributor0)
- Precondition satisfied: hoist3 at distributor0 and available; truck0 at distributor0; crate2 is in truck0.
- Effects: crate2 removed from truck0; hoist3 begins lifting crate2 (hoist3 no longer available, hoist-lifting hoist3 crate2); crate2 no longer in truck0.

15) t=14 → 15 — loader-drop(hoist3, crate2, crate0, distributor0)
- Precondition satisfied: hoist3 is lifting crate2 at distributor0; crate0 is at distributor0 and is a clear surface (crate0 was placed on pallet3 and left clear).
- Effects: crate2 placed on crate0 (on crate2 crate0; surface-at crate2 distributor0); crate0 becomes not clear (occupied under crate2); crate2 becomes clear; hoist3 stops lifting and becomes available.
- Note: This achieves goal (crate2 on crate0). Combined with step 7 and step 10, all three goal conditions are satisfied:
  - crate0 on pallet3 (step 10)
  - crate1 on pallet0 (step 7)
  - crate2 on crate0 (step 15)

Plan complete at t=15. Total cost (action count) = 15.

PROBLEM
------------------------------
I have to plan the logistics of transporting crates between a number of depots and distributors via trucks that are loaded by hoists. Depots and distributors are directly connected by roads (trucks can drive between any two depots or distributors).

A depot is a type of place.
A distributor is a type of place.
A pallet is a type of surface.
A crate is a type of surface.

Here are the actions that can be performed:

Drive a truck from one place to another place.
Use a hoist to lift a crate from a surface at a place.
Use a hoist to drop a crate to a surface at a place.
Use a hoist to load a crate into a truck at a place.
Use a hoist to unload a crate from a truck at a place.

The following are the restrictions on the actions:
A truck can be driven from one place to another place only if the truck is at the origin place.
Once a truck has been driven from one place to another, it is not at the origin place and is at the destination place.
A crate can be lifted by a hoist only if the hoist is at the same place as the crate, the hoist is available, and the crate is clear.
Once a crate has been lifted by a hoist from a surface at a place, the crate is not at the place, the hoist is lifting the crate, the hoist is not available, the surface is clear, and the crate is not on the surface.
A crate can be dropped by a hoist to a surface only if the hoist and surface are both at the place, the surface is clear, and the hoist is lifting the crate.
Once a crate has been dropped by a hoist to a surface at a place, the hoist is available, the hoist is not lifting the crate, the crate is at the place, the surface is not clear, the crate is clear, and the crate is on the surface.
A crate can be loaded by a hoist onto a truck at a place only if the hoist is at the same place, the truck is at the same place, and the hoist is lifting the crate.
Once a crate has been loaded by a hoist onto a truck at a place, 
A crate can be unloaded by a hoist from a truck at a place only if the hoist is at the same place as the truck, the hoist is available, and the crate is in the truck.
Once a crate has been unloaded by a hoist from a truck at a place, the crate is not in the truck, the hoist is not available, and the hoist is lifting the crate.

[STATEMENT]
As initial conditions I have that, crate0 is at depot2, crate1 is at depot0, crate2 is at depot2, hoist0 is at depot0, hoist1 is at depot1, hoist2 is at depot2, hoist3 is at distributor0, pallet0 is at depot0, pallet1 is at depot1, pallet2 is at depot2, pallet3 is at distributor0, truck0 is at depot2, truck1 is at depot0, truck2 is at depot2, hoist0 is available, hoist1 is available, hoist2 is available, hoist3 is available, crate1 is clear, crate2 is clear, pallet1 is clear, pallet3 is clear, crate0 is on pallet2, crate1 is on pallet0 and crate2 is on crate0.
My goal is to have that crate1 is on pallet0 and crate2 is on pallet3.

My plan is as follows:

NATURAL-PLAN sas_plan_5
------------------------------
Summary: three sequential hoist actions are executed by hoist2 to move crate2 from atop crate0 at depot2 to pallet3 at distributor0. Each action consumes the next stage token (s0→s1→s2→s3). Assume each action takes one time unit (timestamps shown). Total cost = 3 (unit cost per action). Crate1 was already on pallet0 in the initial state, so the final goals are achieved.

Step 1 — Time 0.0 → 1.0 (stage s0 → s1)
Action: hoist_lift_from_crate hoist2 lifts crate2 from crate0 at depot2
- Parameters: hoist = hoist2, crate = crate2, below = crate0, location = depot2
- Preconditions (satisfied in initial state):
  - hoist2 is at depot2
  - crate2 is on crate0
  - crate0 is at depot2
  - crate2 is clear
  - hoist2 is free
  - stage-ready s0 and succ s0 s1
- Effects:
  - crate2 is no longer on crate0
  - crate2 is no longer considered at depot2 (it is held)
  - hoist2 becomes attached to (holding) crate2
  - hoist2 becomes not free
  - crate0 becomes clear
  - stage-ready token advances (s0 consumed, s1 becomes ready)

State note after Step 1: hoist2 is holding crate2 at depot2 (hoist-attached hoist2 crate2); crate0 is clear; hoist2 not free.

Step 2 — Time 1.0 → 2.0 (stage s1 → s2)
Action: hoist_move hoist2 moves from depot2 to distributor0
- Parameters: hoist = hoist2, from = depot2, to = distributor0
- Preconditions:
  - hoist2 is at depot2 (true after step 1)
  - stage-ready s1 and succ s1 s2
- Effects:
  - hoist2 is no longer at depot2
  - hoist2 is now at distributor0
  - stage-ready token advances (s1 consumed, s2 becomes ready)

State note after Step 2: hoist2 (still holding crate2) is located at distributor0.

Step 3 — Time 2.0 → 3.0 (stage s2 → s3)
Action: hoist_drop_to_pallet hoist2 drops crate2 onto pallet3 at distributor0
- Parameters: hoist = hoist2, crate = crate2, pallet = pallet3, location = distributor0
- Preconditions:
  - hoist2 is attached to (holding) crate2
  - hoist2 is at distributor0
  - pallet3 is at distributor0
  - pallet3 is clear
  - stage-ready s2 and succ s2 s3
- Effects:
  - hoist2 is no longer attached to crate2
  - hoist2 becomes free
  - crate2 is on-pallet pallet3
  - crate2 is at distributor0
  - pallet3 becomes not clear
  - crate2 becomes clear
  - stage-ready token advances (s2 consumed, s3 becomes ready)

Final state (after Time 3.0):
- on-pallet crate1 pallet0 (from initial state) — goal 1 satisfied
- on-pallet crate2 pallet3 — achieved by Step 3 — goal 2 satisfied

PROBLEM
------------------------------
I have to plan the logistics of transporting crates between a number of depots and distributors via trucks that are loaded by hoists. Depots and distributors are directly connected by roads (trucks can drive between any two depots or distributors).

A depot is a type of place.
A distributor is a type of place.
A pallet is a type of surface.
A crate is a type of surface.

Here are the actions that can be performed:

Drive a truck from one place to another place.
Use a hoist to lift a crate from a surface at a place.
Use a hoist to drop a crate to a surface at a place.
Use a hoist to load a crate into a truck at a place.
Use a hoist to unload a crate from a truck at a place.

The following are the restrictions on the actions:
A truck can be driven from one place to another place only if the truck is at the origin place.
Once a truck has been driven from one place to another, it is not at the origin place and is at the destination place.
A crate can be lifted by a hoist only if the hoist is at the same place as the crate, the hoist is available, and the crate is clear.
Once a crate has been lifted by a hoist from a surface at a place, the crate is not at the place, the hoist is lifting the crate, the hoist is not available, the surface is clear, and the crate is not on the surface.
A crate can be dropped by a hoist to a surface only if the hoist and surface are both at the place, the surface is clear, and the hoist is lifting the crate.
Once a crate has been dropped by a hoist to a surface at a place, the hoist is available, the hoist is not lifting the crate, the crate is at the place, the surface is not clear, the crate is clear, and the crate is on the surface.
A crate can be loaded by a hoist onto a truck at a place only if the hoist is at the same place, the truck is at the same place, and the hoist is lifting the crate.
Once a crate has been loaded by a hoist onto a truck at a place, 
A crate can be unloaded by a hoist from a truck at a place only if the hoist is at the same place as the truck, the hoist is available, and the crate is in the truck.
Once a crate has been unloaded by a hoist from a truck at a place, the crate is not in the truck, the hoist is not available, and the hoist is lifting the crate.

[STATEMENT]
As initial conditions I have that, crate0 is at depot2, crate1 is at distributor0, crate2 is at depot1, hoist0 is at depot0, hoist1 is at depot1, hoist2 is at depot2, hoist3 is at distributor0, pallet0 is at depot0, pallet1 is at depot1, pallet2 is at depot2, pallet3 is at distributor0, truck0 is at depot1, truck1 is at depot1, truck2 is at depot1, hoist0 is available, hoist1 is available, hoist2 is available, hoist3 is available, crate0 is clear, crate1 is clear, crate2 is clear, pallet0 is clear, crate0 is on pallet2, crate1 is on pallet3 and crate2 is on pallet1.
My goal is to have that crate0 is on pallet0, crate1 is on pallet1 and crate2 is on pallet3.

My plan is as follows:
