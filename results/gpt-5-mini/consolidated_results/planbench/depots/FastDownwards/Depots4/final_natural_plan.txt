1) Time s0 → s1 (duration: 1 unit) — hoist-lift(hoist1, crate2, pallet1) at depot1
   - Action: Hoist hoist1 lifts crate2 from pallet1 at depot1.
   - Preconditions satisfied: hoist1 is at depot1 and free; crate2 is at depot1 on pallet1 and is clear; pallet1 is at depot1.
   - Effects: hoist1 is now holding crate2 (hoist1 no longer free); crate2 is removed from pallet1 and no longer at the place; pallet1 becomes clear.

2) Time s1 → s2 (duration: 1 unit) — move-hoist(hoist1, depot1 → depot0)
   - Action: Hoist hoist1 moves from depot1 to depot0 while still holding crate2.
   - Preconditions satisfied: hoist1 is at depot1 and road(depot1,depot0) holds.
   - Effects: hoist1 is at depot0 (still holding crate2).

3) Time s2 → s3 (duration: 1 unit) — hoist-lift(hoist0, crate1, crate0) at depot0
   - Action: Hoist hoist0 lifts crate1 from the top of crate0 at depot0.
   - Preconditions satisfied: hoist0 is at depot0 and free; crate1 is at depot0 on crate0 and crate1 is clear; crate0 is at depot0 as a surface.
   - Effects: hoist0 is now holding crate1 (hoist0 no longer free); crate1 is removed from crate0; crate0 becomes clear (available as a target).

4) Time s3 → s4 (duration: 1 unit) — move-hoist(hoist3, distributor0 → depot0)
   - Action: Hoist hoist3 moves from distributor0 to depot0 (hoist3 is free).
   - Preconditions satisfied: hoist3 is at distributor0 and road(distributor0,depot0) holds.
   - Effects: hoist3 is at depot0.

5) Time s4 → s5 (duration: 1 unit) — hoist-lift(hoist3, crate0, pallet0) at depot0
   - Action: Hoist hoist3 lifts crate0 from pallet0 at depot0.
   - Preconditions satisfied: hoist3 is at depot0 and free; crate0 is at depot0 on pallet0 and is clear (crate1 was removed in step 3); pallet0 is at depot0.
   - Effects: hoist3 is now holding crate0 (hoist3 no longer free); crate0 is removed from pallet0 and pallet0 becomes clear.

6) Time s5 → s6 (duration: 1 unit) — hoist-drop-onto-surface(hoist1, crate2, pallet0) at depot0
   - Action: Hoist hoist1 drops the crate it is holding (crate2) onto pallet0 at depot0.
   - Preconditions satisfied: hoist1 is at depot0 and holding crate2; pallet0 is at depot0 and is clear (now clear after crate0 was lifted in step 5).
   - Effects: crate2 is placed on pallet0 at depot0 (crate2 becomes at-surface at depot0); hoist1 becomes free; crate2 is now clear.

7) Time s6 → s7 (duration: 1 unit) — move-hoist(hoist3, depot0 → depot1)
   - Action: Hoist hoist3 moves from depot0 to depot1 while holding crate0.
   - Preconditions satisfied: hoist3 is at depot0 and road(depot0,depot1) holds.
   - Effects: hoist3 is at depot1 (still holding crate0).

8) Time s7 → s8 (duration: 1 unit) — move-hoist(hoist0, depot0 → depot1)
   - Action: Hoist hoist0 moves from depot0 to depot1 while holding crate1.
   - Preconditions satisfied: hoist0 is at depot0 and road(depot0,depot1) holds.
   - Effects: hoist0 is at depot1 (still holding crate1).

9) Time s8 → s9 (duration: 1 unit) — hoist-drop-onto-surface(hoist3, crate0, pallet1) at depot1
   - Action: Hoist hoist3 drops crate0 onto pallet1 at depot1.
   - Preconditions satisfied: hoist3 is at depot1 holding crate0; pallet1 is at depot1 and is clear (it was cleared when crate2 was lifted in step 1).
   - Effects: crate0 is placed on pallet1 at depot1 (crate0 becomes at-surface at depot1); hoist3 becomes free; crate0 is now clear.

10) Time s9 → s10 (duration: 1 unit) — hoist-drop-onto-surface(hoist0, crate1, crate0) at depot1
    - Action: Hoist hoist0 drops crate1 onto crate0 at depot1.
    - Preconditions satisfied: hoist0 is at depot1 holding crate1; crate0 is at depot1 as a supporting surface (placed on pallet1) and is clear (after being dropped in step 9).
    - Effects: crate1 is placed on crate0 at depot1; hoist0 becomes free; crate1 is now clear.

Final state confirmation:
- crate0 is on pallet1 (at depot1),
- crate1 is on crate0 (at depot1),
- crate2 is on pallet0 (at depot0).

The sequence above exactly follows the provided plan (s0→s10), respects hoist availability and co-location preconditions, and achieves the specified goal.
