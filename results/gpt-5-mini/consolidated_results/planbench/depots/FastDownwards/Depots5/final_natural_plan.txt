Summary: each action takes 1 time unit. Start time = 0. Stages correspond to the plan stages st0…st11. The following lists the 11 actions in the exact order from the plan, with timestamps (time intervals), the agent/actor, the action parameters, a short note of the key precondition that makes the action valid at that time, and the principal effects.

1) Time 0 -> 1  (stage st0 -> st1)
   Action: truck-drive truck2 depot1 distributor0
   Actor: truck_driver (controls truck2)
   Key precondition: truck2 is at depot1 and a road connects depot1 to distributor0.
   Effects: truck2 is now at distributor0 and no longer at depot1.

2) Time 1 -> 2  (stage st1 -> st2)
   Action: hoist-lift hoist3 crate2 crate1 distributor0
   Actor: hoist_operator (hoist3)
   Key precondition: hoist3 is at distributor0, crate2 is on surface crate1 at distributor0, crate2 is clear, and hoist3 is available.
   Effects: hoist3 picks up crate2 (hoist3 holds crate2), hoist3 becomes not available, crate2 is removed from surface crate1, and crate1 (the supporting surface) becomes clear.

3) Time 2 -> 3  (stage st2 -> st3)
   Action: hoist-load hoist3 crate2 truck2 distributor0
   Actor: hoist_operator (hoist3) working with truck2
   Key precondition: hoist3 and truck2 are co-located at distributor0 and hoist3 is holding crate2.
   Effects: crate2 is loaded inside truck2, hoist3 becomes available and stops holding crate2.

4) Time 3 -> 4  (stage st3 -> st4)
   Action: hoist-lift hoist3 crate1 crate0 distributor0
   Actor: hoist_operator (hoist3)
   Key precondition: hoist3 is at distributor0 and available; crate1 is on surface crate0 at distributor0 and crate1 is clear.
   Effects: hoist3 picks up crate1 (holds crate1), hoist3 becomes not available, crate1 is removed from crate0, and crate0 becomes clear.

5) Time 4 -> 5  (stage st4 -> st5)
   Action: hoist-load hoist3 crate1 truck2 distributor0
   Actor: hoist_operator (hoist3) with truck2
   Key precondition: hoist3 and truck2 are co-located at distributor0 and hoist3 is holding crate1.
   Effects: crate1 is placed inside truck2, hoist3 becomes available and stops holding crate1.

6) Time 5 -> 6  (stage st5 -> st6)
   Action: truck-drive truck2 distributor0 depot1
   Actor: truck_driver (truck2)
   Key precondition: truck2 is at distributor0 and a road connects distributor0 to depot1.
   Effects: truck2 moves to depot1 and is no longer at distributor0.

7) Time 6 -> 7  (stage st6 -> st7)
   Action: hoist-unload hoist1 truck2 crate1 depot1
   Actor: hoist_operator (hoist1) unloading from truck2
   Key precondition: hoist1 is at depot1 and available, truck2 is at depot1, and crate1 is inside truck2.
   Effects: crate1 is removed from truck2 and hoist1 begins holding crate1 (hoist1 becomes not available).

8) Time 7 -> 8  (stage st7 -> st8)
   Action: truck-drive truck2 depot1 depot2
   Actor: truck_driver (truck2)
   Key precondition: truck2 is at depot1 and a road connects depot1 to depot2.
   Effects: truck2 moves to depot2 and is no longer at depot1 (crate2 remains inside truck2).

9) Time 8 -> 9  (stage st8 -> st9)
   Action: hoist-unload hoist2 truck2 crate2 depot2
   Actor: hoist_operator (hoist2)
   Key precondition: hoist2 is at depot2 and available, truck2 is at depot2, and crate2 is inside truck2.
   Effects: crate2 is removed from truck2 and hoist2 begins holding crate2 (hoist2 becomes not available).

10) Time 9 -> 10  (stage st9 -> st10)
    Action: hoist-drop hoist1 crate1 pallet1 depot1
    Actor: hoist_operator (hoist1)
    Key precondition: hoist1 is at depot1 and is holding crate1, and pallet1 is at depot1 and clear.
    Effects: hoist1 releases crate1 onto pallet1; hoist1 becomes available; crate1 is on pallet1 and crate1 becomes clear; pallet1 becomes not clear.

11) Time 10 -> 11  (stage st10 -> st11)
    Action: hoist-drop hoist2 crate2 pallet2 depot2
    Actor: hoist_operator (hoist2)
    Key precondition: hoist2 is at depot2 and is holding crate2, and pallet2 is at depot2 and clear.
    Effects: hoist2 releases crate2 onto pallet2; hoist2 becomes available; crate2 is on pallet2 and crate2 becomes clear; pallet2 becomes not clear.

Final state after Time 11:
- crate1 is on pallet1 (goal satisfied)
- crate2 is on pallet2 (goal satisfied)

Cost: 11 actions, unit cost per action (total cost = 11), matching the provided plan.
