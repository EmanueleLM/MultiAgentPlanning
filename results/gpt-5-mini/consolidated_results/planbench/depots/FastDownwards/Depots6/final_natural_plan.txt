Summary
- The following is a human-readable, step-by-step rendering of the provided plan (exact actions and parameters preserved).
- Each step lists: the plan action (as given), the acting agent (player_A), required preconditions (from the public action specs), whether those preconditions are satisfied at that time (and where they come from), the action effects (add / delete), and the key resulting facts relevant to the goals.
- I assign a simple timeline: each step starts at integer time t = 0, 1, 2, ... and has duration 1.0 time unit.

Initial relevant facts (from the combined problem init; only facts referenced below are shown):
- hand object_9, hand object_10
- sneeze object_3, sneeze object_4, sneeze object_5
- cats object_0, cats object_1
- texture object_5, texture object_6, texture object_7, texture object_8, texture object_9
- spring object_5, spring object_6, spring object_7, spring object_8
- stupendous object_1, stupendous object_2, stupendous object_3
- collect object_5 object_1, collect object_6 object_1, collect object_6 object_2, collect object_7 object_2, collect object_8 object_2, collect object_8 object_3, collect object_9 object_3
- next object_0 object_5, next object_3 object_5, next object_4 object_8, next object_9 object_6, next object_0 object_8, next object_1 object_6, next object_10 object_9, next object_4 object_6, next object_5 object_9
- No (vase ...) facts initially.

Plan steps

Step 1 — t = 0.0 (duration 1.0)
Action (as in plan): (playera-clip object_9 object_4 object_6)
Natural-language: player_A performs clip with x=object_9, y=object_4, z=object_6.

Preconditions (clip, public spec):
- hand ?x  => hand object_9
- sneeze ?y => sneeze object_4
- texture ?z => texture object_6
- next ?y ?z => next object_4 object_6
- next ?x ?z => next object_9 object_6

Are preconditions satisfied now?
- hand object_9: true (Scenario 1 init)
- sneeze object_4: true (Scenario 1 init)
- texture object_6: true (Scenario 1 / 2 init)
- next object_4 object_6: true (Scenario 2 init)
- next object_9 object_6: true (Scenario 1 init)
=> All preconditions satisfied.

Effects (clip):
- Add: (vase object_9 object_4)
- Delete: (next object_9 object_6)

Resulting key changes:
- next object_9 object_6 is removed.
- vase object_9 object_4 is created.

Step 2 — t = 1.0 (duration 1.0)
Action: (playera-wretched object_4 object_8 object_9 object_3)
Natural-language: player_A performs wretched with x=object_4, y=object_8, z=object_9, w=object_3.

Preconditions (wretched):
- sneeze ?x => sneeze object_4
- texture ?y => texture object_8
- texture ?z => texture object_9
- stupendous ?w => stupendous object_3
- next ?x ?y => next object_4 object_8
- collect ?y ?w => collect object_8 object_3
- collect ?z ?w => collect object_9 object_3

Are preconditions satisfied now?
- sneeze object_4: true
- texture object_8: true
- texture object_9: true (Scenario 2)
- stupendous object_3: true (Scenario 2)
- next object_4 object_8: true (Scenario 1 init)
- collect object_8 object_3: true (Scenario 2)
- collect object_9 object_3: true (Scenario 2)
=> All preconditions satisfied.

Effects (wretched):
- Add: (next object_4 object_9)
- Delete: (next object_4 object_8)

Resulting key changes:
- next object_4 object_8 is removed.
- next object_4 object_9 is added.

Step 3 — t = 2.0 (duration 1.0)
Action: (playera-clip object_10 object_4 object_9)
Natural-language: player_A performs clip with x=object_10, y=object_4, z=object_9.

Preconditions (clip):
- hand object_10
- sneeze object_4
- texture object_9
- next object_4 object_9
- next object_10 object_9

Are preconditions satisfied now?
- hand object_10: true (Scenario 2 init)
- sneeze object_4: true
- texture object_9: true
- next object_4 object_9: true (added in Step 2)
- next object_10 object_9: true (Scenario 2 init)
=> All preconditions satisfied.

Effects (clip):
- Add: (vase object_10 object_4)
- Delete: (next object_10 object_9)

Resulting key changes:
- next object_10 object_9 is removed.
- vase object_10 object_4 is created.

Step 4 — t = 3.0 (duration 1.0)
Action: (playera-tightfisted object_10 object_4 object_6)
Natural-language: player_A performs tightfisted with x=object_10, y=object_4, z=object_6.

Preconditions (tightfisted):
- hand ?x => hand object_10
- sneeze ?y => sneeze object_4
- texture ?z => texture object_6
- next ?y ?z => next object_4 object_6
- vase ?x ?y => vase object_10 object_4

Are preconditions satisfied now?
- hand object_10: true
- sneeze object_4: true
- texture object_6: true
- next object_4 object_6: true (Scenario 2 init; still present at this time)
- vase object_10 object_4: true (created in Step 3)
=> All preconditions satisfied.

Effects (tightfisted):
- Add: (next object_10 object_6)
- Delete: (vase object_10 object_4)

Resulting key changes:
- vase object_10 object_4 is removed.
- next object_10 object_6 is added — this achieves the Scenario 2 goal (next object_10 object_6).

Step 5 — t = 4.0 (duration 1.0)
Action: (playera-wretched object_4 object_6 object_7 object_2)
Natural-language: player_A performs wretched with x=object_4, y=object_6, z=object_7, w=object_2.

Preconditions (wretched):
- sneeze ?x => sneeze object_4
- texture ?y => texture object_6
- texture ?z => texture object_7
- stupendous ?w => stupendous object_2
- next ?x ?y => next object_4 object_6
- collect ?y ?w => collect object_6 object_2
- collect ?z ?w => collect object_7 object_2

Are preconditions satisfied now?
- sneeze object_4: true
- texture object_6: true
- texture object_7: true
- stupendous object_2: true
- next object_4 object_6: true (present from init; was not deleted previously)
- collect object_6 object_2: true (Scenario 2 init)
- collect object_7 object_2: true (Scenario 1 and 2 init)
=> All preconditions satisfied.

Effects (wretched):
- Add: (next object_4 object_7)
- Delete: (next object_4 object_6)

Resulting key changes:
- next object_4 object_6 is removed.
- next object_4 object_7 is added.

Step 6 — t = 5.0 (duration 1.0)
Action: (playera-tightfisted object_9 object_4 object_7)
Natural-language: player_A performs tightfisted with x=object_9, y=object_4, z=object_7.

Preconditions (tightfisted):
- hand ?x => hand object_9
- sneeze ?y => sneeze object_4
- texture ?z => texture object_7
- next ?y ?z => next object_4 object_7
- vase ?x ?y => vase object_9 object_4

Are preconditions satisfied now?
- hand object_9: true
- sneeze object_4: true
- texture object_7: true
- next object_4 object_7: true (added in Step 5)
- vase object_9 object_4: true (created in Step 1 and not yet deleted)
=> All preconditions satisfied.

Effects (tightfisted):
- Add: (next object_9 object_7)
- Delete: (vase object_9 object_4)

Resulting key changes:
- vase object_9 object_4 is removed.
- next object_9 object_7 is added — this achieves the Scenario 1 goal (next object_9 object_7).

Final status (after Step 6)
- Both goals are achieved:
  - (next object_9 object_7) — achieved at the end of Step 6.
  - (next object_10 object_6) — achieved at the end of Step 4.
- All six plan actions (exactly as provided) were applied in order; every action's preconditions were verifiably satisfied at the time it was applied using only the problem initial facts plus effects of prior plan steps (no external assumptions needed).

Notes and trace highlights
- Vase facts are produced and consumed within the plan (created by clip, consumed by tightfisted), as intended.
- Several (next ...) facts are updated by wretched and tightfisted actions to route links toward the goal nodes.
- Timeline used here is a simple discrete schedule (each action 1.0 unit). If you need actual wall-clock timestamps or parallel execution analysis, indicate desired timing/parallelism rules and I can produce an adjusted schedule.

If you want the same information as a compact table or as a machine-readable step list (JSON), say which format you prefer.
