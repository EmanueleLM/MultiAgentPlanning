Below is a human-readable, step-by-step trace of the provided plan. Each step corresponds exactly to one action in the PDDL plan. Every action advances the global stage by one (duration = 1 stage); I report the stage transition (timestamp) for each step and the brief effect/result when helpful.

Step 1 — (drive truck0 distributor0 → depot0) [s0 → s1]
  - Drive truck0 from distributor0 to depot0. (truck0: distributor0 → depot0)

Step 2 — (hoist-pick-from-crate hoist0 picks crate2 from crate1 at depot0) [s1 → s2]
  - Hoist0 picks up crate2 from the top of crate1 at depot0. (crate2 removed from on-crate crate1; hoist0 is now lifting crate2)

Step 3 — (hoist-pick-from-pallet hoist2 picks crate0 from pallet2 at depot2) [s2 → s3]
  - Hoist2 picks up crate0 from pallet2 at depot2. (crate0 removed from pallet2; hoist2 is now lifting crate0)

Step 4 — (move-hoist hoist3 distributor0 → depot0) [s3 → s4]
  - Move hoist3 from distributor0 to depot0. (hoist3: distributor0 → depot0)

Step 5 — (hoist-pick-from-pallet hoist3 picks crate1 from pallet0 at depot0) [s4 → s5]
  - Hoist3 picks up crate1 from pallet0 at depot0. (crate1 removed from pallet0; hoist3 is now lifting crate1)

Step 6 — (hoist-load-into-truck hoist0 loads crate2 into truck0 at depot0) [s5 → s6]
  - Hoist0 loads the hoisted crate2 into truck0 at depot0. (crate2 is now in truck0; hoist0 becomes available)

Step 7 — (hoist-place-on-pallet hoist3 places crate1 on pallet0 at depot0) [s6 → s7]
  - Hoist3 places crate1 back onto pallet0 at depot0. (crate1 is on pallet0 again; hoist3 becomes available)

Step 8 — (drive truck0 depot0 → depot1) [s7 → s8]
  - Drive truck0 from depot0 to depot1. (truck0: depot0 → depot1)

Step 9 — (hoist-unload-from-truck hoist1 unloads crate2 from truck0 at depot1) [s8 → s9]
  - Hoist1 (available at depot1) unloads crate2 from truck0. (crate2 removed from truck0 and is now held by hoist1)

Step 10 — (hoist-pick-from-pallet hoist0 picks crate1 from pallet0 at depot0) [s9 → s10]
  - Hoist0 (available at depot0) picks up crate1 from pallet0 at depot0. (crate1 removed from pallet0; hoist0 is now lifting crate1)

Step 11 — (hoist-place-on-pallet hoist1 places crate2 on pallet1 at depot1) [s10 → s11]
  - Hoist1 places crate2 onto pallet1 at depot1. (crate2 is now on pallet1; hoist1 becomes available)

Step 12 — (hoist-load-into-truck hoist2 loads crate0 into truck2 at depot2) [s11 → s12]
  - Hoist2 loads the hoisted crate0 into truck2 at depot2. (crate0 is now in truck2; hoist2 becomes available)

Step 13 — (move-hoist hoist2 depot2 → depot1) [s12 → s13]
  - Move hoist2 from depot2 to depot1. (hoist2: depot2 → depot1)

Step 14 — (drive truck2 depot2 → depot1) [s13 → s14]
  - Drive truck2 from depot2 to depot1. (truck2: depot2 → depot1)

Step 15 — (hoist-unload-from-truck hoist2 unloads crate0 from truck2 at depot1) [s14 → s15]
  - Hoist2 (at depot1) unloads crate0 from truck2. (crate0 removed from truck2 and is now held by hoist2)

Step 16 — (hoist-place-on-crate hoist2 places crate0 on crate2 at depot1) [s15 → s16]
  - Hoist2 places crate0 onto crate2 at depot1. (crate0 is now on crate2 — making crate0 on-crate crate2)

Step 17 — (drive truck0 depot1 → depot0) [s16 → s17]
  - Drive truck0 from depot1 back to depot0. (truck0: depot1 → depot0)

Step 18 — (hoist-place-on-pallet hoist0 places crate1 on pallet0 at depot0) [s17 → s18]
  - Hoist0 places crate1 back onto pallet0 at depot0. (crate1 is on pallet0; hoist0 becomes available)

Step 19 — (move-hoist hoist0 depot0 → depot2) [s18 → s19]
  - Move hoist0 from depot0 to depot2. (hoist0: depot0 → depot2)

Step 20 — (hoist-pick-from-pallet hoist3 picks crate1 from pallet0 at depot0) [s19 → s20]
  - Hoist3 (available at depot0) picks up crate1 from pallet0 at depot0. (crate1 removed from pallet0; hoist3 is now lifting crate1)

Step 21 — (hoist-load-into-truck hoist3 loads crate1 into truck0 at depot0) [s20 → s21]
  - Hoist3 loads the hoisted crate1 into truck0 at depot0. (crate1 is now in truck0; hoist3 becomes available)

Step 22 — (move-hoist hoist3 depot0 → depot2) [s21 → s22]
  - Move hoist3 from depot0 to depot2. (hoist3: depot0 → depot2)

Step 23 — (drive truck0 depot0 → depot2) [s22 → s23]
  - Drive truck0 from depot0 to depot2. (truck0: depot0 → depot2)

Step 24 — (hoist-unload-from-truck hoist3 unloads crate1 from truck0 at depot2) [s23 → s24]
  - Hoist3 (at depot2) unloads crate1 from truck0. (crate1 removed from truck0 and is now held by hoist3)

Step 25 — (hoist-place-on-pallet hoist3 places crate1 on pallet2 at depot2) [s24 → s25]
  - Hoist3 places crate1 onto pallet2 at depot2. (crate1 is on pallet2; hoist3 becomes available)

Final state (as required by the goal):
  - crate0 is on crate2 (achieved at Step 16).
  - crate1 is on pallet2 (achieved at Step 25).
  - crate2 is on pallet1 (achieved at Step 11).

Plan cost / duration summary:
  - Each action advances one stage; the plan contains 25 actions → total of 25 stage-steps.
  - Reported plan cost: 25 (unit cost).

This trace follows the provided PDDL plan exactly, reporting each action, its place-to-place movement or manipulation, and the stage timestamps s0 → s25.
