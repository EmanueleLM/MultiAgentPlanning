1. time0 → time1: hoist1 lifts crate0 from pallet1 at depot1.
   - Result: crate0 is removed from pallet1 and hoist1 is now lifting crate0 (hoist1 becomes unavailable); pallet1 becomes clear.

2. time1 → time2: hoist1 loads crate0 into truck2 at depot1.
   - Result: crate0 is placed in truck2 (in-truck crate0 truck2); hoist1 stops lifting and becomes available.

3. time2 → time3: hoist3 lifts crate1 from pallet3 at distributor0.
   - Result: crate1 is removed from pallet3 and hoist3 is now lifting crate1 (hoist3 becomes unavailable); pallet3 becomes clear.

4. time3 → time4: hoist3 loads crate1 into truck1 at distributor0.
   - Result: crate1 is placed in truck1 (in-truck crate1 truck1); hoist3 stops lifting and becomes available.

5. time4 → time5: hoist0 lifts crate2 from pallet0 at depot0.
   - Result: crate2 is removed from pallet0 and hoist0 is now lifting crate2 (hoist0 becomes unavailable); pallet0 becomes clear.

6. time5 → time6: hoist0 loads crate2 into truck0 at depot0.
   - Result: crate2 is placed in truck0 (in-truck crate2 truck0); hoist0 stops lifting and becomes available.

7. time6 → time7: truck0 drives from depot0 to depot1.
   - Result: truck0 location updates to depot1.

8. time7 → time8: hoist1 unloads crate2 from truck0 at depot1.
   - Result: crate2 is removed from truck0 and hoist1 begins lifting crate2 (hoist1 becomes unavailable).

9. time8 → time9: hoist1 drops crate2 onto pallet1 at depot1.
   - Result: crate2 is placed on pallet1 (on-pallet crate2 pallet1); hoist1 stops lifting and becomes available; pallet1 becomes not clear.

10. time9 → time10: truck1 drives from distributor0 to depot1.
    - Result: truck1 location updates to depot1.

11. time10 → time11: hoist1 unloads crate1 from truck1 at depot1.
    - Result: crate1 is removed from truck1 and hoist1 begins lifting crate1 (hoist1 becomes unavailable).

12. time11 → time12: truck2 drives from depot1 to distributor0.
    - Result: truck2 location updates to distributor0.

13. time12 → time13: hoist3 unloads crate0 from truck2 at distributor0.
    - Result: crate0 is removed from truck2 and hoist3 begins lifting crate0 (hoist3 becomes unavailable).

14. time13 → time14: hoist3 drops crate0 onto pallet3 at distributor0.
    - Result: crate0 is placed on pallet3 (on-pallet crate0 pallet3); hoist3 stops lifting and becomes available; pallet3 becomes not clear.

15. time14 → time15: hoist1 drops crate1 onto crate2 at depot1.
    - Result: crate1 is placed on crate2 (on-crate crate1 crate2); hoist1 stops lifting and becomes available; crate2 becomes not clear.

Final state (by time15): crate0 is on pallet3, crate2 is on pallet1, and crate1 is on crate2 — the goal is achieved.
