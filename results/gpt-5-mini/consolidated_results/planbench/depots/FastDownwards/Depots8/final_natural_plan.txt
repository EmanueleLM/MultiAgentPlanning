Plan timeline (each action takes 1 time unit). Initial time t=0. Total cost = 6.

1) t=0 → t=1 (duration 1)
   Action: Hoist hoist1 lifts crate2 from crate0 at depot1.
   - Agent: hoist1
   - Preconditions satisfied: hoist1 is at depot1 and free; crate2 is on crate0 at depot1; crate2 is clear (top).
   - Effects: hoist1 begins lifting crate2 (hoist1 no longer free); crate2 is removed from crate0 and is no longer considered at the place; crate0 becomes clear (it is now free of the top crate).

2) t=1 → t=2 (duration 1)
   Action: Hoist hoist0 moves from depot0 to depot1.
   - Agent: hoist0
   - Preconditions satisfied: hoist0 is at depot0.
   - Effects: hoist0 is now at depot1 (and no longer at depot0).

3) t=2 → t=3 (duration 1)
   Action: Hoist hoist0 lifts crate0 from pallet1 at depot1.
   - Agent: hoist0
   - Preconditions satisfied: hoist0 is at depot1 and free; pallet1 is at depot1; crate0 is on pallet1; crate0 is clear (became clear after step 1).
   - Effects: hoist0 begins lifting crate0 (hoist0 no longer free); crate0 is removed from pallet1 and is no longer considered at the place; pallet1 becomes clear.

4) t=3 → t=4 (duration 1)
   Action: Hoist hoist0 moves from depot1 back to depot0.
   - Agent: hoist0
   - Preconditions satisfied: hoist0 is at depot1 (carrying/lifting crate0).
   - Effects: hoist0 (with crate0 lifted) is now at depot0 (and no longer at depot1).

5) t=4 → t=5 (duration 1)
   Action: Hoist hoist0 drops crate0 onto pallet0 at depot0.
   - Agent: hoist0
   - Preconditions satisfied: hoist0 is at depot0 and is lifting crate0; pallet0 is at depot0 and is clear.
   - Effects: crate0 is placed on pallet0 at depot0; hoist0 becomes free and stops lifting crate0; pallet0 becomes not clear; crate0 becomes clear (top).

6) t=5 → t=6 (duration 1)
   Action: Hoist hoist1 drops crate2 onto pallet1 at depot1.
   - Agent: hoist1
   - Preconditions satisfied: hoist1 is at depot1 and is lifting crate2; pallet1 is at depot1 and is clear (became clear in step 3).
   - Effects: crate2 is placed on pallet1 at depot1; hoist1 becomes free and stops lifting crate2; pallet1 becomes not clear; crate2 becomes clear.

Outcome at t=6:
- crate0 is on pallet0 (goal satisfied).
- crate2 is on pallet1 (goal satisfied).
