Summary (initial state highlights)
- Relevant objects: object_0 .. object_11.
- Key initial predicates (only those used by the plan and checks below):
  - hand: object_9, object_10
  - sneeze: object_3, object_4
  - texture: object_5, object_6, object_7, object_8
  - next: (object_0 object_5), (object_10 object_5), (object_3 object_5), (object_4 object_8), (object_9 object_5)
  - collect: (object_5 object_1), (object_6 object_1), (object_7 object_2), (object_8 object_2)
  - stupendous: object_1, object_2
- Goal to achieve: next object_10 object_6 AND next object_9 object_6.

Execution plan (actions from the provided plan; each step 1 time unit; timestamps shown)

Step 0 — initial time (t = 0)
- State as listed in the summary above.

Step 1 — t = 0 → 1
Action: clip object_9 object_3 object_5
- Preconditions checked:
  - hand object_9 — true initially.
  - sneeze object_3 — true initially.
  - texture object_5 — true initially.
  - next object_3 object_5 — true initially.
  - next object_9 object_5 — true initially.
- Effects applied:
  - Add: vase object_9 object_3.
  - Delete: next object_9 object_5.
- Resulting relevant predicates after step:
  - vase(object_9, object_3) is now true.
  - next(object_9, object_5) is now false (removed).
  - next(object_3, object_5) remains true (untouched).

Step 2 — t = 1 → 2
Action: clip object_10 object_3 object_5
- Preconditions checked:
  - hand object_10 — true initially.
  - sneeze object_3 — still true.
  - texture object_5 — true.
  - next object_3 object_5 — true.
  - next object_10 object_5 — true initially and not deleted by step 1.
- Effects applied:
  - Add: vase object_10 object_3.
  - Delete: next object_10 object_5.
- Resulting relevant predicates after step:
  - vase(object_10, object_3) is now true.
  - next(object_10, object_5) is now false.
  - next(object_3, object_5) remains true.

Step 3 — t = 2 → 3
Action: wretched object_3 object_5 object_6 object_1
- Mapping to parameters: ?wa=object_3, ?wb=object_5, ?wc=object_6, ?wd=object_1
- Preconditions checked:
  - sneeze object_3 — true.
  - texture object_5 — true.
  - texture object_6 — true.
  - stupendous object_1 — true.
  - next object_3 object_5 — true (still present).
  - collect object_5 object_1 — true initially.
  - collect object_6 object_1 — true initially.
- Effects applied:
  - Add: next object_3 object_6.
  - Delete: next object_3 object_5.
- Resulting relevant predicates after step:
  - next(object_3, object_6) is now true.
  - next(object_3, object_5) is now false.

Step 4 — t = 3 → 4
Action: tightfisted object_9 object_3 object_6
- Preconditions checked:
  - hand object_9 — still true.
  - sneeze object_3 — true.
  - texture object_6 — true.
  - next object_3 object_6 — true (added in Step 3).
  - vase object_9 object_3 — true (added in Step 1).
- Effects applied:
  - Add: next object_9 object_6.
  - Delete: vase object_9 object_3.
- Resulting relevant predicates after step:
  - next(object_9, object_6) is now true.
  - vase(object_9, object_3) is now false (removed).

Step 5 — t = 4 → 5
Action: tightfisted object_10 object_3 object_6
- Preconditions checked:
  - hand object_10 — still true.
  - sneeze object_3 — true.
  - texture object_6 — true.
  - next object_3 object_6 — true.
  - vase object_10 object_3 — true (added in Step 2).
- Effects applied:
  - Add: next object_10 object_6.
  - Delete: vase object_10 object_3.
- Resulting relevant predicates after step:
  - next(object_10, object_6) is now true.
  - vase(object_10, object_3) is now false (removed).

Final assessment (t = 5)
- Goal predicates now:
  - next object_10 object_6 — true (added in Step 5).
  - next object_9 object_6 — true (added in Step 4).
- Both goal conjuncts hold. The provided plan (the five actions listed, executed in the given order) is applicable at each step under the domain action definitions and initial facts, and it achieves the stated goal. Total actions: 5; total time (assuming 1 unit per action): 5 time units.
