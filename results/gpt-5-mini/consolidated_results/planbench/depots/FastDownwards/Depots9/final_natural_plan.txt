Step 1 — Time 0 → 1 (duration 1)
Action: hoist_lift(hoist3, crate2, pallet3) at distributor0
Agent: hoist_operator (hoist3)
Preconditions checked at time 0:
- hoist3 is at distributor0
- pallet3 is at distributor0
- crate2 is on pallet3 and crate2 is clear
- hoist3 is available
Effect (applied at time 1):
- crate2 is no longer on pallet3
- crate2 is no longer recorded at distributor0
- hoist3 becomes unavailable
- hoist3 is now lifting crate2
- pallet3 becomes clear (crate removed)
Resulting state summary at time 1:
- hoist3 lifting crate2, hoist3 unavailable
- crate2 not on pallet3 and not at distributor0

Step 2 — Time 1 → 2 (duration 1)
Action: hoist_load(hoist3, crate2, truck0) at distributor0
Agent: hoist_operator (hoist3)
Preconditions checked at time 1:
- hoist3 is at distributor0
- truck0 is at distributor0
- hoist3 is lifting crate2
Effect (applied at time 2):
- crate2 is placed in truck0 (in crate2 truck0)
- hoist3 stops lifting crate2
- hoist3 becomes available again
- crate2 is no longer at distributor0
Resulting state summary at time 2:
- crate2 is in truck0
- hoist3 available and not lifting

Step 3 — Time 2 → 3 (duration 1)
Action: drive(truck0, distributor0 → depot0)
Agent: truck_driver (truck0)
Preconditions checked at time 2:
- truck0 is at distributor0
Effect (applied at time 3):
- truck0 is no longer at distributor0
- truck0 is at depot0
Resulting state summary at time 3:
- truck0 located at depot0 carrying crate2 inside

Step 4 — Time 3 → 4 (duration 1)
Action: hoist_unload(hoist0, crate2, truck0) at depot0
Agent: hoist_operator (hoist0)
Preconditions checked at time 3:
- hoist0 is at depot0
- truck0 is at depot0
- hoist0 is available
- crate2 is in truck0
Effect (applied at time 4):
- crate2 is removed from truck0 (no longer in truck0)
- hoist0 becomes unavailable
- hoist0 is now lifting crate2
- crate2 is not recorded at depot0 while being lifted
Resulting state summary at time 4:
- hoist0 lifting crate2, hoist0 unavailable
- crate2 held by hoist0 (not in truck0)

Step 5 — Time 4 → 5 (duration 1)
Action: hoist_drop(hoist0, crate2, pallet0) at depot0
Agent: hoist_operator (hoist0)
Preconditions checked at time 4:
- hoist0 is at depot0
- pallet0 is at depot0 and clear
- hoist0 is lifting crate2
Effect (applied at time 5):
- hoist0 stops lifting crate2
- hoist0 becomes available
- crate2 is at depot0
- crate2 is on pallet0
- pallet0 becomes not clear
- crate2 is clear (top surface)
Resulting state summary at time 5:
- crate2 on pallet0 at depot0
- hoist0 available

Final check (time 5):
Goal required:
- on(crate0, pallet1) — satisfied (unchanged from init)
- on(crate1, pallet2) — satisfied (unchanged from init)
- on(crate2, pallet0) — satisfied (achieved at Step 5)

All five plan actions were executed in sequence. Each action took 1 time unit (stage → successor stage). The final goal is satisfied at time 5.
