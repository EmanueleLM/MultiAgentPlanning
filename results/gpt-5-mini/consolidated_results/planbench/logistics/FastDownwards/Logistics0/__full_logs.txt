PROBLEM
------------------------------
I have to plan logistics to transport packages within cities via trucks and between cities via airplanes. Locations within a city are directly connected (trucks can move between any two such locations), and so are the cities. In each city there is exactly one truck and each city has one location that serves as an airport.
Here are the actions that can be performed:

Load a package into a truck. For example, load package_1 into truck_1 at location_1_1.
Load a package into an airplane. For example, load package_1 into airplane_1 at location_1_1.
Unload a package from a truck. For example, unload package_1 from truck_1 at location_1_1.
Unload a package from an airplane. For example, unload package_1 from airplane_1 at location_1_1.
Drive a truck from one location to another location. For example, drive truck_1 from location_1_1 to location_1_2 in city_1.
Fly an airplane from one city to another city. For example, fly airplane_1 from location_1_1 to location_2_1. Here location_1_1 is the airport in city_1 and location_2_1 is the airport in city_2.

The following are the restrictions on the actions:
A package can be loaded into a truck only if the package and the truck are in the same location.
Once a package is loaded into a truck, the package is not at the location and is in the truck.   
A package can be loaded into an airplane only if the package and the airplane are in the same location.
Once a package is loaded into an airplane, the package is not at the location and is in the airplane.
A package can be unloaded from a truck only if the package is in the truck.
Once a package is unloaded from a truck, the package is not in the truck and is at the location of the truck.
A package can be unloaded from an airplane only if the package in the airplane.
Once a package is unloaded from an airplane, the package is not in the airplane and is at the location of the airplane.   
A truck can be driven from one location to another if the truck is at the from-location and both from-location and to-location are locations in the same city.
Once a truck is driven from one location to another, it is not at the from-location and is at the to-location.
An airplane can be flown from one city to another if the from-location and the to-location are airports and the airplane is at the from-location.
Once an airplane is flown from one city to another the airplane is not at the from-location and is at the to-location.

[STATEMENT]
As initial conditions I have that, location_0_0 is an airport, location_1_0 is an airport, airplane_0 is at location_1_0, airplane_1 is at location_1_0, package_0 is at location_1_0, truck_0 is at location_0_0, truck_1 is at location_1_0, location_0_0 is in the city city_0 and location_1_0 is in the city city_1.
My goal is to have that package_0 is at location_0_0.

My plan is as follows:

ENVIRONMENT
------------------------------
I have to plan logistics to transport packages within cities via trucks and between cities via airplanes. Locations within a city are directly connected (trucks can move between any two such locations), and so are the cities. In each city there is exactly one truck and each city has one location that serves as an airport.
Here are the actions that can be performed:

Load a package into a truck. For example, load package_1 into truck_1 at location_1_1.
Load a package into an airplane. For example, load package_1 into airplane_1 at location_1_1.
Unload a package from a truck. For example, unload package_1 from truck_1 at location_1_1.
Unload a package from an airplane. For example, unload package_1 from airplane_1 at location_1_1.
Drive a truck from one location to another location. For example, drive truck_1 from location_1_1 to location_1_2 in city_1.
Fly an airplane from one city to another city. For example, fly airplane_1 from location_1_1 to location_2_1. Here location_1_1 is the airport in city_1 and location_2_1 is the airport in city_2.

The following are the restrictions on the actions:
A package can be loaded into a truck only if the package and the truck are in the same location.
Once a package is loaded into a truck, the package is not at the location and is in the truck.   
A package can be loaded into an airplane only if the package and the airplane are in the same location.
Once a package is loaded into an airplane, the package is not at the location and is in the airplane.
A package can be unloaded from a truck only if the package is in the truck.
Once a package is unloaded from a truck, the package is not in the truck and is at the location of the truck.
A package can be unloaded from an airplane only if the package in the airplane.
Once a package is unloaded from an airplane, the package is not in the airplane and is at the location of the airplane.   
A truck can be driven from one location to another if the truck is at the from-location and both from-location and to-location are locations in the same city.
Once a truck is driven from one location to another, it is not at the from-location and is at the to-location.
An airplane can be flown from one city to another if the from-location and the to-location are airports and the airplane is at the from-location.
Once an airplane is flown from one city to another the airplane is not at the from-location and is at the to-location.

As initial conditions I have that, location_0_0 is an airport, location_1_0 is an airport, airplane_0 is at location_1_0, airplane_1 is at location_1_0, package_0 is at location_1_0, truck_0 is at location_0_0, truck_1 is at location_1_0, location_0_0 is in the city city_0 and location_1_0 is in the city city_1.
My goal is to have that package_0 is at location_0_0.

My plan is as follows:

Locations within a city are directly connected (trucks can move between any two such locations), and so are the cities. In each city there is exactly one truck and each city has one location that serves as an airport.\nHere are the actions that can be performed:\n\nLoad a package into a truck. For example, load package_1 into truck_1 at location_1_1.\nLoad a package into an airplane. For example, load package_1 into airplane_1 at location_1_1.\nUnload a package from a truck. For example, unload package_1 from truck_1 at location_1_1.\nUnload a package from an airplane. For example, unload package_1 from airplane_1 at location_1_1.\nDrive a truck from one location to another location. For example, drive truck_1 from location_1_1 to location_1_2 in city_1.\nFly an airplane from one city to another city. For example, fly airplane_1 from location_1_1 to location_2_1. Here location_1_1 is the airport in city_1 and location_2_1 is the airport in city_2.\n\nThe following are the restrictions on the actions:\nA package can be loaded into a truck only if the package and the truck are in the same location.\nOnce a package is loaded into a truck, the package is not at the location and is in the truck.   \nA package can be loaded into an airplane only if the package and the airplane are in the same location.\nOnce a package is loaded into an airplane, the package is not at the location and is in the airplane.\nA package can be unloaded from a truck only if the package is in the truck.\nOnce a package is unloaded from a truck, the package is not in the truck and is at the location of the truck.\nA package can be unloaded from an airplane only if the package in the airplane.\nOnce a package is unloaded from an airplane, the package is not in the airplane and is at the location of the airplane.   \nA truck can be driven from one location to another if the truck is at the from-location and both from-location and to-location are locations in the same city.\nOnce a truck is driven from one location to another, it is not at the from-location and is at the to-location.\nAn airplane can be flown from one city to another if the from-location and the to-location are airports and the airplane is at the from-location.\nOnce an airplane is flown from one city to another the airplane is not at the from-location and is at the to-location.\n\n[STATEMENT]\nAs initial conditions I have that, location_0_0 is an airport, location_1_0 is an airport, airplane_0 is at location_1_0, airplane_1 is at location_1_0, package_0 is at location_1_0, truck_0 is at location_0_0, truck_1 is at location_1_0, location_0_0 is in the city city_0 and location_1_0 is in the city city_1.\nMy goal is to have that package_0 is at location_0_0.\n\nMy plan is as follows:\n\n[PLAN]",

    "human_specification": "I have to plan logistics to transport packages within cities via trucks and between cities via airplanes. Locations within a city are directly connected (trucks can move between any two such locations), and so are the cities. In each city there is exactly one truck and each city has one location that serves as an airport.\nHere are the actions that can be performed:\n\nLoad a package into a truck. For example, load package_1 into truck_1 at location_1_1.\nLoad a package into an airplane. For example, load package_1 into airplane_1 at location_1_1.\nUnload a package from a truck. For example, unload package_1 from truck_1 at location_1_1.\nUnload a package from an airplane. For example, unload package_1 from airplane_1 at location_1_1.\nDrive a truck from one location to another location. For example, drive truck_1 from location_1_1 to location_1_2 in city_1.\nFly an airplane from one city to another city. For example, fly airplane_1 from location_1_1 to location_2_1. Here location_1_1 is the airport in city_1 and location_2_1 is the airport in city_2.\n\nThe following are the restrictions on the actions:\nA package can be loaded into a truck only if the package and the truck are in the same location.\nOnce a package is loaded into a truck, the package is not at the location and is in the truck.   \nA package can be loaded into an airplane only if the package and the airplane are in the same location.\nOnce a package is loaded into an airplane, the package is not at the location and is in the airplane.\nA package can be unloaded from a truck only if the package is in the truck.\nOnce a package is unloaded from a truck, the package is not in the truck and is at the location of the truck.\nA package can be unloaded from an airplane only if the package in the airplane.\nOnce a package is unloaded from an airplane, the package is not in the airplane and is at the location of the airplane.   \nA truck can be driven from one location to another if the truck is at the from-location and both from-location and to-location are locations in the same city.\nOnce a truck is driven from one location to another, it is not at the from-location and is at the to-location.\nAn airplane can be flown from one city to another if the from-location and the to-location are airports and the airplane is at the from-location.\nOnce an airplane is flown from one city to another the airplane is not at the from-location and is at the to-location.\n\n[STATEMENT]\nAs initial conditions I have that, location_0_0 is an airport, location_1_0 is an airport, airplane_0 is at location_1_0, airplane_1 is at location_1_0, package_0 is at location_1_0, truck_0 is at location_0_0, truck_1 is at location_1_0, location_0_0 is in the city city_0 and location_1_0 is in the city city_1.\nMy goal is to have that package_0 is at location_0_0.\n\nMy plan is as follows:\n\n[PLAN]",

    "human_specification": "I have to plan logistics to transport packages within cities via trucks and between cities via airplanes. Locations within a city are directly connected (trucks can move between any two such locations), and so are the cities. In each city there is exactly one truck and each city has one location that serves as an airport.\nHere are the actions that can be performed:\n\nLoad a package into a truck. For example, load package_1 into truck_1 at location_1_1.\nLoad a package into an airplane. For example, load package_1 into airplane_1 at location_1_1.\nUnload a package from a truck. For example, unload package_1 from truck_1 at location_1_1.\nUnload a package from an airplane. For example, unload package_1 from airplane_1 at location_1_1.\nDrive a truck from one location to another location. For example, drive truck_1 from location_1_1 to location_1_2 in city_1.\nFly an airplane from one city to another city. For example, fly airplane_1 from location_1_1 to location_2_1. Here location_1_1 is the airport in city_1 and location_2_1 is the airport in city_2.\n\nThe following are the restrictions on the actions:\nA package can be loaded into a truck only if the package and the truck are in the same location.\nOnce a package is loaded into a truck, the package is not at the location and is in the truck.   \nA package can be loaded into an airplane only if the package and the airplane are in the same location.\nOnce a package is loaded into an airplane, the package is not at the location and is in the airplane.\nA package can be unloaded from a truck only if the package is in the truck.\nOnce a package is unloaded from a truck, the package is not in the truck and is at the location of the truck.\nA package can be unloaded from an airplane only if the package in the airplane.\nOnce a package is unloaded from an airplane, the package is not in the airplane and is at the location of the airplane.   \nA truck can be driven from one location to another if the truck is at the from-location and both from-location and to-location are locations in the same city.\nOnce a truck is driven from one location to another, it is not at the from-location and is at the to-location.\nAn airplane can be flown from one city to another if the from-location and the to-location are airports and the airplane is at the from-location.\nOnce an airplane is flown from one city to another the airplane is not at the from-location and is at the to-location.\n\n[STATEMENT]\nAs initial conditions I have that, location_0_0 is an airport, location_1_0 is an airport, airplane_0 is at location_1_0, airplane_1 is at location_1_0, package_0 is at location_1_0, truck_0 is at location_0_0, truck_1 is at location_1_0, location_0_0 is in the city city_0 and location_1_0 is in the city city_1.\nMy goal is to have that package_0 is at location_0_0.\n\nMy plan is as follows:\n\n[PLAN]",

    "human_specification": "I have to plan logistics to transport packages within cities via trucks and between cities via airplanes. Locations within a city are directly connected (trucks can move between any two such locations), and so are the cities. In each city there is exactly one truck and each city has one location that serves as an airport.\nHere are the actions that can be performed:\n\nLoad a package into a truck. For example, load package_1 into truck_1 at location_1_1.\nLoad a package into an airplane. For example, load package_1 into airplane_1 at location_1_1.\nUnload a package from a truck. For example, unload package_1 from truck_1 at location_1_1.\nUnload a package from an airplane.

    "human_specification": "I have to plan logistics to transport packages within cities via trucks and between cities via airplanes. Locations within a city are directly connected (trucks can move between any two such locations), and so are the cities. In each city there is exactly one truck and each city has one location that serves as an airport.\nHere are the actions that can be performed:\n\nLoad a package into a truck. For example, load package_1 into truck_1 at location_1_1.\nLoad a package into an airplane. For example, load package_1 into airplane_1 at location_1_1.\nUnload a package from a truck. For example, unload package_1 from truck_1 at location_1_1.\nUnload a package from an airplane. For example, unload package_1 from airplane_1 at location_1_1.\nDrive a truck from one location to another location. For example, drive truck_1 from location_1_1 to location_1_2 in city_1.\nFly an airplane from one city to another city. For example, fly airplane_1 from location_1_1 to location_2_1. Here location_1_1 is the airport in city_1 and location_2_1 is the airport in city_2.\n\nThe following are the restrictions on the actions:\nA package can be loaded into a truck only if the package and the truck are in the same location.\nOnce a package is loaded into a truck, the package is not at the location and is in the truck.   \nA package can be loaded into an airplane only if the package and the airplane are in the same location.\nOnce a package is loaded into an airplane, the package is not at the location and is in the airplane.\nA package can be unloaded from a truck only if the package is in the truck.\nOnce a package is unloaded from a truck, the package is not in the truck and is at the location of the truck.\nA package can be unloaded from an airplane only if the package in the airplane.\nOnce a package is unloaded from an airplane, the package is not in the airplane and is at the location of the airplane.   \nA truck can be driven from one location to another if the truck is at the from-location and both from-location and to-location are locations in the same city.\nOnce a truck is driven from one location to another, it is not at the from-location and is at the to-location.\nAn airplane can be flown from one city to another if the from-location and the to-location are airports and the airplane is at the from-location.\nOnce an airplane is flown from one city to another the airplane is not at the from-location and is at the to-location.\n\n[STATEMENT]\nAs initial conditions I have that, location_0_0 is an airport, location_1_0 is an airport, airplane_0 is at location_1_0, airplane_1 is at location_1_0, package_0 is at location_1_0, truck_0 is at location_0_0, truck_1 is at location_1_0, location_0_0 is in the city city_0 and location_1_0 is in the city city_1.\nMy goal is to have that package_0 is at location_0_0.\n\nMy plan is as follows:\n\n[PLAN]",

NATURAL-PLAN sas_plan_5
------------------------------
Summary assumptions
- Discrete-stage/time model: each action advances the explicit stage marker to its successor. For readability we map each stage-advance to one time unit.
- Timeline: start at t=0. Each action takes 1 time unit (t -> t+1).
- Initial relevant facts at t=0:
  - airport(location_1_0), airport(location_0_0)
  - at-airplane(airplane_0, location_1_0)
  - at-package(package_0, location_1_0)
  - at-truck(truck_1, location_1_0) (not used here)
  - air-route(location_1_0, location_0_0) and the reverse
  - current-stage = stage_0, successor chain stage_0 -> stage_1 -> stage_2 -> stage_3

Plan (matches the provided plan exactly; timestamps and effects shown)

Step 1
- Time: start t=0, end t=1 (duration 1)
- Action: load-airplane(package_0, airplane_0, location_1_0, stage_0, stage_1)
- Preconditions checked at t=0:
  - current-stage = stage_0 (true)
  - successor(stage_0, stage_1) (true)
  - at-package(package_0, location_1_0) (true)
  - at-airplane(airplane_0, location_1_0) (true)
  - airport(location_1_0) (true)
  - not in-airplane(package_0, airplane_0) (true)
- Effects applied at t=1:
  - Remove: at-package(package_0, location_1_0)
  - Add: in-airplane(package_0, airplane_0)
  - Advance stage: current-stage becomes stage_1 (remove current-stage stage_0, add current-stage stage_1)
- State note after step 1 (t=1):
  - in-airplane(package_0, airplane_0)
  - at-airplane(airplane_0, location_1_0)
  - current-stage = stage_1

Step 2
- Time: start t=1, end t=2 (duration 1)
- Action: fly-airplane(airplane_0, location_1_0, location_0_0, stage_1, stage_2)
- Preconditions checked at t=1:
  - current-stage = stage_1 (true)
  - successor(stage_1, stage_2) (true)
  - at-airplane(airplane_0, location_1_0) (true)
  - airport(location_1_0) and airport(location_0_0) (both true)
  - air-route(location_1_0, location_0_0) (true)
- Effects applied at t=2:
  - Remove: at-airplane(airplane_0, location_1_0)
  - Add: at-airplane(airplane_0, location_0_0)
  - Advance stage: current-stage becomes stage_2 (remove stage_1 marker, add stage_2)
- State note after step 2 (t=2):
  - in-airplane(package_0, airplane_0) (package travels with airplane)
  - at-airplane(airplane_0, location_0_0)
  - current-stage = stage_2

Step 3
- Time: start t=2, end t=3 (duration 1)
- Action: unload-airplane(package_0, airplane_0, location_0_0, stage_2, stage_3)
- Preconditions checked at t=2:
  - current-stage = stage_2 (true)
  - successor(stage_2, stage_3) (true)
  - in-airplane(package_0, airplane_0) (true)
  - at-airplane(airplane_0, location_0_0) (true)
  - airport(location_0_0) (true)
- Effects applied at t=3:
  - Remove: in-airplane(package_0, airplane_0)
  - Add: at-package(package_0, location_0_0)
  - Advance stage: current-stage becomes stage_3 (remove stage_2 marker, add stage_3)
- State note after step 3 (t=3):
  - at-package(package_0, location_0_0)
  - current-stage = stage_3

Final outcome
- Goal achieved at t=3: at-package(package_0, location_0_0) is true.
- Total cost (unit-cost per action as in the plan): 3.
