Summary assumptions
- Discrete-stage/time model: each action advances the explicit stage marker to its successor. For readability we map each stage-advance to one time unit.
- Timeline: start at t=0. Each action takes 1 time unit (t -> t+1).
- Initial relevant facts at t=0:
  - airport(location_1_0), airport(location_0_0)
  - at-airplane(airplane_0, location_1_0)
  - at-package(package_0, location_1_0)
  - at-truck(truck_1, location_1_0) (not used here)
  - air-route(location_1_0, location_0_0) and the reverse
  - current-stage = stage_0, successor chain stage_0 -> stage_1 -> stage_2 -> stage_3

Plan (matches the provided plan exactly; timestamps and effects shown)

Step 1
- Time: start t=0, end t=1 (duration 1)
- Action: load-airplane(package_0, airplane_0, location_1_0, stage_0, stage_1)
- Preconditions checked at t=0:
  - current-stage = stage_0 (true)
  - successor(stage_0, stage_1) (true)
  - at-package(package_0, location_1_0) (true)
  - at-airplane(airplane_0, location_1_0) (true)
  - airport(location_1_0) (true)
  - not in-airplane(package_0, airplane_0) (true)
- Effects applied at t=1:
  - Remove: at-package(package_0, location_1_0)
  - Add: in-airplane(package_0, airplane_0)
  - Advance stage: current-stage becomes stage_1 (remove current-stage stage_0, add current-stage stage_1)
- State note after step 1 (t=1):
  - in-airplane(package_0, airplane_0)
  - at-airplane(airplane_0, location_1_0)
  - current-stage = stage_1

Step 2
- Time: start t=1, end t=2 (duration 1)
- Action: fly-airplane(airplane_0, location_1_0, location_0_0, stage_1, stage_2)
- Preconditions checked at t=1:
  - current-stage = stage_1 (true)
  - successor(stage_1, stage_2) (true)
  - at-airplane(airplane_0, location_1_0) (true)
  - airport(location_1_0) and airport(location_0_0) (both true)
  - air-route(location_1_0, location_0_0) (true)
- Effects applied at t=2:
  - Remove: at-airplane(airplane_0, location_1_0)
  - Add: at-airplane(airplane_0, location_0_0)
  - Advance stage: current-stage becomes stage_2 (remove stage_1 marker, add stage_2)
- State note after step 2 (t=2):
  - in-airplane(package_0, airplane_0) (package travels with airplane)
  - at-airplane(airplane_0, location_0_0)
  - current-stage = stage_2

Step 3
- Time: start t=2, end t=3 (duration 1)
- Action: unload-airplane(package_0, airplane_0, location_0_0, stage_2, stage_3)
- Preconditions checked at t=2:
  - current-stage = stage_2 (true)
  - successor(stage_2, stage_3) (true)
  - in-airplane(package_0, airplane_0) (true)
  - at-airplane(airplane_0, location_0_0) (true)
  - airport(location_0_0) (true)
- Effects applied at t=3:
  - Remove: in-airplane(package_0, airplane_0)
  - Add: at-package(package_0, location_0_0)
  - Advance stage: current-stage becomes stage_3 (remove stage_2 marker, add stage_3)
- State note after step 3 (t=3):
  - at-package(package_0, location_0_0)
  - current-stage = stage_3

Final outcome
- Goal achieved at t=3: at-package(package_0, location_0_0) is true.
- Total cost (unit-cost per action as in the plan): 3.
