Plan execution (timestamps in time units; each action duration = 1 time unit; total cost = 4)

Initial facts (t=0)
- cats object_1
- spring object_6
- spring object_7
- hand object_8
- texture object_6
- texture object_7
- next object_1 object_6
- next object_8 object_7
Goal: (next object_8 object_6)

1) t=0 → t=1 : memory object_1 object_6 object_7
- Parameters: c=object_1, s1=object_6, s2=object_7
- Preconditions (checked at t=0): cats object_1 (true), spring object_6 (true), spring object_7 (true), next object_1 object_6 (true)
- Effects applied at t=1:
  - Add: next object_1 object_7
  - Delete: next object_1 object_6
- Relevant facts after step: next object_1 object_7 (added). next object_8 object_7 still true.

2) t=1 → t=2 : sip object_8 object_1 object_7
- Parameters: h=object_8, x=object_1, y=object_7
- Preconditions (checked at t=1): hand object_8 (true), cats object_1 (true), texture object_7 (true), next object_8 object_7 (true), next object_1 object_7 (true)
- Effects applied at t=2:
  - Add: vase object_8 object_1
  - Delete: next object_8 object_7
- Relevant facts after step: vase object_8 object_1 (added). next object_8 object_7 removed. next object_1 object_7 remains.

3) t=2 → t=3 : memory object_1 object_7 object_6
- Parameters: c=object_1, s1=object_7, s2=object_6
- Preconditions (checked at t=2): cats object_1 (true), spring object_7 (true), spring object_6 (true), next object_1 object_7 (true)
- Effects applied at t=3:
  - Add: next object_1 object_6
  - Delete: next object_1 object_7
- Relevant facts after step: next object_1 object_6 (restored). vase object_8 object_1 still present. next object_8 object_7 remains absent.

4) t=3 → t=4 : paltry object_8 object_1 object_6
- Parameters: h=object_8, x=object_1, y=object_6
- Preconditions (checked at t=3): hand object_8 (true), cats object_1 (true), texture object_6 (true), vase object_8 object_1 (true), next object_1 object_6 (true)
- Effects applied at t=4:
  - Add: next object_8 object_6
  - Delete: vase object_8 object_1
- Relevant facts after step: next object_8 object_6 (added). vase object_8 object_1 removed.

Outcome (t=4)
- Goal (next object_8 object_6) is achieved at t=4.
- Total actions: 4, total time/cost: 4 units.
