Goal: establish (next object_8 object_6).

Initial facts (time 0)
- (cats object_1)
- (hand object_8)
- (texture object_6)
- (texture object_7)
- (spring object_6)
- (spring object_7)
- (next object_8 object_7)
- (next object_1 object_7)

Plan (three instantaneous steps, executed in order; timestamps are illustrative units)
1) Time 0 — Action: sip object_8 object_1 object_7
   - Parameters: h = object_8, c = object_1, tex = object_7
   - Preconditions (checked at time 0): (hand object_8), (cats object_1), (texture object_7), (next object_8 object_7), (next object_1 object_7) — all satisfied by the initial state.
   - Effects (apply immediately): add (vase object_8 object_1); remove (next object_8 object_7).
   - State change summary after step 1:
     - Removed: (next object_8 object_7)
     - Added: (vase object_8 object_1)

2) Time 1 — Action: memory object_1 object_7 object_6
   - Parameters: c = object_1, sfrom = object_7, sto = object_6
   - Preconditions (checked at time 1): (cats object_1), (spring object_7), (spring object_6), (next object_1 object_7)
     - All are satisfied: (next object_1 object_7) was in the initial state and has not been removed yet.
   - Effects (apply immediately): add (next object_1 object_6); remove (next object_1 object_7).
   - State change summary after step 2:
     - Removed: (next object_1 object_7)
     - Added: (next object_1 object_6)

3) Time 2 — Action: paltry object_8 object_1 object_6
   - Parameters: h = object_8, c = object_1, tex = object_6
   - Preconditions (checked at time 2): (hand object_8), (cats object_1), (texture object_6), (vase object_8 object_1), (next object_1 object_6)
     - (vase object_8 object_1) was added by step 1 and (next object_1 object_6) was added by step 2 — all preconditions satisfied.
   - Effects (apply immediately): add (next object_8 object_6); remove (vase object_8 object_1).
   - State change summary after step 3:
     - Removed: (vase object_8 object_1)
     - Added: (next object_8 object_6)

Result: After executing the three steps in order, the goal (next object_8 object_6) is achieved.
Plan cost: 3 (unit cost per action).
