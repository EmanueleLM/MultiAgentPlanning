Human-readable execution trace (timestamps correspond to stage indices; each action advances the stage by 1 — duration = 1 stage unit):

1) Time 0 -> 1 (duration 1)
   Action: airplane-fly(airplane_0, from=location_1_0, to=location_0_0)
   Description: Airplane airplane_0 departs location_1_0 (an airport in city_1) and flies to location_0_0 (an airport in city_0).
   Preconditions satisfied: airplane_0 is at location_1_0; both locations are airports; from ≠ to.
   Effects: airplane_0 is now at location_0_0 (and no longer at location_1_0). Current stage becomes stage_1.

2) Time 1 -> 2 (duration 1)
   Action: airplane-load(airplane_0, package_1, location_0_0)
   Description: At location_0_0 (airport), airplane_0 loads package_1 into its cargo.
   Preconditions satisfied: airplane_0 is at location_0_0; package_1 is at location_0_0; location_0_0 is an airport.
   Effects: package_1 is now in-airplane airplane_0 (and no longer at location_0_0). Current stage becomes stage_2.

3) Time 2 -> 3 (duration 1)
   Action: airplane-fly(airplane_0, from=location_0_0, to=location_1_0)
   Description: Airplane airplane_0 flies from location_0_0 (airport) back to location_1_0 (airport).
   Preconditions satisfied: airplane_0 is at location_0_0; both locations are airports; from ≠ to.
   Effects: airplane_0 is now at location_1_0 (and no longer at location_0_0). Current stage becomes stage_3.

4) Time 3 -> 4 (duration 1)
   Action: airplane-unload(airplane_0, package_1, location_1_0)
   Description: At location_1_0 (airport), airplane_0 unloads package_1 onto the location.
   Preconditions satisfied: airplane_0 is at location_1_0; package_1 is in-airplane airplane_0; location_1_0 is an airport.
   Effects: package_1 is now at location_1_0 (and no longer in-airplane airplane_0). Current stage becomes stage_4.

Outcome: After these four actions (total cost = 4 units), package_0 remains at location_1_0 (initially there) and package_1 has been moved to location_1_0, satisfying the goal: both package_0 and package_1 at location_1_0.
