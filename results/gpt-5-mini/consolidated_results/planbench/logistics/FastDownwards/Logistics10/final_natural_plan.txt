Below is a human-readable, step-by-step rendering of the given plan. Each step shows the action, the agent/vehicle, the package(s) affected, the source and destination locations where relevant, and the stage (timestamp) interval during which the action occurs. Each action advances the global stage by one (duration = 1 stage unit).

1. Step 1 — plane-load
   - Action: plane-load(airplane_0, package_0)
   - Location: location_0_0
   - Time: stage_0 → stage_1 (duration 1)
   - Effect: package_0 is loaded into airplane_0 (package_0 is no longer at location_0_0; in-airplane package_0 airplane_0).

2. Step 2 — truck-drive
   - Action: truck-drive(truck_0, location_0_0 → location_0_1)
   - Time: stage_1 → stage_2 (duration 1)
   - Effect: truck_0 moves to location_0_1 (no longer at location_0_0).

3. Step 3 — truck-load
   - Action: truck-load(truck_0, package_2)
   - Location: location_0_1
   - Time: stage_2 → stage_3 (duration 1)
   - Effect: package_2 is loaded into truck_0 (package_2 is no longer at location_0_1; in-truck package_2 truck_0).

4. Step 4 — truck-drive
   - Action: truck-drive(truck_0, location_0_1 → location_0_0)
   - Time: stage_3 → stage_4 (duration 1)
   - Effect: truck_0 moves back to location_0_0 (no longer at location_0_1).

5. Step 5 — truck-unload
   - Action: truck-unload(truck_0, package_2)
   - Location: location_0_0
   - Time: stage_4 → stage_5 (duration 1)
   - Effect: package_2 is unloaded from truck_0 and placed at location_0_0 (no longer in truck_0).

6. Step 6 — plane-load
   - Action: plane-load(airplane_0, package_2)
   - Location: location_0_0
   - Time: stage_5 → stage_6 (duration 1)
   - Effect: package_2 is loaded into airplane_0 (package_2 is no longer at location_0_0; in-airplane package_2 airplane_0).

7. Step 7 — plane-fly
   - Action: plane-fly(airplane_0, location_0_0 → location_1_0)
   - Time: stage_6 → stage_7 (duration 1)
   - Effect: airplane_0 moves to airport location_1_0 (no longer at location_0_0). Packages inside airplane_0 travel with it.

8. Step 8 — plane-unload
   - Action: plane-unload(airplane_0, package_0)
   - Location: location_1_0
   - Time: stage_7 → stage_8 (duration 1)
   - Effect: package_0 is unloaded from airplane_0 and placed at location_1_0 (no longer in airplane_0).

9. Step 9 — plane-unload
   - Action: plane-unload(airplane_0, package_2)
   - Location: location_1_0
   - Time: stage_8 → stage_9 (duration 1)
   - Effect: package_2 is unloaded from airplane_0 and placed at location_1_0 (no longer in airplane_0).

10. Step 10 — truck-drive
    - Action: truck-drive(truck_1, location_1_0 → location_1_1)
    - Time: stage_9 → stage_10 (duration 1)
    - Effect: truck_1 moves to location_1_1 (no longer at location_1_0).

11. Step 11 — truck-load
    - Action: truck-load(truck_1, package_1)
    - Location: location_1_1
    - Time: stage_10 → stage_11 (duration 1)
    - Effect: package_1 is loaded into truck_1 (package_1 is no longer at location_1_1; in-truck package_1 truck_1).

12. Step 12 — truck-drive
    - Action: truck-drive(truck_1, location_1_1 → location_1_0)
    - Time: stage_11 → stage_12 (duration 1)
    - Effect: truck_1 moves to location_1_0 (no longer at location_1_1).

13. Step 13 — truck-unload
    - Action: truck-unload(truck_1, package_1)
    - Location: location_1_0
    - Time: stage_12 → stage_13 (duration 1)
    - Effect: package_1 is unloaded from truck_1 and placed at location_1_0 (no longer in truck_1).

Final state after stage_13:
- package_0 at location_1_0
- package_1 at location_1_0
- package_2 at location_1_0

The global goal is satisfied. (Total plan cost reported in the original plan: 13; each action advanced the stage by one, so 13 stage-steps were used.)
