Below is a clear, step-by-step, human-readable execution of the given plan. Each step shows a timestamp (incremental, 1 time unit per action), the grounded action name and parameters, whether its preconditions held, the concrete effects applied (adds and deletes), and the relevant resulting facts after the step.

Initial relevant facts (from the problem):
- hand: object_10, object_11
- sneeze: object_4, object_5
- texture: object_6, object_7, object_8, object_9
- stupendous: object_2, object_3
- collect: (object_6,object_2), (object_7,object_2), (object_8,object_3), (object_9,object_3)
- next: (object_10,object_6), (object_11,object_9), (object_4,object_6), (object_5,object_8)
- No vase facts initially.

Plan cost: 7 actions, cost = 7 (unit cost). Each step duration: 1 time unit (timestamps shown as t = 0,1,...).

Step 1 — t = 0
Action: wretched object_5 object_8 object_9 object_3
- Parameters: s=object_5, t1=object_8, t2=object_9, st=object_3
- Preconditions checked:
  - (sneeze object_5) — true
  - (texture object_8) — true
  - (texture object_9) — true
  - (stupendous object_3) — true
  - (next object_5 object_8) — true
  - (collect object_8 object_3) — true
  - (collect object_9 object_3) — true
  => All preconditions hold.
- Effects applied:
  - Add: (next object_5 object_9)
  - Delete: (next object_5 object_8)
- Resulting relevant facts (changes only):
  - next: (object_5,object_8) removed; (object_5,object_9) added.

Step 2 — t = 1
Action: clip object_11 object_5 object_9
- Parameters: h=object_11, s=object_5, t=object_9
- Preconditions checked:
  - (hand object_11) — true
  - (sneeze object_5) — true
  - (texture object_9) — true
  - (next object_5 object_9) — true (added in Step 1)
  - (next object_11 object_9) — true (initial)
  => All preconditions hold.
- Effects applied:
  - Add: (vase object_11 object_5)
  - Delete: (next object_11 object_9)
- Resulting relevant facts:
  - vase: (object_11,object_5) added.
  - next: (object_11,object_9) removed.

Step 3 — t = 2
Action: wretched object_5 object_9 object_8 object_3
- Parameters: s=object_5, t1=object_9, t2=object_8, st=object_3
- Preconditions checked:
  - (sneeze object_5) — true
  - (texture object_9) — true
  - (texture object_8) — true
  - (stupendous object_3) — true
  - (next object_5 object_9) — true (from Step 1; still true because Step 2 did not delete it)
  - (collect object_9 object_3) — true
  - (collect object_8 object_3) — true
  => All preconditions hold.
- Effects applied:
  - Add: (next object_5 object_8)
  - Delete: (next object_5 object_9)
- Resulting relevant facts:
  - next: (object_5,object_9) removed; (object_5,object_8) re-added.

Step 4 — t = 3
Action: tightfisted object_11 object_5 object_8
- Parameters: h=object_11, s=object_5, t=object_8
- Preconditions checked:
  - (hand object_11) — true
  - (sneeze object_5) — true
  - (texture object_8) — true
  - (next object_5 object_8) — true (restored in Step 3)
  - (vase object_11 object_5) — true (added in Step 2)
  => All preconditions hold.
- Effects applied:
  - Add: (next object_11 object_8)
  - Delete: (vase object_11 object_5)
- Resulting relevant facts:
  - next: (object_11,object_8) added.
  - vase: (object_11,object_5) removed.

Step 5 — t = 4
Action: clip object_10 object_4 object_6
- Parameters: h=object_10, s=object_4, t=object_6
- Preconditions checked:
  - (hand object_10) — true
  - (sneeze object_4) — true
  - (texture object_6) — true
  - (next object_4 object_6) — true (initial)
  - (next object_10 object_6) — true (initial)
  => All preconditions hold.
- Effects applied:
  - Add: (vase object_10 object_4)
  - Delete: (next object_10 object_6)
- Resulting relevant facts:
  - vase: (object_10,object_4) added.
  - next: (object_10,object_6) removed.

Step 6 — t = 5
Action: wretched object_4 object_6 object_7 object_2
- Parameters: s=object_4, t1=object_6, t2=object_7, st=object_2
- Preconditions checked:
  - (sneeze object_4) — true
  - (texture object_6) — true
  - (texture object_7) — true
  - (stupendous object_2) — true
  - (next object_4 object_6) — true (was initial and not deleted by Step 5; clip in Step 5 deleted next(object_10,object_6) but not next(object_4,object_6))
  - (collect object_6 object_2) — true
  - (collect object_7 object_2) — true
  => All preconditions hold.
- Effects applied:
  - Add: (next object_4 object_7)
  - Delete: (next object_4 object_6)
- Resulting relevant facts:
  - next: (object_4,object_6) removed; (object_4,object_7) added.

Step 7 — t = 6
Action: tightfisted object_10 object_4 object_7
- Parameters: h=object_10, s=object_4, t=object_7
- Preconditions checked:
  - (hand object_10) — true
  - (sneeze object_4) — true
  - (texture object_7) — true
  - (next object_4 object_7) — true (added in Step 6)
  - (vase object_10 object_4) — true (added in Step 5)
  => All preconditions hold.
- Effects applied:
  - Add: (next object_10 object_7)
  - Delete: (vase object_10 object_4)
- Resulting relevant facts:
  - next: (object_10,object_7) added.
  - vase: (object_10,object_4) removed.

Final relevant facts (after all steps), showing goal predicates:
- next object_10 object_7 — present (goal satisfied)
- next object_11 object_8 — present (goal satisfied)
- Other relevant next facts:
  - next object_4 object_7 (present)
  - next object_5 object_8 (present)
- No remaining vase facts for object_10 or object_11 (both were removed after tightfisted actions).

Conclusion:
- The provided sequence of 7 actions is valid, each action’s preconditions were satisfied at execution time, and their effects produced the final state that meets the goal:
  - (next object_10 object_7) and (next object_11 object_8) — both achieved.
- Timestamps: t = 0..6 (1 time unit per action). Total plan cost = 7.
