Below is a step-by-step, human-readable rendering of the supplied PDDL plan. Each step corresponds exactly to one plan action in the given order. For each step I list:
- the action name and its three object parameters (with the role implied by the action schema),
- the stage transition (start_stage → end_stage) and an integer timestamp mapping (stage_n → time n),
- the concrete state changes implied by the domain (which predicates are added and which are removed).
All timestamps use the stage index as the time (stage_0 = time 0, stage_1 = time 1, ...). Each action advances the current stage by one (duration = 1 time unit).

Step 1 — time 0 → 1
Action: sip(object_9, object_0, object_5)
- Roles: object_9 = hand, object_0 = cats, object_5 = texture
- Preconditions used: hand(object_9), cats(object_0), texture(object_5), next(object_9, object_5), next(object_0, object_5)
- Effects (applied at end of step):
  - Added: vase(object_9, object_0)
  - Removed: next(object_9, object_5)
  - Stage: current stage advances stage_0 → stage_1

Step 2 — time 1 → 2

- Roles: object_3 = sneeze (actor), object_5 = texture (source), object_6 = texture (target), object_1 = stupendous (collected)
- Preconditions used: sneeze(object_3), texture(object_5), texture(object_6), stupendous(object_1), next(object_3, object_5), collect(object_5, object_1), collect(object_6, object_1)

Outcome / Goal check
- After Step 13 (time 13), the three goal atoms are true:
  - next(object_10, object_7) — added at Step 13
  - next(object_11, object_7) — added at Step 8
  - next(object_9, object_7) — added at Step 9
- Goal satisfied at time 13.

Plan cost
- The plan length is 13 actions; the plan comment reported cost = 13 (unit cost per action).

Notes
- Each action above is described exactly as in the given plan and in the order provided; no actions were added, removed, or reordered.
- Each action advances the explicit current stage by one (stage_n → stage_{n+1}), so I reported timestamps as integer times n → n+1.
- The reported added/removed predicates are the direct effects defined by the domain action schemas for the given parameter instantiations.
