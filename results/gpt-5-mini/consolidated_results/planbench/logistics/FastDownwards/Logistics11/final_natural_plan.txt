Below is a human-readable, step-by-step rendering of the provided PDDL plan. Each step is listed in order, keeps the original agent-prefixed action name, shows the stage timestamp (sX → sY) and a short note about preconditions and effects. Per the model, each action is instantaneous and costs 1 time unit (plan total cost = 18).

1) Time s0 → s1 (duration 1)

Final state (after s18): the goal is satisfied:
- package_0 is at location_0_1
- package_1 is at location_1_1
- package_2 is at location_1_0

Notes on modeling consistency (brief):
- All truck moves respect same-city connectivity.
- All airplane loads/unloads occur at airports and flights follow declared air-route facts.
- Each action advances the global stage token (sX → sY), matching the plan steps; actions are instantaneous and cost 1 unit each (total cost = 18).
