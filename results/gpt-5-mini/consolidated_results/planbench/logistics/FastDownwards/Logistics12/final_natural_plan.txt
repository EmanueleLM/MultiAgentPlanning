Below is a clear, stepwise, human-readable rendering of the provided PDDL plan. Each step exactly corresponds to one action in the plan (no additions or deletions). For each step I show: the action name and its object arguments, the timestamp (stage_t1 -> stage_t2 as given in the plan), the action's required preconditions (as they must hold immediately before the step), the direct effects (what is added and what is removed), and a short justification of why the preconditions hold at that time (referring to initial facts or effects of earlier steps).

All actions take 1 stage (stage_t1 -> stage_t2).

1) Step 1 — wretched(object_3_s1, object_6_s1, object_5_s1, object_1_s1) at stage_0 -> stage_1
- Preconditions: sneeze(object_3_s1), texture(object_6_s1), texture(object_5_s1), stupendous(object_1_s1), next(object_3_s1,object_6_s1), collect(object_6_s1,object_1_s1), collect(object_5_s1,object_1_s1)
- Effects: add next(object_3_s1,object_5_s1); remove next(object_3_s1,object_6_s1)
- Justification: All preconditions are true in scenario 1 initial state; this changes object_3_s1's next link from object_6_s1 to object_5_s1.

2) Step 2 — wretched(object_4_s1, object_7_s1, object_8_s1, object_2_s1) at stage_1 -> stage_2
- Preconditions: sneeze(object_4_s1), texture(object_7_s1), texture(object_8_s1), stupendous(object_2_s1), next(object_4_s1,object_7_s1), collect(object_7_s1,object_2_s1), collect(object_8_s1,object_2_s1)
- Effects: add next(object_4_s1,object_8_s1); remove next(object_4_s1,object_7_s1)
- Justification: All required predicates present initially for scenario 1; changes object_4_s1's next from object_7_s1 to object_8_s1.

3) Step 3 — clip(object_9_s1, object_4_s1, object_8_s1) at stage_2 -> stage_3
- Preconditions: hand(object_9_s1), sneeze(object_4_s1), texture(object_8_s1), next(object_4_s1,object_8_s1), next(object_9_s1,object_8_s1)
- Effects: add vase(object_9_s1,object_4_s1); remove next(object_9_s1,object_8_s1)
- Justification: object_9_s1 is a hand, object_4_s1 is sneeze, texture present, and step 2 produced next(4_s1,8_s1); next(9_s1,8_s1) existed initially — clip creates a vase relation and removes the next 9->8 link.

4) Step 4 — wretched(object_4_s2, object_7_s2, object_6_s2, object_2_s2) at stage_3 -> stage_4
- Preconditions: sneeze(object_4_s2), texture(object_7_s2), texture(object_6_s2), stupendous(object_2_s2), next(object_4_s2,object_7_s2), collect(object_7_s2,object_2_s2), collect(object_6_s2,object_2_s2)
- Effects: add next(object_4_s2,object_6_s2); remove next(object_4_s2,object_7_s2)
- Justification: These predicates come from scenario 2 initial state; modifies object_4_s2's next link from object_7_s2 to object_6_s2.

5) Step 5 — wretched(object_5_s2, object_8_s2, object_9_s2, object_3_s2) at stage_4 -> stage_5
- Preconditions: sneeze(object_5_s2), texture(object_8_s2), texture(object_9_s2), stupendous(object_3_s2), next(object_5_s2,object_8_s2), collect(object_8_s2,object_3_s2), collect(object_9_s2,object_3_s2)
- Effects: add next(object_5_s2,object_9_s2); remove next(object_5_s2,object_8_s2)
- Justification: Scenario 2 initial facts satisfy preconditions; changes object_5_s2's next from 8_s2 to 9_s2.

6) Step 6 — clip(object_10_s2, object_5_s2, object_9_s2) at stage_5 -> stage_6
- Preconditions: hand(object_10_s2), sneeze(object_5_s2), texture(object_9_s2), next(object_5_s2,object_9_s2), next(object_10_s2,object_9_s2)
- Effects: add vase(object_10_s2,object_5_s2); remove next(object_10_s2,object_9_s2)
- Justification: hand and sneeze predicates hold and step 5 created next(5_s2,9_s2); next(10_s2,9_s2) existed initially — clip creates vase(10_s2,5_s2) and removes next(10_s2,9_s2).

7) Step 7 — memory(object_0_s1, object_5_s1, object_7_s1) at stage_6 -> stage_7
- Preconditions: cats(object_0_s1), spring(object_5_s1), spring(object_7_s1), next(object_0_s1,object_5_s1)
- Effects: add next(object_0_s1,object_7_s1); remove next(object_0_s1,object_5_s1)
- Justification: scenario 1 initial facts supply these predicates; memory moves object_0_s1's next from 5_s1 to 7_s1.

8) Step 8 — sip(object_11_s2, object_0_s2, object_6_s2) at stage_7 -> stage_8
- Preconditions: hand(object_11_s2), cats(object_0_s2), texture(object_6_s2), next(object_11_s2,object_6_s2), next(object_0_s2,object_6_s2)
- Effects: add vase(object_11_s2,object_0_s2); remove next(object_11_s2,object_6_s2)
- Justification: scenario 2 initial facts include these predicates; sip creates vase(11_s2,0_s2) and removes next(11_s2,6_s2).

9) Step 9 — sip(object_12_s2, object_0_s2, object_6_s2) at stage_8 -> stage_9
- Preconditions: hand(object_12_s2), cats(object_0_s2), texture(object_6_s2), next(object_12_s2,object_6_s2), next(object_0_s2,object_6_s2)
- Effects: add vase(object_12_s2,object_0_s2); remove next(object_12_s2,object_6_s2)
- Justification: same reasoning as step 8 for object_12_s2; sip creates vase(12_s2,0_s2) and removes next(12_s2,6_s2).

10) Step 10 — wretched(object_4_s1, object_8_s1, object_7_s1, object_2_s1) at stage_9 -> stage_10
- Preconditions: sneeze(object_4_s1), texture(object_8_s1), texture(object_7_s1), stupendous(object_2_s1), next(object_4_s1,object_8_s1), collect(object_8_s1,object_2_s1), collect(object_7_s1,object_2_s1)
- Effects: add next(object_4_s1,object_7_s1); remove next(object_4_s1,object_8_s1)
- Justification: step 2 created next(4_s1,8_s1); this wretched changes it back to next(4_s1,7_s1).

11) Step 11 — tightfisted(object_9_s1, object_4_s1, object_7_s1) at stage_10 -> stage_11
- Preconditions: hand(object_9_s1), sneeze(object_4_s1), texture(object_7_s1), next(object_4_s1,object_7_s1), vase(object_9_s1,object_4_s1)
- Effects: add next(object_9_s1,object_7_s1); remove vase(object_9_s1,object_4_s1)
- Justification: vase(9_s1,4_s1) was created in step 3; step 10 re-established next(4_s1,7_s1) — together they satisfy tightfisted to create next(9_s1,7_s1).

12) Step 12 — sip(object_9_s1, object_0_s1, object_7_s1) at stage_11 -> stage_12
- Preconditions: hand(object_9_s1), cats(object_0_s1), texture(object_7_s1), next(object_9_s1,object_7_s1), next(object_0_s1,object_7_s1)
- Effects: add vase(object_9_s1,object_0_s1); remove next(object_9_s1,object_7_s1)
- Justification: tightfisted (step 11) created next(9_s1,7_s1); memory (step 7) created next(0_s1,7_s1); sip uses these to create vase(9_s1,0_s1).

13) Step 13 — memory(object_0_s2, object_6_s2, object_8_s2) at stage_12 -> stage_13
- Preconditions: cats(object_0_s2), spring(object_6_s2), spring(object_8_s2), next(object_0_s2,object_6_s2)
- Effects: add next(object_0_s2,object_8_s2); remove next(object_0_s2,object_6_s2)
- Justification: scenario 2 initial facts give these, so object_0_s2's next moves from 6_s2 to 8_s2.

14) Step 14 — paltry(object_11_s2, object_0_s2, object_8_s2) at stage_13 -> stage_14
- Preconditions: hand(object_11_s2), cats(object_0_s2), texture(object_8_s2), vase(object_11_s2,object_0_s2), next(object_0_s2,object_8_s2)
- Effects: add next(object_11_s2,object_8_s2); remove vase(object_11_s2,object_0_s2)
- Justification: step 8 created vase(11_s2,0_s2), and step 13 created next(0_s2,8_s2); paltry establishes next(11_s2,8_s2).

15) Step 15 — paltry(object_12_s2, object_0_s2, object_8_s2) at stage_14 -> stage_15
- Preconditions: hand(object_12_s2), cats(object_0_s2), texture(object_8_s2), vase(object_12_s2,object_0_s2), next(object_0_s2,object_8_s2)
- Effects: add next(object_12_s2,object_8_s2); remove vase(object_12_s2,object_0_s2)
- Justification: step 9 created vase(12_s2,0_s2), step 13 created next(0_s2,8_s2); paltry creates next(12_s2,8_s2). This achieves scenario 2 goal for object_12_s2 -> object_8_s2.

16) Step 16 — wretched(object_5_s2, object_9_s2, object_8_s2, object_3_s2) at stage_15 -> stage_16
- Preconditions: sneeze(object_5_s2), texture(object_9_s2), texture(object_8_s2), stupendous(object_3_s2), next(object_5_s2,object_9_s2), collect(object_9_s2,object_3_s2), collect(object_8_s2,object_3_s2)
- Effects: add next(object_5_s2,object_8_s2); remove next(object_5_s2,object_9_s2)
- Justification: step 5 had changed next(5_s2,8_s2)->9_s2 and step 5 produced next(5_s2,9_s2); this wretched flips it back to next(5_s2,8_s2).

17) Step 17 — tightfisted(object_10_s2, object_5_s2, object_8_s2) at stage_16 -> stage_17
- Preconditions: hand(object_10_s2), sneeze(object_5_s2), texture(object_8_s2), next(object_5_s2,object_8_s2), vase(object_10_s2,object_5_s2)
- Effects: add next(object_10_s2,object_8_s2); remove vase(object_10_s2,object_5_s2)
- Justification: step 6 created vase(10_s2,5_s2); step 16 created next(5_s2,8_s2); tightfisted yields next(10_s2,8_s2).

18) Step 18 — clip(object_11_s2, object_5_s2, object_8_s2) at stage_17 -> stage_18
- Preconditions: hand(object_11_s2), sneeze(object_5_s2), texture(object_8_s2), next(object_5_s2,object_8_s2), next(object_11_s2,object_8_s2)
- Effects: add vase(object_11_s2,object_5_s2); remove next(object_11_s2,object_8_s2)
- Justification: paltry (step 14) created next(11_s2,8_s2); step 16 created next(5_s2,8_s2); clip makes vase(11_s2,5_s2) and removes next(11_s2,8_s2).

19) Step 19 — wretched(object_5_s2, object_8_s2, object_9_s2, object_3_s2) at stage_18 -> stage_19
- Preconditions: sneeze(object_5_s2), texture(object_8_s2), texture(object_9_s2), stupendous(object_3_s2), next(object_5_s2,object_8_s2), collect(object_8_s2,object_3_s2), collect(object_9_s2,object_3_s2)
- Effects: add next(object_5_s2,object_9_s2); remove next(object_5_s2,object_8_s2)
- Justification: step 16 gave next(5_s2,8_s2); this wretched flips it to next(5_s2,9_s2) again (used to enable subsequent tightfisted).

20) Step 20 — tightfisted(object_11_s2, object_5_s2, object_9_s2) at stage_19 -> stage_20
- Preconditions: hand(object_11_s2), sneeze(object_5_s2), texture(object_9_s2), next(object_5_s2,object_9_s2), vase(object_11_s2,object_5_s2)
- Effects: add next(object_11_s2,object_9_s2); remove vase(object_11_s2,object_5_s2)
- Justification: clip (step 18) created vase(11_s2,5_s2) and step 19 produced next(5_s2,9_s2); tightfisted yields next(11_s2,9_s2). This achieves scenario 2: next object_11_s2 -> object_9_s2.

21) Step 21 — sip(object_10_s2, object_0_s2, object_8_s2) at stage_20 -> stage_21
- Preconditions: hand(object_10_s2), cats(object_0_s2), texture(object_8_s2), next(object_10_s2,object_8_s2), next(object_0_s2,object_8_s2)
- Effects: add vase(object_10_s2,object_0_s2); remove next(object_10_s2,object_8_s2)
- Justification: step 17 created next(10_s2,8_s2), and step 13 created next(0_s2,8_s2); sip makes vase(10_s2,0_s2).

22) Step 22 — memory(object_0_s2, object_8_s2, object_6_s2) at stage_21 -> stage_22
- Preconditions: cats(object_0_s2), spring(object_8_s2), spring(object_6_s2), next(object_0_s2,object_8_s2)
- Effects: add next(object_0_s2,object_6_s2); remove next(object_0_s2,object_8_s2)
- Justification: step 13 created next(0_s2,8_s2); memory flips object_0_s2's next back to object_6_s2.

23) Step 23 — paltry(object_10_s2, object_0_s2, object_6_s2) at stage_22 -> stage_23
- Preconditions: hand(object_10_s2), cats(object_0_s2), texture(object_6_s2), vase(object_10_s2,object_0_s2), next(object_0_s2,object_6_s2)
- Effects: add next(object_10_s2,object_6_s2); remove vase(object_10_s2,object_0_s2)
- Justification: step 21 created vase(10_s2,0_s2); step 22 created next(0_s2,6_s2); paltry produces next(10_s2,6_s2).

- Preconditions: hand(object_10_s2), sneeze(object_4_s2), texture(object_6_s2), next(object_4_s2,object_6_s2), next(object_10_s2,object_6_s2)
- Effects: add vase(object_10_s2,object_4_s2); remove next(object_10_s2,object_6_s2)
- Justification: step 4 set next(4_s2,6_s2); step 23 created next(10_s2,6_s2); clip creates vase(10_s2,4_s2).

25) Step 25 — wretched(object_4_s2, object_6_s2, object_7_s2, object_2_s2) at stage_24 -> stage_25
- Preconditions: sneeze(object_4_s2), texture(object_6_s2), texture(object_7_s2), stupendous(object_2_s2), next(object_4_s2,object_6_s2), collect(object_6_s2,object_2_s2), collect(object_7_s2,object_2_s2)
- Effects: add next(object_4_s2,object_7_s2); remove next(object_4_s2,object_6_s2)
- Justification: step 4 had set next(4_s2,6_s2); this wretched flips it back to next(4_s2,7_s2).

26) Step 26 — tightfisted(object_10_s2, object_4_s2, object_7_s2) at stage_25 -> stage_26
- Preconditions: hand(object_10_s2), sneeze(object_4_s2), texture(object_7_s2), next(object_4_s2,object_7_s2), vase(object_10_s2,object_4_s2)
- Effects: add next(object_10_s2,object_7_s2); remove vase(object_10_s2,object_4_s2)
- Justification: step 25 created next(4_s2,7_s2), and step 24 created vase(10_s2,4_s2); tightfisted yields next(10_s2,7_s2). This achieves scenario 2 goal next object_10_s2 -> object_7_s2.

27) Step 27 — memory(object_0_s1, object_7_s1, object_5_s1) at stage_26 -> stage_27

29) Step 29 — sip(object_11_s1, object_0_s1, object_5_s1) at stage_28 -> stage_29
- Preconditions: hand(object_11_s1), cats(object_0_s1), texture(object_5_s1), next(object_11_s1,object_5_s1), next(object_0_s1,object_5_s1)
- Effects: add vase(object_11_s1,object_0_s1); remove next(object_11_s1,object_5_s1)
- Justification: initial next(11_s1,5_s1) existed and step 27 created next(0_s1,5_s1); sip makes vase(11_s1,0_s1).

32) Step 32 — wretched(object_3_s1, object_5_s1, object_6_s1, object_1_s1) at stage_31 -> stage_32
- Preconditions: sneeze(object_3_s1), texture(object_5_s1), texture(object_6_s1), stupendous(object_1_s1), next(object_3_s1,object_5_s1), collect(object_5_s1,object_1_s1), collect(object_6_s1,object_1_s1)
- Effects: add next(object_3_s1,object_6_s1); remove next(object_3_s1,object_5_s1)
- Justification: earlier (step 1) had set next(3_s1,5_s1); step 31 still used that next; this wretched returns object_3_s1's next to object_6_s1 (undoing step 1).

33) Step 33 — tightfisted(object_9_s1, object_3_s1, object_6_s1) at stage_32 -> stage_33
- Preconditions: hand(object_9_s1), sneeze(object_3_s1), texture(object_6_s1), next(object_3_s1,object_6_s1), vase(object_9_s1,object_3_s1)

- Justification: step 32 created next(3_s1,6_s1) and step 31 created vase(9_s1,3_s1); tightfisted yields next(9_s1,6_s1). This achieves scenario 1 goal next object_9_s1 -> object_6_s1.

34) Step 34 — memory(object_0_s1, object_5_s1, object_7_s1) at stage_33 -> stage_34
- Preconditions: cats(object_0_s1), spring(object_5_s1), spring(object_7_s1), next(object_0_s1,object_5_s1)
- Effects: add next(object_0_s1,object_7_s1); remove next(object_0_s1,object_5_s1)
- Justification: step 27 had set next(0_s1,5_s1); memory flips it again to next(0_s1,7_s1).

- Preconditions: hand(object_10_s1), cats(object_0_s1), texture(object_7_s1), vase(object_10_s1,object_0_s1), next(object_0_s1,object_7_s1)
- Effects: add next(object_10_s1,object_7_s1); remove vase(object_10_s1,object_0_s1)
- Justification: step 28 created vase(10_s1,0_s1) and step 34 created next(0_s1,7_s1); paltry makes next(10_s1,7_s1).

36) Step 36 — clip(object_10_s1, object_4_s1, object_7_s1) at stage_35 -> stage_36
- Preconditions: hand(object_10_s1), sneeze(object_4_s1), texture(object_7_s1), next(object_4_s1,object_7_s1), next(object_10_s1,object_7_s1)
- Effects: add vase(object_10_s1,object_4_s1); remove next(object_10_s1,object_7_s1)
- Justification: step 10 created next(4_s1,7_s1) and step 35 created next(10_s1,7_s1); clip creates vase(10_s1,4_s1).

37) Step 37 — wretched(object_4_s1, object_7_s1, object_8_s1, object_2_s1) at stage_36 -> stage_37
- Preconditions: sneeze(object_4_s1), texture(object_7_s1), texture(object_8_s1), stupendous(object_2_s1), next(object_4_s1,object_7_s1), collect(object_7_s1,object_2_s1), collect(object_8_s1,object_2_s1)
- Effects: add next(object_4_s1,object_8_s1); remove next(object_4_s1,object_7_s1)
- Justification: step 10 had produced next(4_s1,7_s1) and it remained true for step 36; this wretched now flips next(4_s1,7_s1) back to next(4_s1,8_s1).

38) Step 38 — tightfisted(object_10_s1, object_4_s1, object_8_s1) at stage_37 -> stage_38
- Preconditions: hand(object_10_s1), sneeze(object_4_s1), texture(object_8_s1), next(object_4_s1,object_8_s1), vase(object_10_s1,object_4_s1)
- Effects: add next(object_10_s1,object_8_s1); remove vase(object_10_s1,object_4_s1)
- Justification: step 36 created vase(10_s1,4_s1) and step 37 created next(4_s1,8_s1); tightfisted yields next(10_s1,8_s1). This achieves scenario 1 goal next object_10_s1 -> object_8_s1.

39) Step 39 — paltry(object_11_s1, object_0_s1, object_7_s1) at stage_38 -> stage_39
- Preconditions: hand(object_11_s1), cats(object_0_s1), texture(object_7_s1), vase(object_11_s1,object_0_s1), next(object_0_s1,object_7_s1)
- Effects: add next(object_11_s1,object_7_s1); remove vase(object_11_s1,object_0_s1)
- Justification: step 29 created vase(11_s1,0_s1) and step 34 created next(0_s1,7_s1); paltry produces next(11_s1,7_s1). This achieves scenario 1 goal next object_11_s1 -> object_7_s1.

Summary: executing these 39 actions in the listed stage order yields the final goal facts:
- For scenario 1: next(object_10_s1,object_8_s1) (step 38), next(object_11_s1,object_7_s1) (step 39), next(object_9_s1,object_6_s1) (step 33).
- For scenario 2: next(object_10_s2,object_7_s2) (step 26), next(object_11_s2,object_9_s2) (step 20), next(object_12_s2,object_8_s2) (step 15).

All steps and timestamps match the supplied PDDL plan exactly; preconditions and effects reported follow the public domain action definitions.
