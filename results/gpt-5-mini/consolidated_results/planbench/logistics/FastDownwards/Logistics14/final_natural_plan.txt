Summary of scenario
- Objects (items): object_0 … object_12.
- Stage sequence (timestamps): start -> stage_0 -> stage_1 -> … -> stage_14. Each action consumes one stage availability token; we report the target stage as the action timestamp. Assume each action takes one time unit and occurs at the indicated stage (e.g., action using stage_0 happens at timestamp "stage_0").
- Initial true ground predicates (selected from the problem's :init):
  - cats: object_0, object_1
  - collect: (object_6, object_2), (object_7, object_2), (object_8, object_3), (object_9, object_3)
  - hand: object_10, object_11, object_12
  - next: (object_0, object_8), (object_1, object_6), (object_10, object_8), (object_11, object_9), (object_12, object_6), (object_4, object_6), (object_5, object_9)
  - sneeze: object_4, object_5
  - spring: object_6, object_8
  - stupendous: object_2, object_3
  - texture: object_6, object_7, object_8, object_9
  - Stage availability: available stage_0 … available stage_14 (start is intentionally NOT available)
  - Succession (start -> stage_0 -> stage_1 -> … -> stage_14) is present.

Goal
- next object_10 object_7
- next object_11 object_7
- next object_12 object_7

Causal execution trace — step-by-step (each step lists the grounded action, timestamp (stage), required preconditions, effects (added / deleted), and a short causal note). Every precondition below is supported either by the initial facts or by previous actions' effects.

1) Action: sip object_10 object_0 object_8
   - Timestamp: stage_0 (requires succ start stage_0 and available stage_0; start must be not-available — satisfied)
   - Preconditions (ground):
     - hand(object_10)
     - cats(object_0)
     - texture(object_8)
     - next(object_10, object_8)
     - next(object_0, object_8)
     - succ(start, stage_0)
     - available(stage_0)
     - not available(start)
   - Effects:
     - Added: vase(object_10, object_0)
     - Deleted: next(object_10, object_8)
     - Deleted: available(stage_0)
   - Causal note: uses object_10 holding and the shared "next … object_8" relation to create a vase linking object_10 to object_0, and consumes the stage_0 token.

2) Action: clip object_12 object_4 object_6
   - Timestamp: stage_1 (succ stage_0 stage_1; requires available stage_1 and not available stage_0 — stage_0 was consumed by step 1)
   - Preconditions:
     - hand(object_12)
     - sneeze(object_4)
     - texture(object_6)
     - next(object_4, object_6)
     - next(object_12, object_6)

     - available(stage_1)
     - not available(stage_0)
   - Effects:
     - Added: vase(object_12, object_4)
     - Deleted: next(object_12, object_6)
     - Deleted: available(stage_1)

     - Added: vase(object_11, object_5)
     - Deleted: next(object_11, object_9)

4) Action: wretched object_5 object_9 object_8 object_3
   - Timestamp: stage_3 (succ stage_2 stage_3; stage_2 was consumed)
   - Preconditions:

   - Effects:
     - Added: next(object_5, object_8)
     - Deleted: next(object_5, object_9)
     - Deleted: available(stage_3)
   - Causal note: rewires object_5's next pointer from object_9 to object_8 by using the collect relations that reference object_3.

5) Action: tightfisted object_11 object_5 object_8

Final state with respect to the goal
- Achieved goal predicates:
  - next(object_10, object_7) — added at step 13
  - next(object_11, object_7) — added at step 14
  - next(object_12, object_7) — added at step 15

Audit summary (consistency checks)
- Every action's preconditions were satisfied either by initial facts or by effects of earlier steps in this trace.
- No unsupported preconditions were encountered.
- Stage availability was used as a sequencing token: each action consumed its stage's availability and required the previous stage to be not-available, which enforces the exact ordering used above.
- No ad-hoc counters or hidden bookkeeping predicates were required beyond the explicit available/succ stage tokens present in the domain.

Timing note
- Each action is reported at the stage it consumed (stage_0 through stage_14). If you map stages to integer timestamps, you can view step N as occurring at timestamp stage_{N-1} (first action at stage_0, last at stage_14). Each action here is treated as occupying one stage token; duration per action = 1 stage (unit).

This sequence matches the provided plan exactly, preserves the action order and grounded arguments, and shows the causal preconditions/effects that produce the three goal next(...) predicates.
