Below is a clear, step-by-step, human-readable trace of the provided plan. Each step matches the plan exactly, reports the stage (timestamp) transition, assumes each action takes one discrete time step (stage_n -> stage_n+1), and states the immediate effect on package/vehicle locations.

1) [stage_0 -> stage_1] plane-load airplane_0 loads package_3 at location_0_0.
   - Preconditions met: airplane_0 and package_3 are co-located at location_0_0.
   - Effect: package_3 is now in airplane_0 (no longer at location_0_0).

2) [stage_1 -> stage_2] truck-load truck_1 loads package_0 at location_1_1.
   - Preconditions: truck_1 and package_0 co-located at location_1_1.
   - Effect: package_0 is now in truck_1 (no longer at location_1_1).

3) [stage_2 -> stage_3] truck-load truck_1 loads package_2 at location_1_1.
   - Preconditions: truck_1 and package_2 co-located at location_1_1.
   - Effect: package_2 is now in truck_1 (no longer at location_1_1).

4) [stage_3 -> stage_4] plane-fly airplane_0 flies from location_0_0 to location_1_0 (city_0 -> city_1).
   - Preconditions: airplane_0 at location_0_0 (an airport) and location_1_0 is an airport in another city.
   - Effect: airplane_0 is now at location_1_0, carrying package_3.

5) [stage_4 -> stage_5] plane-unload airplane_0 unloads package_3 at location_1_0.

10) [stage_9 -> stage_10] truck-load truck_1 loads package_1 at location_1_0.
    - Preconditions: truck_1 at location_1_0 and package_1 at location_1_0.
    - Effect: package_1 is now in truck_1 (no longer at location_1_0).

11) [stage_10 -> stage_11] truck-unload truck_1 unloads package_2 at location_1_0.
    - Preconditions: truck_1 at location_1_0 and package_2 in truck_1.
    - Effect: package_2 is now at location_1_0 (no longer in truck_1).

12) [stage_11 -> stage_12] plane-load airplane_0 loads package_2 at location_1_0.
    - Preconditions: airplane_0 at location_1_0 and package_2 at location_1_0.
    - Effect: package_2 is now in airplane_0 (no longer at location_1_0). (airplane_0 currently also carries package_0)

13) [stage_12 -> stage_13] plane-fly airplane_0 flies from location_1_0 to location_0_0 (city_1 -> city_0).
    - Preconditions: airplane_0 at location_1_0 (airport) and location_0_0 is an airport in a different city.
    - Effect: airplane_0 is now at location_0_0 carrying package_0 and package_2.

14) [stage_13 -> stage_14] plane-unload airplane_0 unloads package_0 at location_0_0.
    - Preconditions: airplane_0 at location_0_0 and package_0 in airplane_0.
    - Effect: package_0 is now at location_0_0 (no longer in airplane_0).

15) [stage_14 -> stage_15] plane-unload airplane_0 unloads package_2 at location_0_0.
    - Preconditions: airplane_0 at location_0_0 and package_2 in airplane_0.
    - Effect: package_2 is now at location_0_0 (no longer in airplane_0).

16) [stage_15 -> stage_16] truck-load truck_0 loads package_2 at location_0_0.
    - Preconditions: truck_0 at location_0_0 and package_2 at location_0_0.
    - Effect: package_2 is now in truck_0 (no longer at location_0_0).

17) [stage_16 -> stage_17] truck-drive truck_0 drives from location_0_0 to location_0_1 (within city_0).
    - Preconditions: truck_0 at location_0_0 and both locations in same city.
    - Effect: truck_0 is now at location_0_1, carrying package_2.

18) [stage_17 -> stage_18] truck-unload truck_0 unloads package_2 at location_0_1.
    - Preconditions: truck_0 at location_0_1 and package_2 in truck_0.
    - Effect: package_2 is now at location_0_1 (no longer in truck_0).

19) [stage_18 -> stage_19] truck-load truck_1 loads package_3 at location_1_0.
    - Preconditions: truck_1 at location_1_0 and package_3 at location_1_0.
    - Effect: package_3 is now in truck_1 (no longer at location_1_0).

20) [stage_19 -> stage_20] truck-drive truck_1 drives from location_1_0 to location_1_1 (within city_1).
    - Preconditions: truck_1 at location_1_0 and both locations in same city.
    - Effect: truck_1 is now at location_1_1, carrying package_1 and package_3.

21) [stage_20 -> stage_21] truck-unload truck_1 unloads package_1 at location_1_1.
    - Preconditions: truck_1 at location_1_1 and package_1 in truck_1.
    - Effect: package_1 is now at location_1_1 (no longer in truck_1).

22) [stage_21 -> stage_22] truck-unload truck_1 unloads package_3 at location_1_1.
    - Preconditions: truck_1 at location_1_1 and package_3 in truck_1.
    - Effect: package_3 is now at location_1_1 (no longer in truck_1).

Final state (after stage_22) — verifies the goal:
- package_0 is at location_0_0
- package_1 is at location_1_1
- package_2 is at location_0_1
- package_3 is at location_1_1

All actions, timestamps, and effects above correspond exactly to the given plan (each action consumes one stage step). The final package locations match the specified goal.
