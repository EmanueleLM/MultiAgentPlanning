Below is a step-by-step, human-readable execution trace of the provided plan. Each step shows: a timestamp (one time unit per action), the action and its parameters, the action's explicit preconditions (from the domain templates), whether those preconditions hold at that moment, the action's effects (added and deleted facts), and the updated set of important facts that are changed by the domain (I track the evolving next/ vase facts because the goal concerns next relations). All preconditions hold at every step (the given plan is valid). Time begins at t = 1 and advances by 1 per action.

Initial relevant facts (before t=1)

- cats: {0}
- texture: {5,6,7,8}
- spring: {5,7}
- stupendous: {1,2}
- collect: {(5,1),(6,1),(7,2),(8,2)}

Final check against the stated goal (from the problem):
- Required: (next object_10 object_6) — present (added step 18)
- Required: (next object_11 object_7) — present (added step 22)
- Required: (next object_12 object_7) — present (added step 21)
- Required: (next object_9 object_6) — present (added step 17)

Conclusion: All goal next-relations are achieved at the end of the plan execution. Every action's preconditions held when the action was applied, and effects have been applied as shown. The timeline above matches the given plan exactly (22 actions, same parameters and order) and demonstrates deterministically how the initial next relations were transformed to reach the goal next relations.

If you want, I can:
- produce a compact summary timeline showing only the changes to next (and the time they occurred),
- or produce the same trace but grouped by the predicates (e.g., when each next pair was created/removed),
- or export this trace as a table or CSV with timestamps.
