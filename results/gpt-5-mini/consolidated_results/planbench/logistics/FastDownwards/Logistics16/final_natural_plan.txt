Below is a step-by-step, human-readable trace of the provided plan. Each step consumes exactly one stage (duration = 1 stage unit), advancing the current stage from the listed start stage to the listed successor stage. For each action I list the action name, the parameter objects (in the same order as the plan), the starting and resulting stage, and the primary effects (facts added and facts deleted) according to the domain.

Final state (after step 40, current_stage = stage_40):
- The goal next-relations required by the problem are satisfied:
  (next object_10 object_8) — established at step 39
  (next object_11 object_6) — established at step 37
  (next object_12 object_8) — established at step 40
  (next object_9 object_5) — established at step 34
- current_stage is advanced to stage_40 (the plan consumed 40 stage units)

Summary: The supplied plan executes 40 actions, each consuming one stage, and produces the required goal facts at stage_40.
