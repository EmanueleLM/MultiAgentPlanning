   - Preconditions (met): package_2 at location_1_0, airplane_0 at location_1_0, location_1_0 is an airport, package_2 free.
   - Effects: package_2 is removed from location_1_0 and placed inside airplane_0; package_2 becomes not free; current stage becomes stage_5.

6) Step 6 — fly(airplane_0, location_1_0 → location_0_0)
   - Time: stage_5 → stage_6 (duration: 1 stage unit)
   - Description: airplane_0 flies from airport location_1_0 (city_1) to airport location_0_0 (city_0).
   - Preconditions (met): airplane_0 at location_1_0; both source and destination are airports.
   - Effects: airplane_0 is now at location_0_0; current stage becomes stage_6. Packages inside airplane_0 (package_2) move with the airplane.

7) Step 7 — unload-plane(package_2, airplane_0, location_0_0)
   - Time: stage_6 → stage_7 (duration: 1 stage unit)
   - Description: package_2 is unloaded from airplane_0 at airport location_0_0.
   - Preconditions (met): package_2 in airplane_0, airplane_0 at location_0_0, location_0_0 is an airport.
   - Effects: package_2 is removed from airplane_0 and placed at location_0_0; package_2 becomes free; current stage becomes stage_7.

8) Step 8 — drive-truck(truck_0, location_0_1 → location_0_0, city_0)
   - Time: stage_7 → stage_8 (duration: 1 stage unit)
   - Description: truck_0 drives from location_0_1 to location_0_0 within city_0.
   - Preconditions (met): truck_0 at location_0_1; both locations are in city_0.
   - Effects: truck_0 is now at location_0_0; current stage becomes stage_8. Note: package_0 remains inside truck_0 from Step 1 and travels with the truck.

9) Step 9 — load-truck(package_2, truck_0, location_0_0)
   - Time: stage_8 → stage_9 (duration: 1 stage unit)
   - Description: package_2 (just unloaded from the plane at location_0_0) is loaded into truck_0 at location_0_0.
   - Preconditions (met): package_2 at location_0_0, truck_0 at location_0_0, package_2 free.
   - Effects: package_2 is removed from location_0_0 and placed inside truck_0; package_2 becomes not free; current stage becomes stage_9.
   - State: truck_0 now contains package_0 and package_2.

10) Step 10 — unload-truck(package_0, truck_0, location_0_0)
    - Time: stage_9 → stage_10 (duration: 1 stage unit)
    - Description: package_0 is unloaded from truck_0 at location_0_0 (the airport in city_0).
    - Preconditions (met): package_0 in truck_0, truck_0 at location_0_0.
    - Effects: package_0 is removed from truck_0 and placed at location_0_0; package_0 becomes free; current stage becomes stage_10.
    - Goal achieved (package_0): package_0 is now at location_0_0 (goal satisfied).

11) Step 11 — drive-truck(truck_0, location_0_0 → location_0_1, city_0)
    - Time: stage_10 → stage_11 (duration: 1 stage unit)
    - Description: truck_0 drives from location_0_0 back to location_0_1 within city_0.
    - Preconditions (met): truck_0 at location_0_0; both locations are in city_0.
    - Effects: truck_0 is now at location_0_1; current stage becomes stage_11. package_2 remains inside truck_0.

12) Step 12 — unload-truck(package_2, truck_0, location_0_1)
    - Time: stage_11 → stage_12 (duration: 1 stage unit)
    - Description: package_2 is unloaded from truck_0 at location_0_1.
    - Preconditions (met): package_2 in truck_0, truck_0 at location_0_1.
    - Effects: package_2 is removed from truck_0 and placed at location_0_1; package_2 becomes free; current stage becomes stage_12.
    - Goal achieved (package_2): package_2 is now at location_0_1 (goal satisfied).

Final state and goal verification:
 - package_0: at location_0_0 (achieved at Step 10)
 - package_1: at location_1_0 (achieved at Step 4)
 - package_2: at location_0_1 (achieved at Step 12)
 - package_3: at location_1_1 (never moved; initial position matches goal)
Total actions executed: 12. Total cost (unit per action): 12.
