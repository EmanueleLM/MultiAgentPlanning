Below is a clear, step-by-step human-readable execution of the provided plan. Each step corresponds exactly to one action in the plan, lists the time transition (stage timestamp), enumerates the preconditions checked (using the domain predicates), and lists the deterministic effects (facts added and removed). Each action is assumed to consume the single discrete time step from stage_i to stage_{i+1} as shown.

Summary: total actions = 12, total cost = 12 (unit cost per action). Final time = stage_12.

Step 1 — Time: stage_0 → stage_1
Action: sip(object_12, object_0, object_8)
- Preconditions checked:
  - (hand object_12)
  - (cats object_0)
  - (texture object_8)
  - (next object_12 object_8)
  - (next object_0 object_8)
  - (current stage_0) and (time-next stage_0 stage_1)
- Effects (applied):
  - Added: (vase object_12 object_0)
  - Removed: (next object_12 object_8)
  - Time advance: (current stage_0) removed, (current stage_1) added

Plain English: Using hand object_12 and cats object_0 on texture object_8, create vase(object_12,object_0), consume the (next object_12 object_8) relation, and advance time to stage_1.

Step 2 — Time: stage_1 → stage_2
Action: memory(object_0, object_8, object_6)
- Preconditions checked:
  - (cats object_0)
  - (spring object_8)
  - (spring object_6)
  - (next object_0 object_8)
  - (current stage_1) and (time-next stage_1 stage_2)
- Effects (applied):
  - Added: (next object_0 object_6)
  - Removed: (next object_0 object_8)
  - Time advance to stage_2

Plain English: For cats object_0, switch its "next" target from object_8 to object_6 (object_0 now points to object_6), and advance time to stage_2.

Step 3 — Time: stage_2 → stage_3
Action: paltry(object_12, object_0, object_6)
- Preconditions checked:
  - (hand object_12)
  - (cats object_0)
  - (texture object_6)
  - (vase object_12 object_0)   (created in Step 1)
  - (next object_0 object_6)   (created in Step 2)
  - (current stage_2) and (time-next stage_2 stage_3)
- Effects (applied):
  - Added: (next object_12 object_6)
  - Removed: (vase object_12 object_0)
  - Time advance to stage_3

Plain English: Move the "next" association so that object_12 points to object_6 (and remove the prior vase relation object_12–object_0), then advance to stage_3.

Step 4 — Time: stage_3 → stage_4
Action: clip(object_10, object_4, object_7)
- Preconditions checked:
  - (hand object_10)
  - (sneeze object_4)
  - (texture object_7)
  - (next object_4 object_7)
  - (next object_10 object_7)
  - (current stage_3) and (time-next stage_3 stage_4)
- Effects (applied):
  - Added: (vase object_10 object_4)
  - Removed: (next object_10 object_7)
  - Time advance to stage_4

Plain English: With hand object_10 and sneeze object_4 over texture object_7, create vase(object_10,object_4), remove object_10's old next relation to object_7, and advance to stage_4.

Step 5 — Time: stage_4 → stage_5
Action: clip(object_11, object_5, object_9)
- Preconditions checked:
  - (hand object_11)
  - (sneeze object_5)
  - (texture object_9)
  - (next object_5 object_9)
  - (next object_11 object_9)
  - (current stage_4) and (time-next stage_4 stage_5)
- Effects (applied):
  - Added: (vase object_11 object_5)
  - Removed: (next object_11 object_9)
  - Time advance to stage_5

Plain English: Form vase(object_11,object_5), remove object_11's next->object_9 relation, then advance to stage_5.

Step 6 — Time: stage_5 → stage_6
Action: wretched(object_5, object_9, object_8, object_3)
- Preconditions checked:
  - (sneeze object_5)
  - (texture object_9)
  - (texture object_8)
  - (stupendous object_3)
  - (next object_5 object_9)

  - (collect object_8 object_3)
  - (current stage_5) and (time-next stage_5 stage_6)
- Effects (applied):
  - Added: (next object_5 object_8)
  - Removed: (next object_5 object_9)
  - Time advance to stage_6

Plain English: For sneeze object_5, change its next-pointer from object_9 to object_8 (supported by collect relations to object_3), and advance to stage_6.

Step 7 — Time: stage_6 → stage_7
Action: tightfisted(object_11, object_5, object_8)
- Preconditions checked:
  - (hand object_11)
  - (sneeze object_5)

  - (current stage_6) and (time-next stage_6 stage_7)
- Effects (applied):
  - Added: (next object_11 object_8)
  - Removed: (vase object_11 object_5)
  - Time advance to stage_7

Plain English: Use vase(object_11,object_5) together with the sneeze/object_5->object_8 relation to give object_11 a new next->object_8, remove the vase, and advance to stage_7.

Step 8 — Time: stage_7 → stage_8
Action: wretched(object_4, object_7, object_6, object_2)
- Preconditions checked:

- Effects (applied):
  - Added: (next object_4 object_6)
  - Removed: (next object_4 object_7)
  - Time advance to stage_8

Plain English: For sneeze object_4, switch its next from object_7 to object_6 (backed by collects to object_2), then advance to stage_8.

Step 9 — Time: stage_8 → stage_9
Action: tightfisted(object_10, object_4, object_6)
- Preconditions checked:
  - (hand object_10)
  - (sneeze object_4)

- Effects (applied):
  - Added: (next object_10 object_6)
  - Removed: (vase object_10 object_4)
  - Time advance to stage_9

Plain English: Give object_10 the next->object_6 relation (using vase object_10–object_4 and object_4->object_6), remove the vase, advance to stage_9.

Step 10 — Time: stage_9 → stage_10
Action: clip(object_12, object_4, object_6)
- Preconditions checked:
  - (hand object_12)

  - Removed: (next object_12 object_6)
  - Time advance to stage_10

Plain English: Form vase(object_12,object_4) by combining object_12 and object_4 over texture object_6, remove object_12's next->object_6 relation, and advance to stage_10.

Step 11 — Time: stage_10 → stage_11
Action: wretched(object_4, object_6, object_7, object_2)
- Preconditions checked:
  - (sneeze object_4)
  - (texture object_6)
  - (texture object_7)
  - (stupendous object_2)

  - (collect object_6 object_2)
  - (collect object_7 object_2)
  - (current stage_10) and (time-next stage_10 stage_11)
- Effects (applied):
  - Added: (next object_4 object_7)
  - Removed: (next object_4 object_6)
  - Time advance to stage_11

Plain English: Change object_4's next pointer back from object_6 to object_7 (using collect relations), and advance to stage_11.

Step 12 — Time: stage_11 → stage_12
Action: tightfisted(object_12, object_4, object_7)
- Preconditions checked:
  - (hand object_12)
  - (sneeze object_4)
  - (texture object_7)
  - (next object_4 object_7)     (created in Step 11)
  - (vase object_12 object_4)     (created in Step 10)
  - (current stage_11) and (time-next stage_11 stage_12)
- Effects (applied):
  - Added: (next object_12 object_7)
  - Removed: (vase object_12 object_4)
  - Time advance to stage_12

Plain English: Use vase(object_12,object_4) and the new object_4->object_7 relation to give object_12 a next->object_7, remove the vase, and advance to the final time stage_12.

Final status (after Step 12, current stage = stage_12)
- The plan achieves the specified goal facts:
  - (next object_10 object_6)  — created in Step 9
  - (next object_11 object_8)  — created in Step 7
  - (next object_12 object_7)  — created in Step 12
  - (next object_13 object_9)  — was already present in the initial state and never removed
- Current time: (current stage_12)
- Total actions executed: 12
- Total cost: 12 (unit cost per action)

No actions were added or removed from the given plan. Each step above reports the exact time transition (stage_i → stage_{i+1}), the concrete preconditions verified, and the deterministic effects applied, matching the domain specification.
