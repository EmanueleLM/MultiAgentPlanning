Plan (step-by-step, sequential timestamps; each action duration = 1 time unit; total cost = 11):

1) t=0 → t=1 — drive-truck truck_0 from location_0_2 to location_0_1 (city_0).
   - Preconditions satisfied: truck_0 at location_0_2; both locations in city_0; truck_0 is truck_of_city city_0.
   - Effect: truck_0 now at location_0_1.

2) t=1 → t=2 — load-truck truck_0 package_0 at location_0_1.
   - Preconditions satisfied: truck_0 at location_0_1; package_0 at location_0_1.
   - Effect: package_0 is in-truck truck_0; package_0 no longer at location_0_1.

3) t=2 → t=3 — drive-truck truck_0 from location_0_1 to location_0_0 (city_0).
   - Preconditions satisfied: truck_0 at location_0_1; both locations in city_0.
   - Effect: truck_0 now at location_0_0. (package_0 remains in-truck truck_0)

4) t=3 → t=4 — unload-truck truck_0 package_0 at location_0_0.
   - Preconditions satisfied: truck_0 at location_0_0; package_0 in-truck truck_0.
   - Effect: package_0 now at location_0_0; package_0 no longer in truck_0.

5) t=4 → t=5 — fly-airplane airplane_0 from location_1_0 to location_0_0.
   - Preconditions satisfied: airplane_0 at location_1_0; both locations are airports.
   - Effect: airplane_0 now at location_0_0.

6) t=5 → t=6 — load-airplane airplane_0 package_0 at location_0_0.
   - Preconditions satisfied: airplane_0 at location_0_0; package_0 at location_0_0; location_0_0 is an airport.
   - Effect: package_0 is in-airplane airplane_0; package_0 no longer at location_0_0.

7) t=6 → t=7 — fly-airplane airplane_0 from location_0_0 to location_1_0.
   - Preconditions satisfied: airplane_0 at location_0_0; both locations are airports.
   - Effect: airplane_0 now at location_1_0. (package_0 remains in-airplane airplane_0)

8) t=7 → t=8 — unload-airplane airplane_0 package_0 at location_1_0.
   - Preconditions satisfied: airplane_0 at location_1_0; package_0 in-airplane airplane_0; location_1_0 is an airport.
   - Effect: package_0 now at location_1_0; package_0 no longer in airplane_0.

9) t=8 → t=9 — load-truck truck_1 package_0 at location_1_0.
   - Preconditions satisfied: truck_1 at location_1_0; package_0 at location_1_0.
   - Effect: package_0 is in-truck truck_1; package_0 no longer at location_1_0.

10) t=9 → t=10 — drive-truck truck_1 from location_1_0 to location_1_2 (city_1).
    - Preconditions satisfied: truck_1 at location_1_0; both locations in city_1; truck_1 is truck_of_city city_1.
    - Effect: truck_1 now at location_1_2. (package_0 remains in-truck truck_1)

11) t=10 → t=11 — unload-truck truck_1 package_0 at location_1_2.
    - Preconditions satisfied: truck_1 at location_1_2; package_0 in-truck truck_1.
    - Effect: package_0 now at location_1_2; package_0 no longer in truck_1.

Goal achieved: at t=11 package_0 is at location_1_2. Total plan cost = 11 (1 per action).
