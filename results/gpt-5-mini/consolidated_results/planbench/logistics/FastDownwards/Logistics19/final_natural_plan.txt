Below is a concise, human-readable execution trace that follows the provided plan exactly. Each step shows the action, its parameters, the stage transition (used as a timestamp), the required preconditions (as checked at that time), the effects applied, and the resulting key facts. Each action advances the global stage by one; for readability I record time t = stage index (stage_0 = t0). Assume each action takes 1 time unit.

1) t0 → t1 (stage_0 → stage_1), duration 1
   Action: memory(object_0, object_8, object_5)
   Preconditions (checked at t0): cats(object_0), spring(object_8), spring(object_5), next(object_0, object_8)
   Effects applied: add next(object_0, object_5); delete next(object_0, object_8)
   Key result after t1: next(object_0, object_5) (replaced previous next(object_0, object_8))

2) t1 → t2 (stage_1 → stage_2), duration 1
   Action: wretched(object_3, object_7, object_6, object_1)
   Preconditions (checked at t1): sneeze(object_3), texture(object_7), texture(object_6), stupendous(object_1), next(object_3, object_7), collect(object_7, object_1), collect(object_6, object_1)
   Effects applied: add next(object_3, object_6); delete next(object_3, object_7)
   Key result after t2: next(object_3, object_6)

3) t2 → t3 (stage_2 → t3), duration 1
   Action: clip(object_11, object_3, object_6)
   Preconditions (checked at t2): hand(object_11), sneeze(object_3), texture(object_6), next(object_3, object_6), next(object_11, object_6)
   Effects applied: add vase(object_11, object_3); delete next(object_11, object_6)
   Key result after t3: vase(object_11, object_3) (object_11 no longer has next to object_6)

4) t3 → t4 (stage_3 → stage_4), duration 1
   Action: wretched(object_3, object_6, object_5, object_1)
   Preconditions (checked at t3): sneeze(object_3), texture(object_6), texture(object_5), stupendous(object_1), next(object_3, object_6), collect(object_6, object_1), collect(object_5, object_1)
   Effects applied: add next(object_3, object_5); delete next(object_3, object_6)
   Key result after t4: next(object_3, object_5)

5) t4 → t5 (stage_4 → stage_5), duration 1
   Action: tightfisted(object_11, object_3, object_5)
   Preconditions (checked at t4): hand(object_11), sneeze(object_3), texture(object_5), next(object_3, object_5), vase(object_11, object_3)
   Effects applied: add next(object_11, object_5); delete vase(object_11, object_3)
   Key result after t5: next(object_11, object_5) (vase between 11 and 3 removed)

6) t5 → t6 (stage_5 → stage_6), duration 1
   Action: sip(object_11, object_0, object_5)
   Preconditions (checked at t5): hand(object_11), cats(object_0), texture(object_5), next(object_11, object_5), next(object_0, object_5)
   Effects applied: add vase(object_11, object_0); delete next(object_11, object_5)
   Key result after t6: vase(object_11, object_0) (object_11 no longer has next to object_5)

7) t6 → t7 (stage_6 → stage_7), duration 1
   Action: memory(object_0, object_5, object_8)
   Preconditions (checked at t6): cats(object_0), spring(object_5), spring(object_8), next(object_0, object_5)
   Effects applied: add next(object_0, object_8); delete next(object_0, object_5)
   Key result after t7: next(object_0, object_8) (restored)

8) t7 → t8 (stage_7 → stage_8), duration 1
   Action: paltry(object_11, object_0, object_8)
   Preconditions (checked at t7): hand(object_11), cats(object_0), texture(object_8), vase(object_11, object_0), next(object_0, object_8)
   Effects applied: add next(object_11, object_8); delete vase(object_11, object_0)
   Key result after t8: next(object_11, object_8) (vase between 11 and 0 removed)

9) t8 → t9 (stage_8 → stage_9), duration 1
   Action: clip(object_11, object_4, object_8)
   Preconditions (checked at t8): hand(object_11), sneeze(object_4), texture(object_8), next(object_4, object_8), next(object_11, object_8)
   Effects applied: add vase(object_11, object_4); delete next(object_11, object_8)
   Key result after t9: vase(object_11, object_4)

10) t9 → t10 (stage_9 → stage_10), duration 1
    Action: wretched(object_4, object_8, object_10, object_2)
    Preconditions (checked at t9): sneeze(object_4), texture(object_8), texture(object_10), stupendous(object_2), next(object_4, object_8), collect(object_8, object_2), collect(object_10, object_2)
    Effects applied: add next(object_4, object_10); delete next(object_4, object_8)
    Key result after t10: next(object_4, object_10)

11) t10 → t11 (stage_10 → stage_11), duration 1
    Action: tightfisted(object_11, object_4, object_10)
    Preconditions (checked at t10): hand(object_11), sneeze(object_4), texture(object_10), next(object_4, object_10), vase(object_11, object_4)
    Effects applied: add next(object_11, object_10); delete vase(object_11, object_4)
    Key result after t11: next(object_11, object_10)

Final state and goal check (after t11 / stage_11):
- Achieved goal predicate: next(object_11, object_10) — present.
- Current stage: stage_11 — present (the plan advanced current-stage from stage_0 to stage_11 through the 11 actions).
- Both parts of the scenario goal are satisfied.

Notes:
- Every action’s preconditions were satisfied when the action executed, and each action advanced the global stage by one (enforcing contiguous progression).
- The plan follows the given action sequence exactly and reaches the stated final goal at t11.
