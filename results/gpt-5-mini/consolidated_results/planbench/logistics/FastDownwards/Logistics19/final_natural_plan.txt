Plan summary — human-readable execution trace (timestamps in integer time-units; each action advances the stage by one):

Initial state (time 0):
- truck_1 at location_1_2
- truck_0 at location_0_0
- airplane_0 at location_0_0
- package_0 at location_1_0
- location_1_0 is an airport for city_1
- current stage = stage_0

1) Time 0 → 1
Action: truck_agent drives truck_1 from location_1_2 to location_1_0
- Preconditions checked: truck_1 is at location_1_2; location_1_2 and location_1_0 are in the same city (city_1); current_stage = stage_0 and succ(stage_0, stage_1) holds.
- Effects applied: truck_1 is now at location_1_0; truck_1 is no longer at location_1_2; current_stage becomes stage_1.
- State after action: truck_1 at location_1_0; package_0 still at location_1_0 (waiting at the airport).

2) Time 1 → 2
Action: truck_agent loads package_0 into truck_1 at location_1_0
- Preconditions checked: truck_1 is at location_1_0; package_0 is at location_1_0; current_stage = stage_1 and succ(stage_1, stage_2) holds.
- Effects applied: package_0 is now in_truck truck_1; package_0 is no longer recorded at location_1_0; current_stage becomes stage_2.
- State after action: package_0 carried inside truck_1 at location_1_0.

3) Time 2 → 3
Action: truck_agent drives truck_1 from location_1_0 to location_1_1
- Preconditions checked: truck_1 is at location_1_0; location_1_0 and location_1_1 are in the same city (city_1); current_stage = stage_2 and succ(stage_2, stage_3) holds.
- Effects applied: truck_1 is now at location_1_1; truck_1 is no longer at location_1_0; current_stage becomes stage_3.
- State after action: truck_1 at location_1_1 carrying package_0.

4) Time 3 → 4
Action: truck_agent unloads package_0 from truck_1 at location_1_1
- Preconditions checked: truck_1 is at location_1_1; package_0 is in_truck truck_1; current_stage = stage_3 and succ(stage_3, stage_4) holds.
- Effects applied: package_0 is now at location_1_1; package_0 is no longer in_truck truck_1; current_stage becomes stage_4.
- State after action: package_0 at location_1_1.

Goal achieved at time 4: package_0 is at location_1_1.

Plan cost: 4 (one per action). Total elapsed time (using 1 time-unit per action as staged): 4 time-units.

Notes on compliance with the specification:
- All truck moves stayed within city_1 (truck-only intra-city movement).
- Loading/unloading occurred only when truck and package were co-located.
- The staged timestamps correspond to the staged precondition/successor bookkeeping used in the model (stage_0→stage_1→stage_2→stage_3→stage_4).
