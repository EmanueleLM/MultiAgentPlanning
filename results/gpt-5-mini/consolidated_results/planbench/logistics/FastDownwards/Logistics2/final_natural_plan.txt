Summary: Execute the five planned actions in sequence. Each action advances the discrete stage by one step (stage_0 → stage_1 → ... → stage_5). Actions are atomic and executed one after another. For concreteness I assign each action a duration of 1 time unit and list start/end timestamps (these timestamps are illustrative and consistent with the stage ordering).

Initial state (before step 1):
- airplane_0 at location_1_0 (an airport in city_1)
- package_0 at location_1_0
- package_1 at location_1_0
- goal: both packages at location_0_0; current stage = stage_0

Plan steps:

1) airplane_load package_0 airplane_0 location_1_0 stage_0 → stage_1
- Action: Load package_0 into airplane_0 at location_1_0.
- Start time: t = 0. End time: t = 1.
- Preconditions satisfied: airplane_0 is at location_1_0; package_0 is at location_1_0; location_1_0 is an airport; current-stage = stage_0 and stage_succ(stage_0, stage_1) holds.
- Effects: package_0 is no longer at location_1_0; package_0 is now in airplane_0; current-stage becomes stage_1.

2) airplane_load package_1 airplane_0 location_1_0 stage_1 → stage_2
- Action: Load package_1 into airplane_0 at location_1_0.
- Start time: t = 1. End time: t = 2.
- Preconditions satisfied: airplane_0 is at location_1_0; package_1 is at location_1_0; location_1_0 is an airport; current-stage = stage_1 and stage_succ(stage_1, stage_2) holds.
- Effects: package_1 is no longer at location_1_0; package_1 is now in airplane_0; current-stage becomes stage_2.

3) airplane_fly airplane_0 location_1_0 location_0_0 city_1 city_0 stage_2 → stage_3
- Action: Fly airplane_0 from location_1_0 (airport in city_1) to location_0_0 (airport in city_0).
- Start time: t = 2. End time: t = 3.
- Preconditions satisfied: airplane_0 is at location_1_0; both from and to are airports; location_in_city(location_1_0, city_1) and location_in_city(location_0_0, city_0); current-stage = stage_2 and stage_succ(stage_2, stage_3) holds. (The flight is inter-city: destination is not in the same city as source.)
- Effects: airplane_0 is no longer at location_1_0 and is now at location_0_0; current-stage becomes stage_3. Both package_0 and package_1 remain in airplane_0 during flight.

4) airplane_unload package_0 airplane_0 location_0_0 stage_3 → stage_4
- Action: Unload package_0 from airplane_0 at location_0_0.
- Start time: t = 3. End time: t = 4.
- Preconditions satisfied: package_0 is in airplane_0; airplane_0 is at location_0_0; location_0_0 is an airport; current-stage = stage_3 and stage_succ(stage_3, stage_4) holds.
- Effects: package_0 is removed from airplane_0 and placed at location_0_0; current-stage becomes stage_4.

5) airplane_unload package_1 airplane_0 location_0_0 stage_4 → stage_5
- Action: Unload package_1 from airplane_0 at location_0_0.
- Start time: t = 4. End time: t = 5.
- Preconditions satisfied: package_1 is in airplane_0; airplane_0 is at location_0_0; location_0_0 is an airport; current-stage = stage_4 and stage_succ(stage_4, stage_5) holds.
- Effects: package_1 is removed from airplane_0 and placed at location_0_0; current-stage becomes stage_5.

Final state (after step 5, t = 5):
- package_0 at location_0_0
- package_1 at location_0_0
- current-stage = stage_5
- Goal achieved.

Notes on compliance:
- Every action matches the given plan exactly (same action names and parameters, and same stage transitions).
- Each step lists preconditions and effects that align with the domain model (loads/unloads require same location and airport condition for airplanes; flight is inter-city).
- Actions are sequenced to respect the discrete stage progression demanded by the model (no simultaneous actions).
