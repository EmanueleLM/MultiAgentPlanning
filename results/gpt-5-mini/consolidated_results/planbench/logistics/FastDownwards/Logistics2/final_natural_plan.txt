Summary: No actions are required. The provided plan is empty (cost = 0) and the goal is already satisfied in the initial state.

Details:
- Plan length: 0 actions (cost = 0).
- Time / timestamp: no actions executed, so time remains at the initial stage (now = stage_0). No duration elapses.
- Initial / final relevant fluents (unchanged):
  - (next object_7 object_6) — present initially and still true.
  - (next object_8 object_6) — present initially and still true.
- Other facts and predicates remain as in the problem's (:init) section; no add/delete effects occur because no actions ran.

Conclusion: The empty plan is valid: the goal (next object_7 object_6 AND next object_8 object_6) holds already in the initial state, so no steps are needed.
