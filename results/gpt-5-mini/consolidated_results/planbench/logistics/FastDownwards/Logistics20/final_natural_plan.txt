Execution trace (human-readable), following the plan exactly and showing time stages:

Initial relevant facts:
- package_0 is at location_1_1.
- truck_1 is at location_1_0.
- Both location_1_0, location_1_1, location_1_2 are in city_1.
- current-stage = time_0.

Step 1 — Drive truck_1 from location_1_0 to location_1_1
- Action: truck-drive truck_1 location_1_0 → location_1_1
- Agent/vehicle: truck_1 (operates within city_1)
- Time: time_0 → time_1
- Preconditions satisfied: truck_1 is at location_1_0; location_1_0 and location_1_1 are in the same city (city_1); current-stage is time_0.
- Effects: truck_1 is no longer at location_1_0 and is now at location_1_1; current-stage advances to time_1.
- Package state after action: package_0 remains at location_1_1.

Step 2 — Load package_0 into truck_1 at location_1_1
- Action: truck-load truck_1 package_0 at location_1_1
- Agent/vehicle: truck_1
- Time: time_1 → time_2
- Preconditions satisfied: truck_1 is at location_1_1; package_0 is at location_1_1; current-stage is time_1.
- Effects: package_0 is removed from location_1_1 and becomes in-truck truck_1; current-stage advances to time_2.

Step 3 — Drive truck_1 from location_1_1 to location_1_2
- Action: truck-drive truck_1 location_1_1 → location_1_2
- Agent/vehicle: truck_1
- Time: time_2 → time_3
- Preconditions satisfied: truck_1 is at location_1_1; location_1_1 and location_1_2 are in the same city (city_1); current-stage is time_2.
- Effects: truck_1 is no longer at location_1_1 and is now at location_1_2; package_0 remains inside truck_1; current-stage advances to time_3.

Step 4 — Unload package_0 from truck_1 at location_1_2
- Action: truck-unload truck_1 package_0 at location_1_2
- Agent/vehicle: truck_1
- Time: time_3 → time_4
- Preconditions satisfied: truck_1 is at location_1_2; package_0 is in-truck truck_1; current-stage is time_3.
- Effects: package_0 is removed from truck_1 and placed at location_1_2; current-stage advances to time_4.

Result / Goal achievement:
- After Step 4 (at time_4) package_0 is at location_1_2 — the goal (package_0 at location_1_2) is satisfied.
- Plan cost (as given): 4 (unit cost).
