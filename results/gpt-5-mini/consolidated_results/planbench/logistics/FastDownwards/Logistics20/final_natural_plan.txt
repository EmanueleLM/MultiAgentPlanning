Below is a clear, step-by-step, human-readable rendering of the provided PDDL plan. I report the timepoint as the stage pair given in each plan step (stageN -> stageN+1). Each step lists the action, the concrete parameters (with their roles), the required precondition(s) that are used by that step, and the main effect(s) produced. I assume each stage transition corresponds to one time unit (duration = 1 time unit).

1) Time: stage0 → stage1 (t = 0 → 1) — Action: wretched(sn=object_4, t1=object_10, t2=object_11, st=object_3)  
   - Preconditions used: sneeze(object_4); texture(object_10), texture(object_11); stupendous(object_3); next(object_4, object_10); collect(object_10, object_3); collect(object_11, object_3).  
   - Effects: add next(object_4, object_11); delete next(object_4, object_10).  
   - Intuition: object_4’s “next” link is switched from object_10 to object_11 (with the required collection/stupendous support).

2) Time: stage1 → stage2 (t = 1 → 2) — Action: wretched(sn=object_4, t1=object_7, t2=object_10, st=object_2)  
   - Preconditions used: sneeze(object_4); texture(object_7), texture(object_10); stupendous(object_2); next(object_4, object_7); collect(object_7, object_2); collect(object_10, object_2).  
   - Effects: add next(object_4, object_10); delete next(object_4, object_7).  
   - Intuition: object_4 gains a “next” link to object_10 (and its link to object_7 is removed). Note: object_4 still retains the next(object_4, object_11) created earlier, so object_4 may have multiple next links concurrently.

3) Time: stage2 → stage3 (t = 2 → 3) — Action: clip(h=object_12, sn=object_4, t=object_10)  
   - Preconditions used: hand(object_12); sneeze(object_4); texture(object_10); next(object_4, object_10); next(object_12, object_10).  
   - Effects: add vase(object_12, object_4); delete next(object_12, object_10).  
   - Intuition: object_12 forms a vase relation with object_4; object_12’s previous next-to-object_10 link is removed.

4) Time: stage3 → stage4 (t = 3 → 4) — Action: tightfisted(h=object_12, sn=object_4, t=object_11)  
   - Preconditions used: hand(object_12); sneeze(object_4); texture(object_11); next(object_4, object_11); vase(object_12, object_4).  
   - Effects: add next(object_12, object_11); delete vase(object_12, object_4).  
   - Intuition: object_12 acquires a next link to object_11, and the temporary vase(object_12, object_4) is removed.

5) Time: stage4 → stage5 (t = 4 → 5) — Action: wretched(sn=object_5, t1=object_9, t2=object_8, st=object_2)  
   - Preconditions used: sneeze(object_5); texture(object_9), texture(object_8); stupendous(object_2); next(object_5, object_9); collect(object_9, object_2); collect(object_8, object_2).  
   - Effects: add next(object_5, object_8); delete next(object_5, object_9).  
   - Intuition: object_5’s next link is switched from object_9 to object_8.

6) Time: stage5 → stage6 (t = 5 → 6) — Action: clip(h=object_11, sn=object_5, t=object_8)  
   - Preconditions used: hand(object_11); sneeze(object_5); texture(object_8); next(object_5, object_8); next(object_11, object_8).  
   - Effects: add vase(object_11, object_5); delete next(object_11, object_8).  
   - Intuition: object_11 forms a vase relation with object_5; object_11’s next-to-object_8 link is removed.

7) Time: stage6 → stage7 (t = 6 → 7) — Action: wretched(sn=object_5, t1=object_8, t2=object_9, st=object_2)  
   - Preconditions used: sneeze(object_5); texture(object_8), texture(object_9); stupendous(object_2); next(object_5, object_8); collect(object_8, object_2); collect(object_9, object_2).  
   - Effects: add next(object_5, object_9); delete next(object_5, object_8).  
   - Intuition: object_5’s next link is switched back from object_8 to object_9.

8) Time: stage7 → stage8 (t = 7 → 8) — Action: tightfisted(h=object_11, sn=object_5, t=object_9)  
   - Preconditions used: hand(object_11); sneeze(object_5); texture(object_9); next(object_5, object_9); vase(object_11, object_5).  
   - Effects: add next(object_11, object_9); delete vase(object_11, object_5).  
   - Intuition: object_11 acquires the next link to object_9; the temporary vase(object_11, object_5) is removed.

Final state summary (after stage8):
- next(object_11, object_9) has been added (step 8) — this satisfies the goal next object_11 object_9.  
- next(object_12, object_11) has been added earlier (step 4) — this satisfies the goal next object_12 object_11.  
- Both declared goals (next object_11 object_9) and (next object_12 object_11) are achieved by the end of stage8.

Notes on timing and bookkeeping:
- Each action occupies its listed stage transition (stageN → stageN+1). I treated each transition as one time unit.  
- Several objects temporarily held multiple next relations concurrently (e.g., object_4 had next to object_11 and object_10 at the same time between steps). The plan uses that permissive bookkeeping and then removes the unwanted links later; the sequence above follows the provided plan exactly.
