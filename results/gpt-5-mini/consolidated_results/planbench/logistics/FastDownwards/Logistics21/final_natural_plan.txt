Below is a clear, step-by-step, human-readable execution of the provided plan. Each step follows the exact action in the plan, lists the grounded arguments, verifies that the action's preconditions hold at that time, and reports the add/delete effects applied. I use a simple timeline with one time unit per action (t = 0, 1, 2, ...). Only the changed facts at each step are shown (the rest of the state remains as previously established).

Initial relevant facts (before t=0)
- hand: object_11, object_12
- cats: object_0
- texture: object_10, object_5, object_6, object_7, object_8, object_9
- sneeze: object_3, object_4
- spring: object_5, object_8
- stupendous: object_1, object_2
- collect: (object_10,object_2), (object_5,object_1), (object_6,object_1), (object_7,object_1), (object_8,object_2), (object_9,object_2)
- next: (object_0,object_5), (object_11,object_9), (object_12,object_10), (object_3,object_6), (object_4,object_8)

Final check (after t = 17.0)
- Goal requires:
  - next(object_11,object_7) — Present (added at t=17).
  - next(object_12,object_5) — Present (added at t=13).
- Both goal facts are true. The plan succeeds.

Notes
- Each step above strictly mirrors the corresponding action in the provided plan; no actions were added or removed.
- Each action's preconditions were true at its time of execution; their effects (adding/deleting next or vase facts) were applied immediately and used by subsequent actions.
- Timeline used: one unit per action for clarity (t = 0.0, 1.0, ..., 17.0).
