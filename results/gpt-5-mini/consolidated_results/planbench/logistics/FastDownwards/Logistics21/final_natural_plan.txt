Below is a step-by-step, human-readable trace of the provided plan. I map each stage to a discrete timestamp t = stage_index and assume each action takes 1 time unit (start t = stage_n, end t = stage_n+1). For each step I state the action, actor, parameters, start and end timestamps, the key preconditions that must hold, and the effects (how package/vehicle locations change).

- Time: start t=0 (stage_0) → end t=1 (stage_1), duration = 1
- Preconditions: airplane_0 is at location_0_0; location_0_0 and location_1_0 are airports; air connection exists between them
- Effects: airplane_0 is now at location_1_0 (no longer at location_0_0)

Step 2
- Action: truck-drive
- Actor: truck_0

- Time: start t=10 (stage_10) → end t=11 (stage_11), duration = 1
- Preconditions: airplane_0 is at location_1_0; package_1 is at location_1_0; location_1_0 is an airport
- Effects: package_1 is now inside airplane_0 (in-plane); package_1 is no longer at location_1_0

Step 12
- Action: plane-fly

Step 13

Step 14
- Action: plane-unload
- Actor: airplane_0
- Parameters: unload package_1 at location_0_0
- Time: start t=13 (stage_13) → end t=14 (stage_14), duration = 1

- Time: start t=14 (stage_14) → end t=15 (stage_15), duration = 1
- Preconditions: truck_0 is at location_0_0; package_0 is at location_0_0; location in city_0
- Effects: package_0 is now inside truck_0 (in-truck); package_0 is no longer at location_0_0

Step 16
- Action: truck-drive
- Actor: truck_0
- Parameters: from location_0_0 -> to location_0_2 (city_0)
- Time: start t=15 (stage_15) → end t=16 (stage_16), duration = 1

- Effects: truck_0 is now at location_0_2 (no longer at location_0_0)

Step 17
- Action: truck-unload
- Actor: truck_0
- Parameters: unload package_0 at location_0_2 (city_0)
- Time: start t=16 (stage_16) → end t=17 (stage_17), duration = 1
- Preconditions: truck_0 is at location_0_2; package_0 is inside truck_0; location in city_0

Final state (after t=17)
- package_0 is at location_0_2 (goal achieved)
- package_1 is at location_0_0 (goal achieved)
- airplane_0 is at location_0_0
- truck_0 is at location_0_2
- truck_1 is at location_1_0

Notes on timing and consistency
- Each plan step corresponds exactly to one stage transition stage_n → stage_n+1, so I reported start = n and end = n+1.
- All load/unload actions occur only where allowed (truck loads/unloads at locations within its city; plane loads/unloads at airport locations).
- The plane moves only between airports and the trucks only drive within their cities, matching the domain constraints.
- No actions were added or removed; the sequence and parameters match the provided plan exactly.
