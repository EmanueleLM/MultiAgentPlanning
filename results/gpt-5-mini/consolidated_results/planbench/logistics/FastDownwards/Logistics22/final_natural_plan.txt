Below is a human-readable, step-by-step trace of the provided plan. Each step corresponds exactly to one action in the plan, with the stage transition used as a timestamp (time t = stage index). For each step I list the grounded action, its required preconditions at that time, its deterministic positive and negative effects, and whether the action was applicable given the facts available at that time. I also note the key state change(s) produced by the action (especially changes to next/ vase relations).

Summary conventions:
- Time: "stage_N -> stage_M" means the action advances cur from stage_N to stage_M (t = N → N+1).
- Preconditions and effects are shown as grounded predicates.
- "Applicable?" indicates whether the preconditions were satisfied at that time.
- "Key change" highlights the main relational update(s).

- (next object_12 object_5) — achieved in Step 14 and not subsequently removed.

Conclusion: Every step in the provided plan is applicable when executed in sequence from the given initial state; the deterministic effects produce the required goal facts (next object_11 object_7 and next object_12 object_5) by the end (cur stage_17). The trace above matches the supplied plan exactly, lists the time/stage for each step, and reports preconditions and effects for verification.
