Initial state (summary)
- Airports: location_0_0 (city_0), location_1_0 (city_1).
- Vehicles: truck_0 at location_0_2 (city_0); truck_1 at location_1_2 (city_1); airplane_0 at location_1_0.
- Packages: package_0 at location_0_1 (city_0); package_1 at location_1_2 (city_1).
- Temporal token: stage_0 is current. Each action consumes the current stage and produces its successor (one discrete time unit per action).

Planned steps (each step = 1 time unit, stage advances by one):

1) Time 0 → 1 — truck-drive truck_0 location_0_2 → location_0_1 (city_0) [stage_0 → stage_1]
- Agent: truck_operator_0 (controls truck_0).
- Preconditions satisfied: truck_0 is at location_0_2; location_0_2 and location_0_1 are in the same city (city_0); current stage = stage_0 and next = stage_1.
- Effects: truck_0 is no longer at location_0_2 and is now at location_0_1. Stage token becomes stage_1.

2) Time 1 → 2 — truck-load truck_0 package_0 at location_0_1 [stage_1 → stage_2]
- Agent: truck_operator_0.
- Preconditions: truck_0 is at location_0_1; package_0 is at location_0_1; current stage = stage_1.
- Effects: package_0 is removed from location_0_1 and placed inside truck_0 (in package_0 truck_0). Stage token becomes stage_2.

3) Time 2 → 3 — truck-drive truck_0 location_0_1 → location_0_2 (city_0) [stage_2 → stage_3]
- Agent: truck_operator_0.
- Preconditions: truck_0 at location_0_1; both locations in city_0; current stage = stage_2.
- Effects: truck_0 moves to location_0_2 (no longer at location_0_1). Stage token becomes stage_3.

4) Time 3 → 4 — truck-unload truck_0 package_0 at location_0_2 [stage_3 → stage_4]
- Agent: truck_operator_0.
- Preconditions: truck_0 is at location_0_2; package_0 is in truck_0; current stage = stage_3.
- Effects: package_0 is removed from truck_0 and placed at location_0_2. Stage token becomes stage_4.

5) Time 4 → 5 — truck-load truck_1 package_1 at location_1_2 [stage_4 → stage_5]
- Agent: truck_operator_1 (controls truck_1).
- Preconditions: truck_1 is at location_1_2; package_1 is at location_1_2; current stage = stage_4.
- Effects: package_1 is placed inside truck_1 (removed from location_1_2). Stage token becomes stage_5.

6) Time 5 → 6 — truck-drive truck_1 location_1_2 → location_1_0 (city_1) [stage_5 → stage_6]
- Agent: truck_operator_1.
- Preconditions: truck_1 at location_1_2; location_1_2 and location_1_0 are in the same city (city_1); current stage = stage_5.
- Effects: truck_1 moves to location_1_0 (no longer at location_1_2). Stage token becomes stage_6.

7) Time 6 → 7 — truck-unload truck_1 package_1 at location_1_0 [stage_6 → stage_7]
- Agent: truck_operator_1.
- Preconditions: truck_1 is at location_1_0; package_1 is in truck_1; current stage = stage_6.
- Effects: package_1 is placed at location_1_0 (removed from truck_1). Stage token becomes stage_7.

Result after step 7
- package_0 is at location_0_2 (goal satisfied).
- package_1 is at location_1_0 (goal satisfied).
- Total actions executed: 7. Total discrete time units: 7. (Plan cost = 7)
