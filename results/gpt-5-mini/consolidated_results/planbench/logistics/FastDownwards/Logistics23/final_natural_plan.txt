Summary: the following sequence of 7 actions exactly follows the provided plan. Each action is shown with a unit duration (1.0 time unit), preconditions that must hold at the action time (and are verified), the direct effects applied, and the relevant updated facts after each step. Total cost = 7 (7 steps × 1).

Initial relevant facts (from the problem fragment)
- hand: object_11, object_12
- sneeze: object_3, object_4
- texture: object_10, object_5, object_6, object_7, object_8, object_9
- next: (object_0,object_8), (object_11,object_6), (object_12,object_10), (object_3,object_7), (object_4,object_10)
- collect: (object_10,object_2), (object_5,object_1), (object_6,object_1), (object_7,object_1), (object_8,object_2), (object_9,object_2)
- stupendous: object_1, object_2
- spring, cats, etc. (other facts present as in the problem)

Plan steps

Step 1 — time 0.0 → 1.0 (duration 1.0)
Action: clip object_12 object_4 object_10
- Parameters: x=object_12, y=object_4, z=object_10
- Preconditions required and verified at t=0: hand(object_12), sneeze(object_4), texture(object_10), next(object_4,object_10), next(object_12,object_10) — all true in the initial state.
- Effects (applied at t=1): add vase(object_12,object_4); remove next(object_12,object_10).
- Relevant "next"/"vase" after step: next no longer contains (object_12,object_10); vase(object_12,object_4) = true.

Step 2 — time 1.0 → 2.0 (duration 1.0)
Action: wretched object_4 object_10 object_8 object_2
- Parameters: a=object_4, b=object_10, c=object_8, d=object_2
- Preconditions required and verified at t=1: sneeze(object_4), texture(object_10), texture(object_8), stupendous(object_2), next(object_4,object_10) (still true), collect(object_10,object_2), collect(object_8,object_2) — all satisfied.
- Effects (applied at t=2): add next(object_4,object_8); remove next(object_4,object_10).
- Relevant after step: next gains (object_4,object_8) and loses (object_4,object_10).

Step 3 — time 2.0 → 3.0 (duration 1.0)
Action: tightfisted object_12 object_4 object_8
- Parameters: x=object_12, y=object_4, z=object_8
- Preconditions required and verified at t=2: hand(object_12), sneeze(object_4), texture(object_8), next(object_4,object_8) (added step 2), vase(object_12,object_4) (added step 1) — all satisfied.
- Effects (applied at t=3): add next(object_12,object_8); remove vase(object_12,object_4).
- Relevant after step: next now contains (object_12,object_8) (this achieves the goal for object_12); vase(object_12,object_4) is removed.

Step 4 — time 3.0 → 4.0 (duration 1.0)
Action: wretched object_3 object_7 object_6 object_1
- Parameters: a=object_3, b=object_7, c=object_6, d=object_1
- Preconditions required and verified at t=3: sneeze(object_3), texture(object_7), texture(object_6), stupendous(object_1), next(object_3,object_7) (initial), collect(object_7,object_1), collect(object_6,object_1) — all satisfied.
- Effects (applied at t=4): add next(object_3,object_6); remove next(object_3,object_7).
- Relevant after step: next gains (object_3,object_6) and loses (object_3,object_7).

Step 5 — time 4.0 → 5.0 (duration 1.0)
Action: clip object_11 object_3 object_6
- Parameters: x=object_11, y=object_3, z=object_6
- Preconditions required and verified at t=4: hand(object_11), sneeze(object_3), texture(object_6), next(object_3,object_6) (added step 4), next(object_11,object_6) (initial) — all satisfied.
- Effects (applied at t=5): add vase(object_11,object_3); remove next(object_11,object_6).
- Relevant after step: vase(object_11,object_3) = true; next no longer contains (object_11,object_6).

Step 6 — time 5.0 → 6.0 (duration 1.0)
Action: wretched object_3 object_6 object_7 object_1
- Parameters: a=object_3, b=object_6, c=object_7, d=object_1
- Preconditions required and verified at t=5: sneeze(object_3), texture(object_6), texture(object_7), stupendous(object_1), next(object_3,object_6) (present from step 4, not removed until now), collect(object_6,object_1), collect(object_7,object_1) — all satisfied.
- Effects (applied at t=6): add next(object_3,object_7); remove next(object_3,object_6).
- Relevant after step: next regains (object_3,object_7); (object_3,object_6) removed.

Step 7 — time 6.0 → 7.0 (duration 1.0)
Action: tightfisted object_11 object_3 object_7
- Parameters: x=object_11, y=object_3, z=object_7
- Preconditions required and verified at t=6: hand(object_11), sneeze(object_3), texture(object_7), next(object_3,object_7) (added step 6), vase(object_11,object_3) (added step 5) — all satisfied.
- Effects (applied at t=7): add next(object_11,object_7); remove vase(object_11,object_3).
- Relevant after step: next now contains (object_11,object_7) (this achieves the goal for object_11); vase(object_11,object_3) is removed.

Final verification (after t=7)
- Goal predicates required: next(object_11,object_7) and next(object_12,object_8)
- Both are true in the final state: next(object_12,object_8) was created at step 3; next(object_11,object_7) was created at step 7.
- No extra actions were added or removed; all preconditions at each step were established by the initial state or by earlier actions in the sequence.

Total execution time (assuming unit duration per action) = 7.0 time units. Total cost reported in the plan = 7 (unit cost per action).
