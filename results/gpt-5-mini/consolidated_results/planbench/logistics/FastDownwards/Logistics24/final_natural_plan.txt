Below is a step-by-step, human-readable trace of the given PDDL plan. Each step matches the plan exactly, shows the originating agent (manipA = manipulator_A, manipB = manipulator_B), lists the concrete arguments, indicates the stage/time (stage_X → stage_Y) and describes the preconditions used and the effects applied in plain language. Each stage transition advances time by one discrete step.

Step 1
- Action: memory_manipb (agent: manipulator_B)
- Call: memory_manipb object_0 object_9 object_6  (stage_0 → stage_1) — time 0 → 1
- Preconditions used: now stage_0; succ stage_0 stage_1; cats(object_0); spring(object_9); spring(object_6); next(object_0, object_9).
- Effects applied: add next(object_0, object_6); delete next(object_0, object_9); advance time to stage_1.
- Plain-language: Re-route object_0's next pointer from object_9 to object_6 (object_0 now points to object_6).

Step 2
- Action: wretched_manipb (agent: manipulator_B)
- Call: wretched_manipb object_4 object_8 object_7 object_2  (stage_1 → stage_2) — time 1 → 2
- Preconditions used: now stage_1; succ stage_1 stage_2; sneeze(object_4); texture(object_8); texture(object_7); stupendous(object_2); next(object_4, object_8); collect(object_8, object_2); collect(object_7, object_2).
- Effects applied: add next(object_4, object_7); delete next(object_4, object_8); advance time to stage_2.
- Plain-language: Move object_4's next from object_8 to object_7.

Step 3
- Action: clip_manipa (agent: manipulator_A)
- Call: clip_manipa object_13 object_4 object_7  (stage_2 → stage_3) — time 2 → 3
- Preconditions used: now stage_2; succ stage_2 stage_3; hand(object_13); sneeze(object_4); texture(object_7); next(object_4, object_7); next(object_13, object_7).
- Effects applied: add vase(object_13, object_4); delete next(object_13, object_7); advance time to stage_3.
- Plain-language: Create a vase relationship linking object_13 to object_4, and remove object_13 → object_7.

Step 4
- Action: wretched_manipb (agent: manipulator_B)
- Call: wretched_manipb object_4 object_7 object_6 object_2  (stage_3 → stage_4) — time 3 → 4
- Preconditions used: now stage_3; succ stage_3 stage_4; sneeze(object_4); texture(object_7); texture(object_6); stupendous(object_2); next(object_4, object_7); collect(object_7, object_2); collect(object_6, object_2).
- Effects applied: add next(object_4, object_6); delete next(object_4, object_7); advance time to stage_4.
- Plain-language: Move object_4's next from object_7 to object_6.

Step 5
- Action: tightfisted_manipb (agent: manipulator_B)
- Call: tightfisted_manipb object_13 object_4 object_6  (stage_4 → stage_5) — time 4 → 5
- Preconditions used: now stage_4; succ stage_4 stage_5; hand(object_13); sneeze(object_4); texture(object_6); next(object_4, object_6); vase(object_13, object_4).
- Effects applied: add next(object_13, object_6); delete vase(object_13, object_4); advance time to stage_5.
- Plain-language: Use the vase(object_13,object_4) together with the link object_4→object_6 to create object_13→object_6, and remove the vase linking 13 and 4.

Step 6
- Action: sip_manipa (agent: manipulator_A)
- Call: sip_manipa object_13 object_0 object_6  (stage_5 → stage_6) — time 5 → 6
- Preconditions used: now stage_5; succ stage_5 stage_6; hand(object_13); cats(object_0); texture(object_6); next(object_13, object_6); next(object_0, object_6).
- Effects applied: add vase(object_13, object_0); delete next(object_13, object_6); advance time to stage_6.
- Plain-language: Create vase(object_13,object_0) by using both object_13→object_6 and object_0→object_6; object_13 no longer points to object_6.

Step 7
- Action: memory_manipb (agent: manipulator_B)
- Call: memory_manipb object_0 object_6 object_9  (stage_6 → stage_7) — time 6 → 7
- Preconditions used: now stage_6; succ stage_6 stage_7; cats(object_0); spring(object_6); spring(object_9); next(object_0, object_6).
- Effects applied: add next(object_0, object_9); delete next(object_0, object_6); advance time to stage_7.
- Plain-language: Restore object_0's next to object_9 (object_0 now points again to object_9).

Step 8
- Action: paltry_manipa (agent: manipulator_A)
- Call: paltry_manipa object_13 object_0 object_9  (stage_7 → stage_8) — time 7 → 8
- Preconditions used: now stage_7; succ stage_7 stage_8; hand(object_13); cats(object_0); texture(object_9); vase(object_13, object_0); next(object_0, object_9).
- Effects applied: add next(object_13, object_9); delete vase(object_13, object_0); advance time to stage_8.
- Plain-language: Create object_13→object_9 (this achieves the goal for object_13) and remove the vase linking 13 and 0.

Step 9
- Action: clip_manipa (agent: manipulator_A)
- Call: clip_manipa object_12 object_5 object_11  (stage_8 → stage_9) — time 8 → 9
- Preconditions used: now stage_8; succ stage_8 stage_9; hand(object_12); sneeze(object_5); texture(object_11); next(object_5, object_11); next(object_12, object_11).
- Effects applied: add vase(object_12, object_5); delete next(object_12, object_11); advance time to stage_9.
- Plain-language: Create vase(object_12,object_5) and remove the link object_12→object_11.

Step 10
- Action: wretched_manipb (agent: manipulator_B)
- Call: wretched_manipb object_5 object_11 object_10 object_3  (stage_9 → stage_10) — time 9 → 10
- Preconditions used: now stage_9; succ stage_9 stage_10; sneeze(object_5); texture(object_11); texture(object_10); stupendous(object_3); next(object_5, object_11); collect(object_11, object_3); collect(object_10, object_3).
- Effects applied: add next(object_5, object_10); delete next(object_5, object_11); advance time to stage_10.
- Plain-language: Move object_5's next from object_11 to object_10.

Step 11
- Action: tightfisted_manipb (agent: manipulator_B)
- Call: tightfisted_manipb object_12 object_5 object_10  (stage_10 → stage_11) — time 10 → 11
- Preconditions used: now stage_10; succ stage_10 stage_11; hand(object_12); sneeze(object_5); texture(object_10); next(object_5, object_10); vase(object_12, object_5).
- Effects applied: add next(object_12, object_10); delete vase(object_12, object_5); advance time to stage_11.
- Plain-language: Create object_12→object_10 (this achieves the goal for object_12) and remove the vase linking 12 and 5.

Final status (after Step 11, time → stage_11)
- Goal conditions achieved:
  - next(object_12, object_10) — created at Step 11
  - next(object_13, object_9) — created at Step 8

Plan cost: 11 actions (unit cost per step).
