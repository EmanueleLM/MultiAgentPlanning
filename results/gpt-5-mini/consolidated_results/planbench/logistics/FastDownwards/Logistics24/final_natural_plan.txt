Plan executed as a sequence of discrete stage-to-stage actions. I treat stage_N as timestamp t=N and each action as taking 1 time unit (start t=N, end t=N+1) to match the plan stages.

1. fly-airplane(airplane_0, location_1_0 -> location_0_0)  
   - Start: t=0 (stage_0) → End: t=1 (stage_1), Duration: 1  
   - Description: Airplane airplane_0 departs the airport at location_1_0 (city_1) and flies to the airport at location_0_0 (city_0).

2. drive-truck(truck_0, location_0_2 -> location_0_1, city_0)  
   - Start: t=1 (stage_1) → End: t=2 (stage_2), Duration: 1  
   - Description: Truck truck_0 drives within city_0 from location_0_2 to location_0_1.

3. load-truck(package_1, truck_0, location_0_1)  
   - Start: t=2 (stage_2) → End: t=3 (stage_3), Duration: 1  
   - Description: At location_0_1, truck_0 loads package_1 (package_1 is removed from location_0_1 and placed inside truck_0).

4. drive-truck(truck_0, location_0_1 -> location_0_0, city_0)  
   - Start: t=3 (stage_3) → End: t=4 (stage_4), Duration: 1  
   - Description: Truck truck_0 drives within city_0 from location_0_1 to the airport location_0_0.

5. unload-truck(package_1, truck_0, location_0_0)  
   - Start: t=4 (stage_4) → End: t=5 (stage_5), Duration: 1  
   - Description: At airport location_0_0, truck_0 unloads package_1 (package_1 is placed at location_0_0 and removed from truck_0).

6. load-airplane(package_1, airplane_0, location_0_0)  
   - Start: t=5 (stage_5) → End: t=6 (stage_6), Duration: 1  
   - Description: At airport location_0_0, airplane_0 loads package_1 (package_1 is removed from the location and placed inside airplane_0).

7. fly-airplane(airplane_0, location_0_0 -> location_1_0)  
   - Start: t=6 (stage_6) → End: t=7 (stage_7), Duration: 1  
   - Description: Airplane airplane_0 flies from the airport at location_0_0 (city_0) back to the airport at location_1_0 (city_1).

8. unload-airplane(package_1, airplane_0, location_1_0)  
   - Start: t=7 (stage_7) → End: t=8 (stage_8), Duration: 1  
   - Description: At airport location_1_0, airplane_0 unloads package_1 (package_1 is placed at location_1_0 and removed from airplane_0).  
   - Effect toward goal: package_1 is now at location_1_0 (goal satisfied for package_1).

9. load-truck(package_0, truck_1, location_1_2)  
   - Start: t=8 (stage_8) → End: t=9 (stage_9), Duration: 1  
   - Description: At location_1_2, truck_1 loads package_0 (package_0 removed from location_1_2 and placed inside truck_1).

10. drive-truck(truck_1, location_1_2 -> location_1_0, city_1)  
    - Start: t=9 (stage_9) → End: t=10 (stage_10), Duration: 1  
    - Description: Truck truck_1 drives within city_1 from location_1_2 to the airport location_1_0.

11. unload-truck(package_0, truck_1, location_1_0)  
    - Start: t=10 (stage_10) → End: t=11 (stage_11), Duration: 1  
    - Description: At location_1_0, truck_1 unloads package_0 (package_0 is placed at location_1_0 and removed from truck_1).  
    - Effect toward goal: package_0 is now at location_1_0 (goal satisfied for package_0).

12. drive-truck(truck_1, location_1_0 -> location_1_1, city_1)  
    - Start: t=11 (stage_11) → End: t=12 (stage_12), Duration: 1  
    - Description: Truck truck_1 drives within city_1 from the airport location_1_0 to location_1_1.

13. load-truck(package_2, truck_1, location_1_1)  
    - Start: t=12 (stage_12) → End: t=13 (stage_13), Duration: 1  
    - Description: At location_1_1, truck_1 loads package_2 (package_2 removed from location_1_1 and placed inside truck_1).

14. drive-truck(truck_1, location_1_1 -> location_1_2, city_1)  
    - Start: t=13 (stage_13) → End: t=14 (stage_14), Duration: 1
