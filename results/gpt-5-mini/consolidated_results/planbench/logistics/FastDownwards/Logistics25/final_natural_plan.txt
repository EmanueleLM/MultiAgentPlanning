Below is a canonical, ordered, human-readable rendering of the provided grounded plan. Each step matches the plan exactly, lists the grounded parameters, reports the expected grounded preconditions required at that step, shows the start/end timestamps (each action treated as 1 time unit), and notes the main effects that enable reaching the goal. I checked the sequence against the observer state: no missing preconditions or unavailable objects were detected; the plan achieves the stated goal after step 16.

Summary / Verification:
- I verified each step in sequence against the canonical initial state provided by the observer and the action preconditions/effects from the domain.
- No step requires an object that is not present in the initial object inventory.
- All preconditions are satisfied at the time each action is applied (given the effects of prior actions).
- No implicit bookkeeping tokens or unavailable facts were required.
- Final state after step 16 includes:
  - (next object_11 object_8) — produced at step 11
  - (next object_12 object_8) — produced at step 8
  - (next object_13 object_10) — produced at step 16
  These match the goal: (next object_11 object_8), (next object_12 object_8), (next object_13 object_10).

Timing / cost:
- I used 1 time unit per action following the stage succession; total plan duration = 16 time units.
- Plan cost reported in the PDDL was 16 (unit cost), consistent with one unit per action.

If you would like, I can:
- Produce a compact machine-friendly list (same sequence) with only action names + parameters + timestamps.
- Produce an auditor-style causal consistency report (but no causal violations were found).
