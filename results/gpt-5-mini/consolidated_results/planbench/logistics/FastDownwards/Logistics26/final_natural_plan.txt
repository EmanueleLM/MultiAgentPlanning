Legend (frequently used predicates / roles, as in the domain):
- hand: object_12, object_13, object_14
- cats: object_0, object_1
- sneeze: object_4, object_5
- texture: object_6, object_7, object_8, object_9, object_10, object_11
- stupendous: object_2, object_3
- collect, vase, next: relations between objects (see step descriptions)
Timing convention: each action is executed from stage_n → stage_n+1 and treated as 1 time unit (t = n → n+1).

Goal verification (after t = 24):
- next(object_12, object_6) — created at step 18 and never undone.
- next(object_13, object_10) — created at step 22 and never undone.
- next(object_14, object_11) — created at step 24 and never undone.

All three goal atoms are achieved at the end of the plan (t = 24). Total plan duration: 24 time units; total cost reported in plan: 24 (unit cost).
