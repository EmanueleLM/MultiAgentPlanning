Below is a clear, step-by-step, human-readable trace of the given plan. Each step follows the plan exactly, lists the time/stage transition (we treat s0 as time 0, s1 as time 1, etc.), states the required preconditions (from the domain, instantiated with the action arguments) and the concrete effects (added facts and removed facts). Each action advances the current stage by one successor (duration = 1 time unit).

Summary of timing convention: action ( ... sN sN+1 ) = executed at time N, finishes at time N+1 (duration 1).

Final state relevant to the goal (after Time 17 / current s17):
- next object_12 object_10 — added at step 16
- next object_13 object_10 — added at step 17
- next object_14 object_9 — added at step 9 and never removed

Goal check: The three goal conjuncts (next object_12 object_10), (next object_13 object_10), (next object_14 object_9) are all achieved by the end of the plan.

Notes / assumptions:
- Each action advances the single explicit "current" stage along succ links; we present this as a 1-unit duration per action (sN → sN+1).
- Preconditions listed are those in the domain schema instantiated with the provided arguments; where an instantiated precondition was required by the domain we indicate it and it held at the time the action was applied.
- No actions were added, removed or reordered—the sequence exactly matches the provided plan.
