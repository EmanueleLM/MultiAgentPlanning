Summary: each action is shown in order, with the original action name and parameters, the stage timestamp (start -> end), duration (1 stage unit), a short statement of the key precondition(s) that make the action legal at that time, and the principal effects produced. No actions are added or removed. Total plan cost = 17 (17 actions), total duration = 17 stage units.

1) plane-load airplane_0 package_1 location_0_0  (stage_0 -> stage_1)  duration 1  
   - Precondition(s) true at start: airplane_0 at location_0_0; package_1 at location_0_0; location_0_0 is an airport.

8) plane-unload airplane_0 package_1 location_1_0  (stage_7 -> stage_8)  duration 1  
   - Precondition(s): airplane_0 at location_1_0; package_1 is in-plane airplane_0; location_1_0 is an airport.  
   - Effect: package_1 becomes at location_1_0 and is no longer in-plane airplane_0.

9) plane-unload airplane_0 package_2 location_1_0  (stage_8 -> stage_9)  duration 1  
   - Precondition(s): airplane_0 at location_1_0; package_2 in-plane airplane_0; location_1_0 is an airport.  
   - Effect: package_2 becomes at location_1_0 and is no longer in-plane airplane_0.

10) drive-truck truck_1 location_1_1 location_1_0 city_1  (stage_9 -> stage_10)  duration 1  
    - Precondition(s): truck_1 at location_1_1; both locations in city_1.  
    - Effect: truck_1 moves to location_1_0.

11) truck-load truck_1 package_1 location_1_0  (stage_10 -> stage_11)  duration 1  
    - Precondition(s): truck_1 at location_1_0; package_1 at location_1_0.  
    - Effect: package_1 is removed from location_1_0 and becomes in-truck truck_1.

12) drive-truck truck_1 location_1_0 location_1_1 city_1  (stage_11 -> stage_12)  duration 1

    - Precondition(s): truck_1 at location_1_1; both locations in city_1.  
    - Effect: truck_1 moves to location_1_2.

14) truck-load truck_1 package_0 location_1_2  (stage_13 -> stage_14)  duration 1  
    - Precondition(s): truck_1 at location_1_2; package_0 at location_1_2.  
    - Effect: package_0 is removed from location_1_2 and becomes in-truck truck_1.

17) truck-unload truck_1 package_1 location_1_1  (stage_16 -> stage_17)  duration 1  
    - Precondition(s): truck_1 at location_1_1; package_1 in-truck truck_1.

Final state (after stage_17): goal satisfied
 - package_0 at location_1_1
 - package_1 at location_1_1
 - package_2 at location_1_0

All actions respect the domain constraints: loads/unloads occur only when vehicle and package are co-located and unloads remove containment, drives stay within the same city, plane flights occur between airport locations on an air-route. Total cost = 17; total plan duration = 17 stage units.
