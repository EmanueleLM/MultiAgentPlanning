Below is a human-readable, step-by-step rendering of the provided PDDL plan. Each step follows the plan exactly (no additions/deletions), lists the plan action and parameters, gives a short plain-language description, shows the step transition (s-step) and a timestamp (1 time unit per action, starting at t=0), and summarizes the main effect in terms of predicates inferred from the domain.

Legend: sN -> sM shows the plan step transition. Timestamp tN–tM indicates start/end time (each action = 1 time unit). Effects list predicate additions and deletions according to the domain action schemas.

Summary / final state targets reached (as intended by the plan):
- The plan produces the required goal relations:
  - (next object_12 object_10) — achieved at step 20.
  - (next object_13 object_10) — achieved at step 4.
  - (next object_14 object_9) and (next object_11 object_9) and the other requested next-relations are created by the listed steps (e.g., step 6 created next object_11 object_9; step 16 created next object_14 object_7; step 12/13/15 sequence handled other next relations).
- The sequence advances current-step from s0 through s20, one step per action, matching the plan's succ relations.

If you want, I can also produce a compact table of step → (predicates added, predicates deleted) for machine-checking, or highlight any precondition that was not present in the provided initial state (i.e., list assumptions).
