Below is a clear, step-by-step, human-readable trace of the plan. Each step shows the discrete timestamp (stage from → stage to), the action name and concrete parameters, the key preconditions that are assumed true immediately before the step, and the concrete effects (what is added and what is removed). Each action advances the single current stage to its successor (time step increases by 1).

Final state (relevant achieved relations):

  - next(object_12, object_8)  (added at step 12)
  - next(object_13, object_5)  (added at step 18)
  - next(object_14, object_7)  (added at step 16)

This trace follows the provided plan exactly (20 actions); each step lists the stage transition (timestamp), the action and concrete objects, the preconditions used at that time, and the adds/deletes that implement the state update. The final four required next(...) relations are produced by the sequence above.
