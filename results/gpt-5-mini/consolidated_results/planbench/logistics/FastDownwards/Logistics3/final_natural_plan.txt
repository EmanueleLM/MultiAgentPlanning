Summary: execute the four planned actions in order. Each action advances the global stage by one (stageN -> stageN+1); treat each stage transition as one time unit. After the final step the goals are satisfied: package_0 remains at location_1_0 and package_1 is at location_0_0. Total plan cost = 4.

1) Action: fly-airplane airplane_0 from location_0_0 to location_1_0
   - Time: stage0 → stage1 (duration: 1 stage / 1 time unit)
   - Preconditions satisfied before execution:
     • current-stage = stage0
     • airplane_0 is at location_0_0
     • location_0_0 is an airport
     • location_1_0 is an airport
     • there is an air-route from location_0_0 to location_1_0
   - Effects after execution:
     • airplane_0 is no longer at location_0_0 and is now at location_1_0
     • current-stage becomes stage1

2) Action: airplane-load airplane_0 loads package_1 at location_1_0
   - Time: stage1 → stage2 (duration: 1 stage / 1 time unit)
   - Preconditions satisfied before execution:
     • current-stage = stage1
     • airplane_0 is at location_1_0
     • location_1_0 is an airport
     • package_1 is at location_1_0
   - Effects after execution:
     • package_1 is removed from location_1_0 and is now in-vehicle airplane_0
     • current-stage becomes stage2

3) Action: fly-airplane airplane_0 from location_1_0 back to location_0_0
   - Time: stage2 → stage3 (duration: 1 stage / 1 time unit)
   - Preconditions satisfied before execution:
     • current-stage = stage2
     • airplane_0 is at location_1_0
     • location_1_0 and location_0_0 are airports
     • there is an air-route from location_1_0 to location_0_0
   - Effects after execution:
     • airplane_0 is no longer at location_1_0 and is now at location_0_0
     • package_1 remains in-vehicle airplane_0
     • current-stage becomes stage3

4) Action: airplane-unload airplane_0 unloads package_1 at location_0_0
   - Time: stage3 → stage4 (duration: 1 stage / 1 time unit)
   - Preconditions satisfied before execution:
     • current-stage = stage3
     • airplane_0 is at location_0_0
     • location_0_0 is an airport
     • package_1 is in-vehicle airplane_0
   - Effects after execution:
     • package_1 is removed from airplane_0 and placed at location_0_0
     • current-stage becomes stage4

Final state relevant to goal:
- package_0 remains at location_1_0 (unchanged from init) — goal clause satisfied.
- package_1 is now at location_0_0 — goal clause satisfied.

Plan cost: 4 (one per action).
