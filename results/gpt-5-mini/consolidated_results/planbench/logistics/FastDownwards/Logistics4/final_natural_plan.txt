Plan (3 steps). I report each action exactly as in the plan, with stage-based timestamps (each action advances the current stage by one). All preconditions listed were satisfied by the initial state; final goal (package_0 at location_1_1) is achieved.

1) Action: truck-load truck_1 package_0 location_1_0 stage_0 -> stage_1
   - Actor: truck_1 (truck operator)
   - Timestamp: starts at Stage 0, completes at Stage 1 (t = 0 → t = 1)
   - What happens: truck_1 loads package_0 at location_1_0.
   - Preconditions (checked): truck_1 is at location_1_0; package_0 is at location_1_0; current stage = stage_0.
   - Effects: package_0 is now in truck_1 (no longer at location_1_0); current stage becomes stage_1.

2) Action: truck-drive truck_1 location_1_0 location_1_1 city_1 stage_1 -> stage_2
   - Actor: truck_1 (truck operator)
   - Timestamp: starts at Stage 1, completes at Stage 2 (t = 1 → t = 2)
   - What happens: truck_1 drives from location_1_0 to location_1_1 within city_1.
   - Preconditions (checked): truck_1 is at location_1_0; both locations are in city_1; current stage = stage_1.
   - Effects: truck_1 is now at location_1_1 (no longer at location_1_0); any packages inside remain in the truck; current stage becomes stage_2.

3) Action: truck-unload truck_1 package_0 location_1_1 stage_2 -> stage_3
   - Actor: truck_1 (truck operator)
   - Timestamp: starts at Stage 2, completes at Stage 3 (t = 2 → t = 3)
   - What happens: truck_1 unloads package_0 at location_1_1.
   - Preconditions (checked): truck_1 is at location_1_1; package_0 is in truck_1; current stage = stage_2.
   - Effects: package_0 is now at location_1_1 (no longer in truck_1); current stage becomes stage_3.

Outcome: After these three staged actions, the goal is satisfied — package_0 is at location_1_1. (Plan cost = 3.)
