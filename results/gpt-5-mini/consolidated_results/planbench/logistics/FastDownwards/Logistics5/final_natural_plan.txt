1) Time 0 → 1 (stage s0 → s1), action: truck_operator_drive s0 s1 truck_0 location_0_0 → location_0_1 (city_0)
   - Actor: truck_operator operating truck_0.
   - Preconditions satisfied: current stage = s0; next(s0,s1) holds; truck_0 is at location_0_0; location_0_0 and location_0_1 are both in city_0; truck_0 is assigned to city_0.
   - Effects: consume stage s0 and advance to s1; truck_0 is no longer at location_0_0 and now is at location_0_1.

2) Time 1 → 2 (stage s1 → s2), action: truck_operator_load s1 s2 truck_0 package_0 location_0_1 (city_0)
   - Actor: truck_operator loads package_0 into truck_0 at location_0_1.
   - Preconditions satisfied: current stage = s1; next(s1,s2) holds; truck_0 is at location_0_1; package_0 is at location_0_1; location_0_1 is in city_0; truck_0 assigned to city_0.
   - Effects: consume stage s1 and advance to s2; package_0 is removed from location_0_1 and placed in_truck package_0 truck_0 (i.e., package_0 is now inside truck_0).

3) Time 2 → 3 (stage s2 → s3), action: truck_operator_drive s2 s3 truck_0 location_0_1 → location_0_0 (city_0)
   - Actor: truck_operator driving truck_0 back to location_0_0.
   - Preconditions satisfied: current stage = s2; next(s2,s3) holds; truck_0 is at location_0_1; both locations are in city_0; truck_0 assigned to city_0.
   - Effects: consume stage s2 and advance to s3; truck_0 is no longer at location_0_1 and now is at location_0_0. (package_0 remains in_truck truck_0.)

4) Time 3 → 4 (stage s3 → s4), action: truck_operator_unload s3 s4 truck_0 package_0 location_0_0 (city_0)
   - Actor: truck_operator unloads package_0 from truck_0 at location_0_0.
   - Preconditions satisfied: current stage = s3; next(s3,s4) holds; truck_0 is at location_0_0; package_0 is in_truck truck_0; location_0_0 is in city_0; truck_0 assigned to city_0.
   - Effects: consume stage s3 and advance to s4; package_0 is removed from in_truck and placed at location_0_0 (package_0 now at location_0_0).

5) Time 4 → 5 (stage s4 → s5), action: airplane_operator_load s4 s5 airplane_0 package_0 location_0_0 (city_0)
   - Actor: airplane_operator loads package_0 into airplane_0 at location_0_0 (an airport).
   - Preconditions satisfied: current stage = s4; next(s4,s5) holds; airplane_0 is at location_0_0; package_0 is at location_0_0; location_0_0 is an airport and is in city_0.
   - Effects: consume stage s4 and advance to s5; package_0 is removed from location_0_0 and placed in_plane package_0 airplane_0 (package_0 is now inside airplane_0).

6) Time 5 → 6 (stage s5 → s6), action: airplane_operator_fly s5 s6 airplane_0 location_0_0 → location_1_0 (city_0 → city_1)
   - Actor: airplane_operator flies airplane_0 from airport location_0_0 to airport location_1_0.
   - Preconditions satisfied: current stage = s5; next(s5,s6) holds; airplane_0 is at location_0_0; both from and to locations are airports; location_0_0 is in city_0 and location_1_0 is in city_1; city_0 and city_1 are different (inter-city flight).
   - Effects: consume stage s5 and advance to s6; airplane_0 is no longer at location_0_0 and now is at location_1_0. (package_0 remains in_plane airplane_0.)

7) Time 6 → 7 (stage s6 → s7), action: airplane_operator_unload s6 s7 airplane_0 package_0 location_1_0 (city_1)
   - Actor: airplane_operator unloads package_0 from airplane_0 at location_1_0 (airport in city_1).
   - Preconditions satisfied: current stage = s6; next(s6,s7) holds; airplane_0 is at location_1_0; package_0 is in_plane airplane_0; location_1_0 is an airport and is in city_1.
   - Effects: consume stage s6 and advance to s7; package_0 is removed from in_plane and placed at location_1_0.

Result: At time 7 (after stage s7 is reached) package_0 is at location_1_0 — the global goal is satisfied.
Notes: each action corresponds exactly to one plan step and was treated as one time unit (total cost = 7). All action preconditions and effects conform to the specification (truck actions are intra-city, airplane actions require airports and inter-city flights, and loads/unloads move the package between location and vehicle).
