Plan execution (based on Scenario A). Total cost = 3 (unit cost per action). I assign unit durations and simple timestamps for readability.

Initial relevant facts (from Scenario A)
- hand object_9
- sneeze object_3, sneeze object_4
- texture object_5, object_6, object_7, object_8
- next object_0 object_7, next object_3 object_5, next object_4 object_7, next object_9 object_7
- collect object_5 object_1, collect object_6 object_1, collect object_7 object_2, collect object_8 object_2
- spring object_5, spring object_7
- cats object_0
- stupendous object_1, stupendous object_2
(Other facts exist but the above are the ones used by the plan.)

Step 1 — clip(object_9, object_4, object_7)
- Timestamp: t = 0.0s → 1.0s
- Preconditions checked (all true initially):
  - (hand object_9)
  - (sneeze object_4)
  - (texture object_7)
  - (next object_4 object_7)
  - (next object_9 object_7)
- Effects:
  - Add: (vase object_9 object_4)
  - Delete: (next object_9 object_7)
- Rationale: Create a vase relationship between object_9 and object_4 while consuming the existing next link from object_9→object_7. This prepares a vase needed later for a tightfisted step and frees the next slot from object_9→object_7.

Step 2 — wretched(object_4, object_7, object_8, object_2)
- Timestamp: t = 1.0s → 2.0s
- Preconditions checked (all true at this time):
  - (sneeze object_4) — present initially
  - (texture object_7) — present initially
  - (texture object_8) — present initially
  - (stupendous object_2) — present initially
  - (next object_4 object_7) — still present (not affected by step 1)
  - (collect object_7 object_2) — present initially
  - (collect object_8 object_2) — present initially
- Effects:
  - Add: (next object_4 object_8)
  - Delete: (next object_4 object_7)
- Rationale: Redirect the "next" relation for object_4 from object_7 to object_8 (object_4→object_8). This produces the required next link (object_4→object_8) that will be used by the final action.

Step 3 — tightfisted(object_9, object_4, object_8)
- Timestamp: t = 2.0s → 3.0s
- Preconditions checked (all true at this time):
  - (hand object_9) — unchanged since start
  - (sneeze object_4) — present
  - (texture object_8) — present
  - (next object_4 object_8) — added by Step 2
  - (vase object_9 object_4) — added by Step 1
- Effects:
  - Add: (next object_9 object_8)
  - Delete: (vase object_9 object_4)
- Rationale: Use the vase created in Step 1 and the new next link created in Step 2 to establish the goal relation next(object_9, object_8). The vase is consumed by this action.

Final state / Goal
- After Step 3 (t = 3.0s): (next object_9 object_8) holds — goal achieved.
- Notes: All three actions’ preconditions were satisfied in sequence using only the Scenario A initial facts and effects of prior actions. No bookkeeping shortcuts were used; all causal links are explicit (adds and deletes shown above).
