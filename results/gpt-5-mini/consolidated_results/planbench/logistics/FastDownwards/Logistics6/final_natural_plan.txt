Plan summary: 7 sequential actions, each duration 1 time unit, start t=0. Goal next(object_9, object_7) is achieved at t=7.

1) t = 0 → 1 — wretched(object_3, object_5, object_6, object_1)
- Preconditions required (checked at t=0): sneeze(object_3), texture(object_5), texture(object_6), stupendous(object_1), next(object_3,object_5), collect(object_5,object_1), collect(object_6,object_1).
- Effects (applied at t=1): add next(object_3,object_6); delete next(object_3,object_5).
- Natural-language: Using object_3 (sneeze) with textures object_5 and object_6 and stupendous object_1, move the “next” relation for object_3 from object_5 to object_6.

2) t = 1 → 2 — clip(object_9, object_3, object_6)
- Preconditions (checked at t=1): hand(object_9), sneeze(object_3), texture(object_6), next(object_3,object_6), next(object_9,object_6).
- Effects (applied at t=2): add vase(object_9,object_3); delete next(object_9,object_6).
- Natural-language: With object_9 in hand and object_3 (sneeze) aligned at object_6, create vase(object_9,object_3) and remove the relation next(object_9,object_6).

3) t = 2 → 3 — wretched(object_3, object_6, object_5, object_1)
- Preconditions (checked at t=2): sneeze(object_3), texture(object_6), texture(object_5), stupendous(object_1), next(object_3,object_6), collect(object_6,object_1), collect(object_5,object_1).
- Effects (applied at t=3): add next(object_3,object_5); delete next(object_3,object_6).
- Natural-language: Using object_3 again, swap its “next” relation back from object_6 to object_5.

4) t = 3 → 4 — tightfisted(object_9, object_3, object_5)
- Preconditions (checked at t=3): hand(object_9), sneeze(object_3), texture(object_5), next(object_3,object_5), vase(object_9,object_3).
- Effects (applied at t=4): add next(object_9,object_5); delete vase(object_9,object_3).
- Natural-language: With vase(object_9,object_3) available, use it to set next(object_9,object_5) and consume (remove) the vase relationship.

5) t = 4 → 5 — sip(object_9, object_0, object_5)
- Preconditions (checked at t=4): hand(object_9), cats(object_0), texture(object_5), next(object_9,object_5), next(object_0,object_5).
- Effects (applied at t=5): add vase(object_9,object_0); delete next(object_9,object_5).
- Natural-language: Using object_9 (in hand) and the alignment at object_5, create vase(object_9,object_0) (tie object_9 to object_0) and remove next(object_9,object_5).

6) t = 5 → 6 — memory(object_0, object_5, object_7)
- Preconditions (checked at t=5): cats(object_0), spring(object_5), spring(object_7), next(object_0,object_5).
- Effects (applied at t=6): add next(object_0,object_7); delete next(object_0,object_5).
- Natural-language: Move the “next” pointer for object_0 from object_5 to object_7 (using springs on object_5 and object_7).

7) t = 6 → 7 — paltry(object_9, object_0, object_7)
- Preconditions (checked at t=6): hand(object_9), cats(object_0), texture(object_7), vase(object_9,object_0), next(object_0,object_7).
- Effects (applied at t=7): add next(object_9,object_7); delete vase(object_9,object_0).
- Natural-language: Using vase(object_9,object_0) and object_0’s updated next relation to object_7, set next(object_9,object_7). This achieves the goal.

Final state at t=7: next(object_9,object_7) holds (goal satisfied). Total cost/duration: 7 time units (7 actions × 1 unit each).
