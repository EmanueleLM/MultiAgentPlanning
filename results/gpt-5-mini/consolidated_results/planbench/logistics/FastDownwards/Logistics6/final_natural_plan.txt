Sequence of actions (one action per stage transition). Each action is assigned a 1.0 time-unit duration (stage_n → stage_n+1). All steps follow the provided plan exactly.

1) t = 0.0 → 1.0 (duration 1.0)
   Action: load_truck_1 package_0 into truck_1 at location_1_1
   Performed by: driver_1
   Preconditions satisfied: truck_1 and package_0 are co-located at location_1_1 (truck operates in city_1).
   Effect: package_0 is removed from location_1_1 and placed in-truck (in-truck package_0 truck_1).

2) t = 1.0 → 2.0 (duration 1.0)
   Action: drive_truck_1 truck_1 from location_1_1 to location_1_0
   Performed by: driver_1
   Preconditions satisfied: truck_1 is at location_1_1 and both locations are in the same city (city_1).
   Effect: truck_1 is now at location_1_0 (package_0 remains in-truck while truck moves).

3) t = 2.0 → 3.0 (duration 1.0)
   Action: unload_truck_1 package_0 from truck_1 at location_1_0
   Performed by: driver_1
   Preconditions satisfied: truck_1 is at location_1_0 and package_0 is in-truck truck_1.
   Effect: package_0 is removed from truck_1 and placed at location_1_0.
   Note: location_1_0 is an airport in city_1 (prepares for airplane loading).

4) t = 3.0 → 4.0 (duration 1.0)
   Action: load_airplane_0 package_0 into airplane_0 at location_1_0
   Performed by: pilot_0
   Preconditions satisfied: airplane_0 is at location_1_0 (an airport) and package_0 is at that same airport.
   Effect: package_0 is removed from location_1_0 and placed in-plane (in-plane package_0 airplane_0).

5) t = 4.0 → 5.0 (duration 1.0)
   Action: fly_airplane_0 airplane_0 from location_1_0 to location_0_0
   Performed by: pilot_0
   Preconditions satisfied: airplane_0 is at airport location_1_0; destination location_0_0 is also an airport (inter-city flight).
   Effect: airplane_0 (and any packages on board) move to location_0_0; package_0 remains in-plane airplane_0 during flight.

6) t = 5.0 → 6.0 (duration 1.0)
   Action: unload_airplane_0 package_0 from airplane_0 at location_0_0
   Performed by: pilot_0
   Preconditions satisfied: airplane_0 is at airport location_0_0 and package_0 is in-plane airplane_0.
   Effect: package_0 is removed from airplane_0 and placed at location_0_0.

Result after t = 6.0
- Goal achieved: package_0 is at location_0_0.
- Total plan cost (units): 6 (one unit per action).
