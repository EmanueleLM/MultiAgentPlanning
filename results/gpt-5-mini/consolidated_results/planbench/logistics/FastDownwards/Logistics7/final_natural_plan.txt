Below is a clear, step-by-step human-readable execution of the supplied plan. Each step corresponds exactly to one action in the plan (same agent-prefixed action names and parameters). I report the stage transition (serving as timestamp) for each step, list the key preconditions that are true when the step executes, and show the direct add/delete effects produced by the action. At the end I confirm the final goal is satisfied.

Plan cost (from provided plan): 6 (unit cost). Steps: 6.

Step 1 — agent_alpha_clip
- Timestamp / stage transition: stage_0 -> stage_1 (Step 1 of 6)
- Action and parameters: agent_alpha_clip(stage_0, stage_1, object_10, object_5, object_9)
- Key preconditions (true at stage_0):
  - now stage_0
  - succ stage_0 stage_1
  - hand object_10
  - sneeze object_5
  - texture object_9
  - next object_5 object_9
  - next object_10 object_9
- Effects (applied when action finishes):
  - Add: vase object_10 object_5
  - Delete: next object_10 object_9
  - Advance time: now stage_0 becomes false, now stage_1 becomes true
- Relevant resulting facts after step:
  - vase object_10 object_5 = true
  - next object_10 object_9 = false

Step 2 — agent_beta_wretched
- Timestamp / stage transition: stage_1 -> stage_2 (Step 2 of 6)
- Action and parameters: agent_beta_wretched(stage_1, stage_2, object_5, object_9, object_8, object_3)
- Key preconditions (true at stage_1):
  - now stage_1
  - succ stage_1 stage_2
  - sneeze object_5
  - texture object_9
  - texture object_8
  - stupendous object_3
  - next object_5 object_9
  - collect object_9 object_3
  - collect object_8 object_3
- Effects:
  - Add: next object_5 object_8
  - Delete: next object_5 object_9
  - Advance time: now stage_1 -> now stage_2
- Relevant resulting facts after step:
  - next object_5 object_8 = true
  - next object_5 object_9 = false

Step 3 — agent_beta_tightfisted
- Timestamp / stage transition: stage_2 -> stage_3 (Step 3 of 6)
- Action and parameters: agent_beta_tightfisted(stage_2, stage_3, object_10, object_5, object_8)
- Key preconditions (true at stage_2):
  - now stage_2
  - succ stage_2 stage_3
  - hand object_10
  - sneeze object_5
  - texture object_8
  - next object_5 object_8
  - vase object_10 object_5
- Effects:
  - Add: next object_10 object_8
  - Delete: vase object_10 object_5
  - Advance time: now stage_2 -> now stage_3
- Relevant resulting facts after step:
  - next object_10 object_8 = true
  - vase object_10 object_5 = false

Step 4 — agent_alpha_sip
- Timestamp / stage transition: stage_3 -> stage_4 (Step 4 of 6)
- Action and parameters: agent_alpha_sip(stage_3, stage_4, object_10, object_0, object_8)
- Key preconditions (true at stage_3):
  - now stage_3
  - succ stage_3 stage_4
  - hand object_10
  - cats object_0
  - texture object_8
  - next object_10 object_8
  - next object_0 object_8
- Effects:
  - Add: vase object_10 object_0
  - Delete: next object_10 object_8
  - Advance time: now stage_3 -> now stage_4
- Relevant resulting facts after step:
  - vase object_10 object_0 = true
  - next object_10 object_8 = false

Step 5 — agent_beta_memory
- Timestamp / stage transition: stage_4 -> stage_5 (Step 5 of 6)
- Action and parameters: agent_beta_memory(stage_4, stage_5, object_0, object_8, object_6)
- Key preconditions (true at stage_4):
  - now stage_4
  - succ stage_4 stage_5
  - cats object_0
  - spring object_8
  - spring object_6
  - next object_0 object_8
- Effects:
  - Add: next object_0 object_6
  - Delete: next object_0 object_8
  - Advance time: now stage_4 -> now stage_5
- Relevant resulting facts after step:
  - next object_0 object_6 = true
  - next object_0 object_8 = false

Step 6 — agent_alpha_paltry
- Timestamp / stage transition: stage_5 -> stage_6 (Step 6 of 6)
- Action and parameters: agent_alpha_paltry(stage_5, stage_6, object_10, object_0, object_6)
- Key preconditions (true at stage_5):
  - now stage_5
  - succ stage_5 stage_6
  - hand object_10
  - cats object_0
  - texture object_6
  - vase object_10 object_0
  - next object_0 object_6
- Effects:
  - Add: next object_10 object_6
  - Delete: vase object_10 object_0
  - Advance time: now stage_5 -> now stage_6
- Relevant resulting facts after step:
  - next object_10 object_6 = true
  - vase object_10 object_0 = false

Final state and goal check
- After the last action (now stage_6), the required goal fact is true:
  - next object_10 object_6 = true (goal achieved)
- All actions executed in given order and each action's preconditions were satisfied at its scheduled stage transition.
- Plan cost (given): 6.

If you want, I can present a compact timeline view (step #: agent — brief human-readable sentence) or a version that highlights only the changed predicates per step.
