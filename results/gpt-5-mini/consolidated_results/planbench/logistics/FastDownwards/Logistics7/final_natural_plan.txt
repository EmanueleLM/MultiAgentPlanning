1) load-truck(package_0, truck_1, location_1_1) — time step0 → step1 (duration: 1 time unit)
   - Preconditions (satisfied at step0): package_0 is at location_1_1; truck_1 is at location_1_1.
   - Effects (after step1): package_0 is no longer at location_1_1 and is now in truck_1.

2) drive-truck(truck_1, location_1_1 → location_1_0, city_1) — time step1 → step2 (duration: 1 time unit)
   - Preconditions (satisfied at step1): truck_1 is at location_1_1; location_1_1 and location_1_0 are in the same city (city_1).
   - Effects (after step2): truck_1 is no longer at location_1_1 and is now at location_1_0. (Any packages in truck_1 remain in the truck.)

3) unload-truck(package_0, truck_1, location_1_0) — time step2 → step3 (duration: 1 time unit)
   - Preconditions (satisfied at step2): package_0 is in truck_1; truck_1 is at location_1_0.
   - Effects (after step3): package_0 is no longer in truck_1 and is now at location_1_0.

Resulting state (after step3):
- package_0 is at location_1_0 (goal achieved).
- package_1 remains at location_0_0 (goal satisfied from the initial state).
Total plan cost: 3 (3 actions, 1 time unit each).
