Plan (human-readable steps corresponding exactly to the given PDDL plan).
Each action advances the discrete stage by one step (dayN -> dayN+1). Each action takes 1 stage unit.

1) Time: day0 → day1 (duration: 1 unit)
   Action: truck_0 loads package_0 at location_0_0.
   Who/what: truck_0 (truck) performs the load; package_0 is moved into truck_0.
   Preconditions satisfied at day0: truck_0 at location_0_0; package_0 at location_0_0.
   Effects at day1: package_0 is no longer at location_0_0 and is now in truck_0. Current stage becomes day1.

2) Time: day1 → day2 (duration: 1 unit)
   Action: truck_0 loads package_1 at location_0_0.
   Who/what: truck_0 (truck) performs the load; package_1 is moved into truck_0.
   Preconditions satisfied at day1: truck_0 at location_0_0; package_1 at location_0_0.
   Effects at day2: package_1 is no longer at location_0_0 and is now in truck_0. Current stage becomes day2.

3) Time: day2 → day3 (duration: 1 unit)
   Action: truck_0 drives from location_0_0 to location_0_1.
   Who/what: truck_0 drives within city_0 from location_0_0 to location_0_1.
   Preconditions satisfied at day2: truck_0 at location_0_0; location_0_0 and location_0_1 are in the same city.
   Effects at day3: truck_0 is no longer at location_0_0 and is now at location_0_1. Packages in truck_0 remain in the truck. Current stage becomes day3.

4) Time: day3 → day4 (duration: 1 unit)
   Action: truck_0 unloads package_0 at location_0_1.
   Who/what: truck_0 performs the unload; package_0 is removed from truck_0 and placed at location_0_1.
   Preconditions satisfied at day3: truck_0 at location_0_1; package_0 is in truck_0.
   Effects at day4: package_0 is at location_0_1 and no longer in truck_0. Current stage becomes day4.

5) Time: day4 → day5 (duration: 1 unit)
   Action: truck_0 unloads package_1 at location_0_1.
   Who/what: truck_0 performs the unload; package_1 is removed from truck_0 and placed at location_0_1.
   Preconditions satisfied at day4: truck_0 at location_0_1; package_1 is in truck_0.
   Effects at day5: package_1 is at location_0_1 and no longer in truck_0. Current stage becomes day5.

Result after day5:
- Current stage: day5 (goal stage reached).
- Delivery goal achieved: package_0 at location_0_1 and package_1 at location_0_1.
