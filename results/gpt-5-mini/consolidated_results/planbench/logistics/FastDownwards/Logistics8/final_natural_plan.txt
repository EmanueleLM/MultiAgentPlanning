Initial state (time = step_0):
- time-now = step_0 (discrete clock)
- succ relations: step_0 → step_1, step_1 → step_2, step_2 → step_3
- Facts at step_0: hand(object_9), sneeze(object_4), texture(object_7), texture(object_8)
- next(object_4, object_8), next(object_9, object_8), next(object_10, object_5)
- collect(object_8, object_2), collect(object_7, object_2), stupendous(object_2)
- (Note: cats(object_0) appears in the original spec but is not used by the planned actions)

Plan (each action advances time by one step):

Step 1 — clip object_9 object_4 object_8 (from step_0 to step_1)
- Timestamp: starts at step_0, ends at step_1.
- Preconditions checked at step_0:
  - time-now = step_0 (true)
  - succ(step_0, step_1) (true)
  - hand(object_9) (true)
  - sneeze(object_4) (true)
  - texture(object_8) (true)
  - next(object_4, object_8) (true)
  - next(object_9, object_8) (true)
- Effects (applied when time advances to step_1):
  - time-now becomes step_1 (step_0 no longer current)
  - add vase(object_9, object_4)
  - delete next(object_9, object_8)
- State after Step 1 (at step_1):
  - next(object_4, object_8) (still true)
  - next(object_9, object_8) (removed)
  - vase(object_9, object_4) (added)
  - other facts unchanged

Step 2 — wretched object_4 object_8 object_7 object_2 (from step_1 to step_2)
- Timestamp: starts at step_1, ends at step_2.
- Preconditions checked at step_1:
  - time-now = step_1 (true)
  - succ(step_1, step_2) (true)
  - sneeze(object_4) (true)
  - texture(object_8) (true)
  - texture(object_7) (true)
  - stupendous(object_2) (true)
  - next(object_4, object_8) (true)
  - collect(object_8, object_2) (true)
  - collect(object_7, object_2) (true)
- Effects (applied when time advances to step_2):
  - time-now becomes step_2
  - add next(object_4, object_7)
  - delete next(object_4, object_8)
- State after Step 2 (at step_2):
  - next(object_4, object_7) (added)
  - next(object_4, object_8) (removed)
  - vase(object_9, object_4) (still present)
  - next(object_10, object_5) (unchanged)
  - other facts unchanged

Step 3 — tightfisted object_9 object_4 object_7 (from step_2 to step_3)
- Timestamp: starts at step_2, ends at step_3.
- Preconditions checked at step_2:
  - time-now = step_2 (true)
  - succ(step_2, step_3) (true)
  - hand(object_9) (true)
  - sneeze(object_4) (true)
  - texture(object_7) (true)
  - next(object_4, object_7) (true) — produced by Step 2
  - vase(object_9, object_4) (true) — produced by Step 1
- Effects (applied when time advances to step_3):
  - time-now becomes step_3
  - add next(object_9, object_7)
  - delete vase(object_9, object_4)
- State after Step 3 (at step_3):
  - next(object_9, object_7) (added)
  - next(object_10, object_5) (remains true from the start)
  - vase(object_9, object_4) (removed)
  - other facts unchanged

Goal check (after Step 3):
- Goal requires: next(object_10, object_5) and next(object_9, object_7)
- next(object_10, object_5): true from initial state and unchanged
- next(object_9, object_7): true after Step 3
- Result: Goal satisfied.

Each action above corresponds exactly to the plan steps provided (no actions added or removed). Each action consumes one time step (step_i → step_{i+1}) and the recorded preconditions and effects match the domain specification.
