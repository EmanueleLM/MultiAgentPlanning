Step 1 — t=0.0 (duration 1.0)
Agent: truck_operator
Action: truck_operator_load(truck_0, package_0, location_0_0, stage0 → stage1)
- Preconditions satisfied: truck_0 is at location_0_0; package_0 is at location_0_0; current stage = stage0; next(stage0)=stage1.
- Effects: package_0 is now in truck_0 (in_truck package_0 truck_0); package_0 is no longer at location_0_0; current stage becomes stage1.

Step 2 — t=1.0 (duration 1.0)
Agent: truck_operator
Action: truck_operator_drive(truck_0, location_0_0 → location_0_1, city_0, stage1 → stage2)
- Preconditions satisfied: truck_0 is at location_0_0; both locations are in city_0; connected_in_city(location_0_0, location_0_1, city_0); current stage = stage1; next(stage1)=stage2.
- Effects: truck_0 is now at location_0_1; truck_0 is no longer at location_0_0; current stage becomes stage2.
- Note: package_0 remains in truck_0 during the drive.

Step 3 — t=2.0 (duration 1.0)
Agent: truck_operator
Action: truck_operator_unload(truck_0, package_0, location_0_1, stage2 → stage3)
- Preconditions satisfied: truck_0 is at location_0_1; package_0 is in truck_0; current stage = stage2; next(stage2)=stage3.
- Effects: package_0 is placed at location_0_1; package_0 is no longer in truck_0; current stage becomes stage3.

Step 4 — t=3.0 (duration 1.0)
Agent: truck_operator
Action: truck_operator_drive(truck_1, location_1_0 → location_1_1, city_1, stage3 → stage4)
- Preconditions satisfied: truck_1 is at location_1_0; both locations are in city_1; connected_in_city(location_1_0, location_1_1, city_1); current stage = stage3; next(stage3)=stage4.
- Effects: truck_1 is now at location_1_1; truck_1 is no longer at location_1_0; current stage becomes stage4.

Step 5 — t=4.0 (duration 1.0)
Agent: truck_operator
Action: truck_operator_load(truck_1, package_1, location_1_1, stage4 → stage5)
- Preconditions satisfied: truck_1 is at location_1_1; package_1 is at location_1_1; current stage = stage4; next(stage4)=stage5.
- Effects: package_1 is now in truck_1 (in_truck package_1 truck_1); package_1 is no longer at location_1_1; current stage becomes stage5.

Step 6 — t=5.0 (duration 1.0)
Agent: truck_operator
Action: truck_operator_drive(truck_1, location_1_1 → location_1_0, city_1, stage5 → stage6)
- Preconditions satisfied: truck_1 is at location_1_1; both locations are in city_1; connected_in_city(location_1_1, location_1_0, city_1); current stage = stage5; next(stage5)=stage6.
- Effects: truck_1 is now at location_1_0; truck_1 is no longer at location_1_1; current stage becomes stage6.
- Note: package_1 remains in truck_1 during the drive.

Step 7 — t=6.0 (duration 1.0)
Agent: truck_operator
Action: truck_operator_unload(truck_1, package_1, location_1_0, stage6 → stage7)
- Preconditions satisfied: truck_1 is at location_1_0; package_1 is in truck_1; current stage = stage6; next(stage6)=stage7.
- Effects: package_1 is placed at location_1_0; package_1 is no longer in truck_1; current stage becomes stage7.

Final state (after t=7.0)
- package_0 is at location_0_1
- package_1 is at location_1_0
Goal achieved: package_0 at location_0_1 AND package_1 at location_1_0.
