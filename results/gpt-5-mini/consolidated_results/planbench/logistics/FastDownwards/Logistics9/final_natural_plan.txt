Summary: The following 11-step execution follows the given plan exactly. Time is reported as integer stages t0..t11; each action consumes one stage (tN → tN+1) and moves the enabled token from sN to sN+1. For each step I show the action (agent-attributed name and parameters), the time window, the minimal preconditions relied on (from the domain), and the effect summary (what next/vase facts are added and what next/vase facts are removed). After the final step the combined goals are satisfied:
- next object_10 object_6
- next object_9 object_6
- next object_10 object_7
- next object_11 object_8

Step 1
- Action: wretched_playera object_4 object_6 object_5 object_1
- Agent / stage: player_a, s0 → s1 (t0 → t1)
- Key preconditions used: sneeze(object_4), texture(object_6), texture(object_5), stupendous(object_1), next(object_4,object_6), collect(object_6,object_1), collect(object_5,object_1)
- Effects (applied): add next(object_4,object_5); delete next(object_4,object_6)

Step 2
- Action: clip_playera object_10 object_4 object_5
- Agent / stage: player_a, s1 → s2 (t1 → t2)
- Key preconditions used: hand(object_10), sneeze(object_4), texture(object_5), next(object_4,object_5), next(object_10,object_5)
- Effects (applied): add vase(object_10,object_4); delete next(object_10,object_5)

Step 3
- Action: wretched_playera object_4 object_8 object_7 object_2
- Agent / stage: player_a, s2 → s3 (t2 → t3)
- Key preconditions used: sneeze(object_4), texture(object_8), texture(object_7), stupendous(object_2), next(object_4,object_8), collect(object_8,object_2), collect(object_7,object_2)
- Effects (applied): add next(object_4,object_7); delete next(object_4,object_8)

Step 4
- Action: tightfisted_playera object_10 object_4 object_7
- Agent / stage: player_a, s3 → s4 (t3 → t4)
- Key preconditions used: hand(object_10), sneeze(object_4), texture(object_7), next(object_4,object_7), vase(object_10,object_4)
- Effects (applied): add next(object_10,object_7); delete vase(object_10,object_4)

Step 5
- Action: clip_playera object_9 object_4 object_5
- Agent / stage: player_a, s4 → s5 (t4 → t5)
- Key preconditions used: hand(object_9), sneeze(object_4), texture(object_5), next(object_4,object_5), next(object_9,object_5)
- Effects (applied): add vase(object_9,object_4); delete next(object_9,object_5)

Step 6
- Action: wretched_playera object_4 object_7 object_6 object_2
- Agent / stage: player_a, s5 → s6 (t5 → t6)
- Key preconditions used: sneeze(object_4), texture(object_7), texture(object_6), stupendous(object_2), next(object_4,object_7), collect(object_7,object_2), collect(object_6,object_2)
- Effects (applied): add next(object_4,object_6); delete next(object_4,object_7)

Step 7
- Action: tightfisted_playera object_9 object_4 object_6
- Agent / stage: player_a, s6 → s7 (t6 → t7)
- Key preconditions used: hand(object_9), sneeze(object_4), texture(object_6), next(object_4,object_6), vase(object_9,object_4)
- Effects (applied): add next(object_9,object_6); delete vase(object_9,object_4)

Step 8
- Action: wretched_playera object_5 object_8 object_9 object_3
- Agent / stage: player_a, s7 → s8 (t7 → t8)
- Key preconditions used: sneeze(object_5), texture(object_8), texture(object_9), stupendous(object_3), next(object_5,object_8), collect(object_8,object_3), collect(object_9,object_3)
- Effects (applied): add next(object_5,object_9); delete next(object_5,object_8)

Step 9
- Action: clip_playera object_11 object_5 object_9
- Agent / stage: player_a, s8 → s9 (t8 → t9)
- Key preconditions used: hand(object_11), sneeze(object_5), texture(object_9), next(object_5,object_9), next(object_11,object_9)
- Effects (applied): add vase(object_11,object_5); delete next(object_11,object_9)

Step 10
- Action: wretched_playera object_5 object_9 object_8 object_3
- Agent / stage: player_a, s9 → s10 (t9 → t10)
- Key preconditions used: sneeze(object_5), texture(object_9), texture(object_8), stupendous(object_3), next(object_5,object_9), collect(object_9,object_3), collect(object_8,object_3)
- Effects (applied): add next(object_5,object_8); delete next(object_5,object_9)

Step 11
- Action: tightfisted_playera object_11 object_5 object_8
- Agent / stage: player_a, s10 → s11 (t10 → t11)
- Key preconditions used: hand(object_11), sneeze(object_5), texture(object_8), next(object_5,object_8), vase(object_11,object_5)
- Effects (applied): add next(object_11,object_8); delete vase(object_11,object_5)

Final state (relevant facts)
- next(object_10,object_6): true (present from initial state and never deleted)
- next(object_9,object_6): true (added at Step 7)
- next(object_10,object_7): true (added at Step 4)
- next(object_11,object_8): true (added at Step 11)

Conclusion: The plan as executed (steps 1–11, t0 → t11) is exactly the provided plan and yields the required goal conjunction: next object_10 object_6, next object_9 object_6, next object_10 object_7, and next object_11 object_8.
