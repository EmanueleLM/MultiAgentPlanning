Summary
- Plan (cost = 2, unit cost per action) executes two actions in sequence and achieves the goal craves(c, a).
- Time model: each action takes 1 time unit. Step 1 executes from t = 0 to t = 1; Step 2 executes from t = 1 to t = 2.

Initial relevant facts (t = 0)
- craves(a, b)
- craves(d, c)
- harmony
- planet(b)
- planet(c)
- province(a)
- province(d)
- curr(s0)
- succ(s0, s1), succ(s1, s2), succ(s2, s3)

Plan steps

Step 1 — feaster_feast d c (agent: feaster)
- Action name / parameters: feaster_feast(consumer = d, prey = c, from-stage = s0, to-stage = s1)
- Time: t = 0 → t = 1 (duration 1)
- Preconditions checked at t = 0:
  - curr(s0) — true
  - succ(s0, s1) — true
  - craves(d, c) — true
  - province(d) — true
  - harmony — true
- Effects applied at t = 1:
  - Removed: curr(s0), craves(d, c), province(d), harmony
  - Added: curr(s1), pain, province(c)
- State changes (difference):
  - craves(d, c) is deleted
  - province(d) is deleted
  - harmony is deleted
  - curr(s0) → curr(s1)
  - pain becomes true
  - province(c) becomes true

State after Step 1 (t = 1) — relevant facts
- craves(a, b)
- craves(d, c) — deleted
- harmony — deleted
- planet(b), planet(c)
- province(a) (unchanged)
- province(d) — deleted
- province(c) — added
- pain — true
- curr(s1)
- succ(s1, s2), succ(s2, s3)

Step 2 — overcomer_overcome c a (agent: overcomer)
- Action name / parameters: overcomer_overcome(winner = c, loser = a, from-stage = s1, to-stage = s2)
- Time: t = 1 → t = 2 (duration 1)
- Preconditions checked at t = 1:
  - curr(s1) — true (set by Step 1)
  - succ(s1, s2) — true
  - province(a) — true (remained from initial state)
  - pain — true (set by Step 1)
- Effects applied at t = 2:
  - Removed: curr(s1), province(a), pain
  - Added: curr(s2), harmony, province(c) (already true, remains true), craves(c, a)
- State changes (difference):
  - curr(s1) is deleted; curr(s2) is added
  - province(a) is deleted
  - pain is deleted
  - harmony becomes true
  - craves(c, a) becomes true (goal achieved)
  - province(c) is added/maintained

Final state (t = 2)
- craves(c, a) — true (goal satisfied)
- harmony — true
- curr(s2)
- province(c)
- planet(b), planet(c)
- craves(a, b) (unchanged from initial)
- Other facts updated as above

Total cost: 2 (each action cost 1)

Notes on compliance with the specification
- Action names are namespaced by agent (feaster_feast, overcomer_overcome) as required.
- The sequence exactly matches the provided plan: (feaster_feast d c s0 s1) then (overcomer_overcome c a s1 s2). No actions were added or removed.
- Preconditions were satisfied at each step given the provided initial state and the explicit effects of earlier steps.
- The goal craves(c, a) is achieved at t = 2.
