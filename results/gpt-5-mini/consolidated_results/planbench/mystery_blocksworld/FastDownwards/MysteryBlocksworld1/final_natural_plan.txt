Plan summary (total cost = 2; each action = 1 time unit):

Step 1 — Time 0.0 → 1.0 (duration 1)
- Action: feaster_feast b c (from s1 to s2)
- Actor: feaster
- Parameters: x = b, other = c, from = s1, to = s2
- Preconditions checked (all true at time 0): 
  - craves(b, c)
  - province(b)
  - harmony
  - at-stage(s1)
  - next(s1, s2)
- Effects applied at time 1:
  - Added: pain, province(c)
  - Deleted: craves(b, c), province(b), harmony
  - Stage advance: removed at-stage(s1), added at-stage(s2)
- State after step 1 (relevant facts):
  - craves(c, d) — unchanged
  - craves(d, a) — unchanged
  - craves(b, c) — deleted
  - province(b) — deleted
  - province(c) — present
  - harmony — deleted
  - pain — present
  - at-stage(s2) — present

Step 2 — Time 1.0 → 2.0 (duration 1)
- Action: overcomer_overcome a c (from s2 to s3)
- Actor: overcomer
- Parameters: x = a, other = c, from = s2, to = s3
- Preconditions checked (all true at time 1): 
  - province(c)
  - pain
  - at-stage(s2)
  - next(s2, s3)
- Effects applied at time 2:
  - Added: harmony, province(a), craves(a, c)
  - Deleted: province(c), pain
  - Stage advance: removed at-stage(s2), added at-stage(s3)
- State after step 2 (relevant facts):
  - craves(a, c) — added (satisfies part of goal)
  - craves(d, a) — unchanged from initial (satisfies other part of goal)
  - province(a) — present
  - harmony — present
  - pain — deleted
  - at-stage(s3) — present

Goal check (final state at time 2):
- craves(a, c) — true
- craves(d, a) — true
=> Global goal achieved.
