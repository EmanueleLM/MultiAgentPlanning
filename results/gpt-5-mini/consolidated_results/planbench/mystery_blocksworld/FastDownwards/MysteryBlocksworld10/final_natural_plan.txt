1) Step 1 — feaster-feast(object_b, object_d, province_b) — time: stage1 → stage2 (timestamp t=1, duration 1)
- Preconditions (satisfied at start of step): 
  - object_b craves object_d
  - object_b controls province_b
  - harmony holds
  - current stage = stage1 (next(stage1, stage2) exists)
- Action effect summary (applied as the action executes):
  - Added: pain(object_b), controls(object_d, province_b)
  - Deleted: craves(object_b, object_d), controls(object_b, province_b), harmony
  - Stage advance: current stage becomes stage2 (stage1 no longer current)
- Resulting notable facts after step: 
  - object_b is in pain
  - object_d now controls province_b
  - harmony is false
  - craves(object_b, object_d) no longer holds

2) Step 2 — overcomer-overcome(object_b, object_c, province_c) — time: stage2 → stage3 (timestamp t=2, duration 1)
- Preconditions (satisfied at start of step): 
  - controls(object_c, province_c)
  - pain(object_b)
  - current stage = stage2 (next(stage2, stage3) exists)
- Action effect summary:
  - Added: harmony, controls(object_b, province_c), craves(object_b, object_c)
  - Deleted: controls(object_c, province_c), pain(object_b)
  - Stage advance: current stage becomes stage3 (stage2 no longer current)
- Resulting notable facts after step:
  - object_b now controls province_c
  - object_b craves object_c (this fulfills the first part of the goal)
  - object_b is no longer in pain
  - harmony restored

3) Step 3 — attacker-attack(object_d, province_b) — time: stage3 → stage4 (timestamp t=3, duration 1)
- Preconditions (satisfied at start of step): 
  - controls(object_d, province_b)
  - planet(object_d) (from initial facts)
  - harmony holds
  - current stage = stage3 (next(stage3, stage4) exists)
- Action effect summary:
  - Added: pain(object_d)
  - Deleted: controls(object_d, province_b), planet(object_d), harmony
  - Stage advance: current stage becomes stage4 (stage3 no longer current)
- Resulting notable facts after step:
  - object_d is in pain
  - object_d no longer controls province_b
  - planet(object_d) no longer holds
  - harmony is false

4) Step 4 — overcomer-overcome(object_d, object_a, province_a) — time: stage4 → stage5 (timestamp t=4, duration 1)
- Preconditions (satisfied at start of step): 
  - controls(object_a, province_a)
  - pain(object_d)
  - current stage = stage4 (next(stage4, stage5) exists)
- Action effect summary:
  - Added: harmony, controls(object_d, province_a), craves(object_d, object_a)
  - Deleted: controls(object_a, province_a), pain(object_d)
  - Stage advance: current stage becomes stage5 (stage4 no longer current)
- Resulting notable facts after step:
  - object_d now craves object_a
  - object_d controls province_a
  - object_d is no longer in pain
  - harmony is true

Final outcome (after t=4, stage5):
- Goal achieved: craves(object_b, object_c) and craves(object_d, object_a) both hold.
