Summary: the following 6 actions reproduce the plan exactly. Each action uses the same agent-prefixed name and parameters as in the provided plan. I list a timestamp (start — end, unit duration = 1), the action, the preconditions checked at that time, the effects applied, and the resulting key state changes. Initial state (t=0, before any action):
- craves(c, b), craves(d, a)
- harmony
- planet(a), planet(b)
- province(c), province(d)
- current = s0
- successor links: s0→s1, s1→s2, s2→s3, s3→s4, s4→s5, s5→s6

Step 1 — t=0 → t=1 (duration 1)
Action: feaster-feast d a s0 s1
- Preconditions checked: craves(d, a) (true), province(d) (true), harmony (true), current = s0 (true), succ(s0, s1) (true).
- Effects applied:
  - Add: pain(d), province(a)
  - Delete: craves(d, a), province(d), harmony
  - Advance stage: current s0 removed, current s1 added
- Resulting highlights after t=1:
  - pain(d) present
  - province(a) now present (in addition to any existing facts)
  - craves(d, a) removed
  - province(d) removed
  - harmony no longer true
  - current = s1

Step 2 — t=1 → t=2 (duration 1)
Action: succumber-succumb d s1 s2
- Preconditions checked: pain(d) (true), current = s1 (true), succ(s1, s2) (true).
- Effects applied:
  - Add: province(d), planet(d), harmony
  - Delete: pain(d)
  - Advance stage: current s1 removed, current s2 added
- Resulting highlights after t=2:
  - province(d) restored
  - planet(d) now true
  - pain(d) removed
  - harmony restored (true)
  - current = s2

Step 3 — t=2 → t=3 (duration 1)
Action: feaster-feast c b s2 s3
- Preconditions checked: craves(c, b) (true), province(c) (true), harmony (true), current = s2 (true), succ(s2, s3) (true).
- Effects applied:
  - Add: pain(c), province(b)
  - Delete: craves(c, b), province(c), harmony
  - Advance stage: current s2 removed, current s3 added
- Resulting highlights after t=3:
  - pain(c) present
  - province(b) now present
  - craves(c, b) removed
  - province(c) removed
  - harmony no longer true
  - current = s3

Step 4 — t=3 → t=4 (duration 1)
Action: succumber-succumb c s3 s4
- Preconditions checked: pain(c) (true), current = s3 (true), succ(s3, s4) (true).
- Effects applied:
  - Add: province(c), planet(c), harmony
  - Delete: pain(c)
  - Advance stage: current s3 removed, current s4 added
- Resulting highlights after t=4:
  - province(c) restored
  - planet(c) now true
  - pain(c) removed
  - harmony restored (true)
  - current = s4

Step 5 — t=4 → t=5 (duration 1)
Action: attacker-attack a d s4 s5
- Preconditions checked: province(a) (true — from Step 1), planet(d) (true — from Step 2), harmony (true), current = s4 (true), succ(s4, s5) (true).
- Effects applied:
  - Add: pain(a)
  - Delete: province(a), planet(d), harmony
  - Advance stage: current s4 removed, current s5 added
- Resulting highlights after t=5:
  - pain(a) present
  - province(a) removed
  - planet(d) removed
  - harmony no longer true
  - current = s5

Step 6 — t=5 → t=6 (duration 1)
Action: overcomer-overcome a b s5 s6
- Preconditions checked: pain(a) (true), province(b) (true — from Step 3), current = s5 (true), succ(s5, s6) (true).
- Effects applied:
  - Add: harmony, province(a), craves(a, b)
  - Delete: province(b), pain(a)
  - Advance stage: current s5 removed, current s6 added
- Resulting highlights after t=6 (final state):
  - craves(a, b) — GOAL achieved
  - harmony true
  - province(a) present
  - province(b) removed
  - pain(a) removed
  - current = s6

Goal check: craves(a, b) holds in the final state (t=6). Plan executed exactly as given, with unit-duration steps (total cost = 6).
