Summary of objects and initial facts (time t0):
- Objects: a, b, c, d
- Initial facts: craves(a,b), craves(b,c), craves(c,d), harmony, planet(d), province(a)
- Time phase: current = ph1
- Convention: each action executes in one time-step. Action i runs at timestamp ti and advances current from phi to phi+1.

Plan (12 steps). For each step: timestamp, agent action(parameters), preconditions checked, effects (added / deleted).

1) t1 — feaster-feast(a, b) [ph1 → ph2]
- Preconditions checked: craves(a,b), province(a), harmony
- Effects added: pain(a), province(b)
- Effects deleted: craves(a,b), province(a), harmony

2) t2 — succumber-succumb(a) [ph2 → ph3]
- Preconditions checked: pain(a)
- Effects added: province(a), planet(a), harmony
- Effects deleted: pain(a)

3) t3 — feaster-feast(b, c) [ph3 → ph4]
- Preconditions checked: craves(b,c), province(b), harmony
- Effects added: pain(b), province(c)
- Effects deleted: craves(b,c), province(b), harmony

4) t4 — succumber-succumb(b) [ph4 → ph5]
- Preconditions checked: pain(b)
- Effects added: province(b), planet(b), harmony
- Effects deleted: pain(b)

5) t5 — feaster-feast(c, d) [ph5 → ph6]
- Preconditions checked: craves(c,d), province(c), harmony
- Effects added: pain(c), province(d)
- Effects deleted: craves(c,d), province(c), harmony

6) t6 — succumber-succumb(c) [ph6 → ph7]
- Preconditions checked: pain(c)
- Effects added: province(c), planet(c), harmony
- Effects deleted: pain(c)

7) t7 — attacker-attack(d) [ph7 → ph8]
- Preconditions checked: province(d), planet(d), harmony
- Effects added: pain(d)
- Effects deleted: province(d), planet(d), harmony

8) t8 — overcomer-overcome(d, a) [ph8 → ph9]
- Preconditions checked: province(a), pain(d)
- Effects added: harmony, province(d), craves(d,a)
- Effects deleted: province(a), pain(d)

9) t9 — attacker-attack(c) [ph9 → ph10]
- Preconditions checked: province(c), planet(c), harmony
- Effects added: pain(c)
- Effects deleted: province(c), planet(c), harmony

10) t10 — overcomer-overcome(c, d) [ph10 → ph11]
- Preconditions checked: province(d), pain(c)
- Effects added: harmony, province(c), craves(c,d)
- Effects deleted: province(d), pain(c)

11) t11 — attacker-attack(b) [ph11 → ph12]
- Preconditions checked: province(b), planet(b), harmony
- Effects added: pain(b)
- Effects deleted: province(b), planet(b), harmony

12) t12 — overcomer-overcome(b, c) [ph12 → ph13]
- Preconditions checked: province(c), pain(b)
- Effects added: harmony, province(b), craves(b,c)
- Effects deleted: province(c), pain(b)

Final state (after t12):
- craves(b,c) — reintroduced at step 12
- craves(c,d) — reintroduced at step 10
- craves(d,a) — introduced at step 8
These satisfy the goal: craves(b,c), craves(c,d), craves(d,a).

Each action advanced the current phase by one step (ph1 → ph13 overall). Each step above matches the provided plan exactly (no actions added or removed).
