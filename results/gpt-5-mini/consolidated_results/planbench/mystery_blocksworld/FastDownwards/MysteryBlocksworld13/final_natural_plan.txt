Summary: Each action takes 1 time unit. Times shown as t0, t1, … t6. The sequence below exactly follows the provided plan and leads to the goal (craves a c) and (craves b a).

1) Time t0 → t1 — feaster performs Feast on (c) from (b)
- Action: feaster-feast c b (stage s0 → s1)
- Preconditions (satisfied at s0): craves(c, b), province(c), harmony
- Effects (applied at s1): remove craves(c, b); remove province(c); remove harmony; add pain(c); add province(b)
- Note: Initial state included craves(c, b), province(c), and harmony, so this action is allowed.

2) Time t1 → t2 — succumb performs Succumb on (c)
- Action: succumb-succumb c (stage s1 → s2)
- Preconditions (satisfied at s1): pain(c)
- Effects (applied at s2): remove pain(c); add province(c); add planet(c); add harmony
- Note: Step 1 created pain(c), enabling this recovery action and restoring province(c), planet(c), and harmony.

3) Time t2 → t3 — attacker performs Attack on (a)
- Action: attacker-attack a (stage s2 → s3)
- Preconditions (satisfied at s2): province(a), planet(a), harmony
- Effects (applied at s3): remove province(a); remove planet(a); remove harmony; add pain(a)
- Note: province(a) and planet(a) were true initially, harmony was restored in step 2, so the attack is permitted.

4) Time t3 → t4 — overcomer performs Overcome: a overcomes c
- Action: overcomer-overcome a c (stage s3 → s4)
- Preconditions (satisfied at s3): pain(a), province(c), a ≠ c
- Effects (applied at s4): remove pain(a); remove province(c); add province(a); add craves(a, c); add harmony
- Note: Step 3 produced pain(a); step 2 left province(c) true, so this yields craves(a, c) and restores harmony.

5) Time t4 → t5 — feaster performs Feast on (b) from (d)
- Action: feaster-feast b d (stage s4 → s5)
- Preconditions (satisfied at s4): craves(b, d), province(b), harmony
- Effects (applied at s5): remove craves(b, d); remove province(b); remove harmony; add pain(b); add province(d)
- Note: craves(b, d) was true initially; province(b) was created in step 1; harmony was present after step 4 — so this action is valid.

6) Time t5 → t6 — overcomer performs Overcome: b overcomes a
- Action: overcomer-overcome b a (stage s5 → s6)
- Preconditions (satisfied at s5): pain(b), province(a), b ≠ a
- Effects (applied at s6): remove pain(b); remove province(a); add province(b); add craves(b, a); add harmony
- Note: Step 5 created pain(b); step 4 restored province(a); therefore this produces craves(b, a).

Final state (after t6)
- craves(a, c) — created in step 4
- craves(b, a) — created in step 6
- harmony is true (restored in step 6)
- The specified goal (craves a c) and (craves b a) is achieved.

Total plan duration / cost: 6 steps (unit cost per action), matching the provided plan.
