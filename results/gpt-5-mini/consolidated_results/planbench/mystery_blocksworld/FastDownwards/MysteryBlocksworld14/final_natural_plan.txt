Summary: Execute the four actions in the given order. Each action is listed with a timestamp (assume each action takes 1 time unit), the required preconditions (checked against the current state), and the immediate effects. The plan cost = 4. Start state (t=0) contains:
- (craves d c)
- (harmony)
- (planet a), (planet b), (planet c)
- (province a), (province b), (province d)
- (pain) is false
Goal: (craves c b) and (craves d a)

Step 1 — t = 0 → 1
Action: feast d c
- Intended meaning: d feasts on c (parameters x=d, y=c).
- Required preconditions (from the model): (craves d c), (province d), (harmony).
- Preconditions check at t=0: all hold (listed in start state).
- Effects applied at t=1:
  - Add: (pain), (province c)
  - Delete: (craves d c), (province d), (harmony)
- State after step 1 (t=1), relevant facts:
  - (pain) — now true
  - (province c) — now true
  - (craves d c) — removed
  - (province d) — removed
  - (harmony) — removed
  - Remaining unchanged from start: (planet a), (planet b), (planet c), (province a), (province b)

Step 2 — t = 1 → 2
Action: overcome c b
- Intended meaning: c overcomes b (parameters x=c, y=b).
- Required preconditions: (province b), (pain).
- Preconditions check at t=1: (province b) is true (from start) and (pain) is true (set by step 1) → OK.
- Effects applied at t=2:
  - Add: (harmony), (province c) (already true), (craves c b)
  - Delete: (province b), (pain)
- State after step 2 (t=2), relevant facts:
  - (harmony) — restored
  - (craves c b) — added (first goal conjunct satisfied)
  - (province b) — removed
  - (pain) — removed
  - (province c) — remains true
  - (province a) remains true
  - (province d) remains false
  - (planet a),(planet b),(planet c) remain as before

Step 3 — t = 2 → 3
Action: attack c
- Intended meaning: attack object c (parameter o=c).
- Required preconditions: (province c), (planet c), (harmony).
- Preconditions check at t=2: (province c) is true, (planet c) is true (from start), and (harmony) is true (restored at step 2) → OK.
- Effects applied at t=3:
  - Add: (pain)
  - Delete: (province c), (planet c), (harmony)
  - Note: (craves c b) is not deleted by attack, so it persists.
- State after step 3 (t=3), relevant facts:
  - (pain) — true again
  - (craves c b) — still true (goal conjunct remains true)
  - (province c) — removed
  - (planet c) — removed
  - (harmony) — removed
  - (province a) still true, (province b) false, (province d) false

Step 4 — t = 3 → 4
Action: overcome d a
- Intended meaning: d overcomes a (parameters x=d, y=a).
- Required preconditions: (province a), (pain).
- Preconditions check at t=3: (province a) is true (from start) and (pain) is true (set by step 3) → OK.
- Effects applied at t=4:
  - Add: (harmony), (province d), (craves d a)
  - Delete: (province a), (pain)
- State after step 4 (t=4), relevant facts:
  - (craves c b) — true (from step 2)
  - (craves d a) — true (added now; second goal conjunct satisfied)
  - (harmony) — true
  - (province d) — restored
  - (province a) — removed
  - (pain) — removed

Final check (t=4): Both goal atoms hold:
- (craves c b) — true
- (craves d a) — true

Plan cost: 4 actions, cost = 4. The sequence (feast d c) → (overcome c b) → (attack c) → (overcome d a) is valid under the provided action schemata and reaches the stated goal.
