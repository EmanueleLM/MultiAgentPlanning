Final status (after t = 21)
- The goal facts for scenario_A are satisfied:
  - (next object_10 object_6) — created at t = 17
  - (next object_11 object_7) — created at t = 21
  - (next object_12 object_7) — created at t = 20
  - (next object_9 object_6) — created at t = 16
- Total steps (cost) = 22

Notes:
- Each step is shown with its action-specific preconditions and effects according to the domain definition supplied.
- Timestamps are simple integer steps with an assumed duration of 1 unit per action for readability.
