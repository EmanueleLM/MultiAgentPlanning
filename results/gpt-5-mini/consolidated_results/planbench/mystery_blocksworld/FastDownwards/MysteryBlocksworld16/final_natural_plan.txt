Summary: four actions executed in sequence exactly as in the provided plan. Each action takes 1 time unit (plan cost = 4). Time starts at t=0.

1) t = 0.0 → 1.0 — executor-execute(orchestrator, s_assess, p1 → p2, r1)
- Performed by: executor-execute with the agent parameter bound to "orchestrator".
- Step acted on: s_assess (assigned to orchestrator).
- Preconditions satisfied at start: current-phase = p1, step-of(s_assess) = p1, s_assess not completed, successor(p1,p2).
- Effects applied at completion: completed(s_assess) becomes true; current-phase switches from p1 to p2; result-generated(r1) becomes true.
- Notes: this matches plan entry (executor-execute orchestrator s_assess p1 p2 r1).

2) t = 1.0 → 2.0 — executor-execute(orchestrator, s_prepare, p2 → p3, r1)
- Performed by: executor-execute with the agent parameter bound to "orchestrator".
- Step acted on: s_prepare (assigned to orchestrator).
- Preconditions satisfied at start: current-phase = p2, step-of(s_prepare) = p2, s_prepare not completed, successor(p2,p3).
- Effects applied at completion: completed(s_prepare) becomes true; current-phase switches from p2 to p3; result-generated(r1) remains true (generated again or idempotently true).
- Notes: this matches plan entry (executor-execute orchestrator s_prepare p2 p3 r1).

3) t = 2.0 → 3.0 — executor-execute(executor, s_execute, p3 → p4, r1)
- Performed by: executor-execute with the agent parameter bound to "executor".
- Step acted on: s_execute (assigned to executor).
- Preconditions satisfied at start: current-phase = p3, step-of(s_execute) = p3, s_execute not completed, successor(p3,p4).
- Effects applied at completion: completed(s_execute) becomes true; current-phase switches from p3 to p4; result-generated(r1) remains true (may be set again).
- Notes: this matches plan entry (executor-execute executor s_execute p3 p4 r1).

4) t = 3.0 → 4.0 — auditor-verify(auditor, s_verify, p4 → p5, r1)
- Performed by: auditor-verify with the agent parameter bound to "auditor".
- Step acted on: s_verify (assigned to auditor).
- Preconditions satisfied at start: current-phase = p4, step-of(s_verify) = p4, s_verify not completed, successor(p4,p5), result-generated(r1) is true (produced previously).
- Effects applied at completion: completed(s_verify) becomes true; verified(r1) becomes true; current-phase switches from p4 to p5.
- Notes: this matches plan entry (auditor-verify auditor s_verify p4 p5 r1).

Final state after t = 4.0
- completed(s_assess), completed(s_prepare), completed(s_execute), completed(s_verify) are all true.
- result-generated(r1) is true and verified(r1) is true.
- current-phase = p5 (terminal phase).
This satisfies the problem goal exactly.
