Plan (human-readable, follows the given plan exactly). Each step lists the action, the stage transition (timestamp), the required preconditions that hold immediately before the action, and the effects produced immediately after the action.

1) Action: Feast(c, a) — transition st0 → st1
- Timestamp: executes between st0 and st1 (now st0, next st0 st1).
- Preconditions (all true just before the action):
  - now st0
  - next st0 st1
  - craves(c, a)
  - province(c)
  - harmony
- Effects (state changes after the action):
  - now st0 is cleared; now st1 becomes true
  - pain becomes true
  - province(a) becomes true
  - craves(c, a) is removed
  - province(c) is removed
  - harmony is removed

2) Action: Overcome(d, b) — transition st1 → st2
- Timestamp: executes between st1 and st2 (now st1, next st1 st2).
- Preconditions (all true just before the action):
  - now st1
  - next st1 st2
  - province(b)
  - pain
- Effects (state changes after the action):
  - now st1 is cleared; now st2 becomes true
  - harmony becomes true
  - province(d) becomes true
  - craves(d, b) becomes true
  - province(b) is removed
  - pain is removed

3) Action: Attack(d) — transition st2 → st3
- Timestamp: executes between st2 and st3 (now st2, next st2 st3).
- Preconditions (all true just before the action):
  - now st2
  - next st2 st3
  - province(d)
  - planet(d)
  - harmony
- Effects (state changes after the action):
  - now st2 is cleared; now st3 becomes true
  - pain becomes true
  - province(d) is removed
  - planet(d) is removed
  - harmony is removed

4) Action: Overcome(b, a) — transition st3 → st4
- Timestamp: executes between st3 and st4 (now st3, next st3 st4).
- Preconditions (all true just before the action):
  - now st3
  - next st3 st4
  - province(a)
  - pain
- Effects (state changes after the action):
  - now st3 is cleared; now st4 becomes true
  - harmony becomes true
  - province(b) becomes true
  - craves(b, a) becomes true
  - province(a) is removed
  - pain is removed

5) Action: Feast(b, d) — transition st4 → st5
- Timestamp: executes between st4 and st5 (now st4, next st4 st5).
- Preconditions (all true just before the action):
  - now st4
  - next st4 st5
  - craves(b, d)
  - province(b)
  - harmony
- Effects (state changes after the action):
  - now st4 is cleared; now st5 becomes true
  - pain becomes true
  - province(d) becomes true
  - craves(b, d) is removed
  - province(b) is removed
  - harmony is removed

6) Action: Overcome(c, d) — transition st5 → st6
- Timestamp: executes between st5 and st6 (now st5, next st5 st6).
- Preconditions (all true just before the action):
  - now st5
  - next st5 st6
  - province(d)
  - pain
- Effects (state changes after the action):
  - now st5 is cleared; now st6 becomes true
  - harmony becomes true
  - province(c) becomes true
  - craves(c, d) becomes true
  - province(d) is removed
  - pain is removed

Final result (after step 6, at stage st6):
- craves(b, a) — achieved in step 4 and not removed afterwards
- craves(c, d) — achieved in step 6
- craves(d, b) — achieved in step 2
These three craving goals are satisfied.
