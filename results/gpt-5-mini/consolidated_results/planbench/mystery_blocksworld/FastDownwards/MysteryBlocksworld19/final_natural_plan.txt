Step 1 — t = 0.0 → 1.0 (duration 1.0)
Action: attack-action on b

Preconditions checked at t=0:
- has-province(b) — TRUE
- at-planet(b) — TRUE
- harmony — TRUE

Immediate effects at t=1:
- Adds: in-pain(b)
- Deletes: has-province(b), at-planet(b), harmony

Relevant facts after Step 1 (keeping unchanged facts from initial state unless listed above):
- craves(a, c) — still TRUE
- craves(d, a) — still TRUE
- at-planet(c) — still TRUE
- has-province(d) — still TRUE
- in-pain(b) — TRUE
- harmony — FALSE

Step 2 — t = 1.0 → 2.0 (duration 1.0)
Action: overcome-action on (obj = b, other = d)

Preconditions checked at t=1:
- in-pain(b) — TRUE (from Step 1)
- has-province(d) — TRUE
- distinct(b, d) — TRUE (assumed/ensured by domain)

Immediate effects at t=2:
- Adds: has-province(b), craves(b, d), harmony
- Deletes: in-pain(b), has-province(d)

Relevant facts after Step 2 (final state):
- craves(a, c) — TRUE (unchanged)
- craves(b, d) — TRUE (added by Step 2)
- craves(d, a) — TRUE (unchanged)
- has-province(b) — TRUE (reinstated)
- has-province(d) — FALSE
- at-planet(c) — TRUE
- harmony — TRUE
- in-pain(b) — FALSE

Plan cost/length: 2 actions (unit cost each) — total cost = 2.

Goal verification:
- craves(a, c) — TRUE
- craves(b, d) — TRUE
- craves(d, a) — TRUE

All three goal craves are satisfied in the final state.
