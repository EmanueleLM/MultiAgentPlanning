Summary of action semantics (for reference)
- feast actor other: requires (craves actor other), (province actor), (harmony). Effects: sets (pain actor), gives (province other), removes (craves actor other), removes (province actor), removes (harmony). Advances stage.
- succumb victim by: requires (pain victim). Effects: gives (province by), makes (planet victim), restores (harmony), removes (pain victim). Advances stage.
- attack attacker target: requires (province attacker), (planet target), (harmony). Effects: sets (pain target), removes (province attacker), removes (planet target), removes (harmony). Advances stage.
- overcome actor other: requires (province other), (pain actor). Effects: restores (harmony), gives (province actor), adds (craves actor other), removes (province other), removes (pain actor). Advances stage.

All actions are unit cost; I report timestamps as integer time steps (each action runs for 1 time unit). Stages indicate the discrete step advancement (s0→s1 etc.).

Plan (timestamps, preconditions, and effects)

1) Time 0 → 1: Feast (d feasts on a) — (feast d a s0 → s1)
- Preconditions (before action): craves(d,a), province(d), harmony
  (these are true in the initial state)
- Effects (after action):
  - + pain(d)
  - + province(a)
  - - craves(d,a)
  - - province(d)
  - - harmony
  - stage advanced s0 → s1

Relevant resulting facts after step: pain(d), province(a), (craves d a removed), (harmony false).

2) Time 1 → 2: Succumb (d succumbs; province given to b) — (succumb d b s1 → s2)
- Preconditions: pain(d)
- Effects:
  - + province(b)
  - + planet(d)
  - + harmony
  - - pain(d)
  - stage advanced s1 → s2

Relevant resulting facts after step: province(b), planet(d), harmony restored, pain(d) cleared.

3) Time 2 → 3: Feast (a feasts on c) — (feast a c s2 → s3)
- Preconditions: craves(a,c), province(a), harmony
  (craves(a,c) was initial; province(a) from step 1; harmony from step 2)
- Effects:
  - + pain(a)
  - + province(c)
  - - craves(a,c)
  - - province(a)
  - - harmony
  - stage advanced s2 → s3

Relevant resulting facts after step: pain(a), province(c), (craves a c removed), (harmony false).

4) Time 3 → 4: Succumb (a succumbs; province given to d) — (succumb a d s3 → s4)
- Preconditions: pain(a)
- Effects:
  - + province(d)
  - + planet(a)
  - + harmony
  - - pain(a)
  - stage advanced s3 → s4

Relevant resulting facts after step: province(d) (again), planet(a), harmony restored, pain(a) cleared.

5) Time 4 → 5: Attack (c attacks a) — (attack c a s4 → s5)
- Preconditions: province(c), planet(a), harmony
  (province(c) from step 3; planet(a) from step 4; harmony from step 4)
- Effects:
  - + pain(a)
  - - province(c)
  - - planet(a)
  - - harmony
  - stage advanced s4 → s5

Relevant resulting facts after step: pain(a) (again), province(c removed), planet(a removed), harmony false.

6) Time 5 → 6: Overcome (a overcomes d) — (overcome a d s5 → s6)
- Preconditions: province(d), pain(a)
  (province(d) from step 4; pain(a) from step 5)
- Effects:
  - + harmony
  - + province(a)
  - + craves(a,d)
  - - province(d)
  - - pain(a)
  - stage advanced s5 → s6

Relevant resulting facts after step: craves(a,d) is created (this is one of the goals), province(a) restored, province(d) removed, harmony true.

7) Time 6 → 7: Attack (a attacks d) — (attack a d s6 → s7)
- Preconditions: province(a), planet(d), harmony
  (province(a) from step 6; planet(d) from step 2; harmony from step 6)
- Effects:
  - + pain(d)
  - - province(a)
  - - planet(d)
  - - harmony
  - stage advanced s6 → s7

Relevant resulting facts after step: pain(d) (again), province(a removed), planet(d removed), harmony false. Note: craves(a,d) created in step 6 is not deleted by this attack and therefore still holds.

8) Time 7 → 8: Overcome (d overcomes b) — (overcome d b s7 → s8)
- Preconditions: province(b), pain(d)
  (province(b) from step 2; pain(d) from step 7)
- Effects:
  - + harmony
  - + province(d)
  - + craves(d,b)
  - - province(b)
  - - pain(d)
  - stage advanced s7 → s8

Relevant resulting facts after step: craves(d,b) is created (this is the other goal), province(d) restored, harmony true, pain(d) cleared.

Final verification (after time 8 / stage s8)
- Goal facts:
  - craves(a,d): True (created at step 6 and not deleted afterwards)
  - craves(d,b): True (created at step 8)

Both goal conditions are satisfied. Total cost = 8 actions (unit cost each), matching the provided plan.
