Below is a human-readable, step-by-step execution of the given plan. Each step corresponds exactly to one action in the plan, executed as an instantaneous stage transition (s0→s1, s1→s2, ...). I list the action, the agent most responsible for that action (based on the specification), the preconditions that held immediately before the action, the effects applied by the action, and the resulting important facts. All six actions are present and in the same order as the plan. Total cost: 6 (unit cost per action).

Step 1 — Time s0 → s1
- Action: Attack (agent: attacker) on province = b, planet = b
- Preconditions (at s0): province(b), planet(b), harmony
- Effects (applied at transition to s1):
  - Add: pain
  - Delete: province(b), planet(b), harmony
  - Advance current stage from s0 to s1
- Resulting notable facts after s1:
  - pain = true
  - harmony = false
  - province(b) = false, planet(b) = false
  - craves(c,a) and craves(d,c) remain unchanged from initial state

Step 2 — Time s1 → s2
- Action: Succumb (agent: succumber) with parameters prov = c, pl = a
- Preconditions (at s1): pain
- Effects (applied at transition to s2):
  - Add: harmony, province(c), planet(a)
  - Delete: pain
  - Advance current stage from s1 to s2
- Resulting notable facts after s2:
  - harmony = true
  - province(c) = true, planet(a) = true
  - pain = false
  - craves(c,a) and craves(d,c) remain (craves(c,a) still true)

Step 3 — Time s2 → s3
- Action: Feast (agent: feaster) with eater = c, prey = a
- Preconditions (at s2): craves(c,a), province(c), harmony, distinct(c,a)
- Effects (applied at transition to s3):
  - Add: pain, province(a) (idempotent if already present)
  - Delete: craves(c,a), province(c), harmony
  - Advance current stage from s2 to s3
- Resulting notable facts after s3:
  - pain = true
  - harmony = false
  - craves(c,a) = false (removed)
  - province(c) = false, province(a) = true
  - craves(d,c) still true; craves(d,a) not yet created

Step 4 — Time s3 → s4
- Action: Overcome (agent: overcomer) with subject = d, other = a
- Preconditions (at s3): province(a), pain, distinct(d,a)
- Effects (applied at transition to s4):
  - Add: harmony, province(d), craves(d,a)
  - Delete: province(a), pain
  - Advance current stage from s3 to s4
- Resulting notable facts after s4:
  - harmony = true
  - province(d) = true
  - craves(d,a) = true (this achieves the second conjunct of the final goal)
  - craves(d,c) still present (has not yet been deleted)

Step 5 — Time s4 → s5
- Action: Feast (agent: feaster) with eater = d, prey = c
- Preconditions (at s4): craves(d,c), province(d), harmony, distinct(d,c)
- Effects (applied at transition to s5):
  - Add: pain, province(c)
  - Delete: craves(d,c), province(d), harmony
  - Advance current stage from s4 to s5
- Resulting notable facts after s5:
  - pain = true
  - harmony = false
  - craves(d,c) = false (deleted)
  - province(c) = true
  - craves(d,a) remains true (from step 4)

Step 6 — Time s5 → s6
- Action: Overcome (agent: overcomer) with subject = b, other = c
- Preconditions (at s5): province(c), pain, distinct(b,c)
- Effects (applied at transition to s6):
  - Add: harmony, province(b), craves(b,c)
  - Delete: province(c), pain
  - Advance current stage from s5 to s6
- Resulting notable facts after s6:
  - harmony = true
  - craves(b,c) = true (this achieves the first conjunct of the final goal)
  - craves(d,a) = true (from step 4)
  - Final goal satisfied: craves(b,c) AND craves(d,a) are both true at s6

Conclusion
- The six listed actions (exactly those in the provided plan and in the same order) produce the required final state where:
  - craves(b,c) is true, and
  - craves(d,a) is true.
- Each action advances the discrete stage (s0→s1→...→s6) and all preconditions were satisfied when the actions were applied. Total plan cost = 6 (unit cost per action).
