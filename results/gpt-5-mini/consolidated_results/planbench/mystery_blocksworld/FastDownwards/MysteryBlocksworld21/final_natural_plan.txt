Plan execution (stages s0 → s6 correspond to time steps 0 → 6). Initial facts at time 0 (s0):
- craves(a, d)
- craves(d, c)
- harmony
- planet(b), planet(c)
- province(a), province(b)

Step 1 — time 0 → 1 (feast a on d, s0→s1)
- Action: feast(a, d)
- Preconditions checked at s0: craves(a,d), province(a), harmony, a ≠ d
- Effects at s1:
  - Added: pain(a), province(d)
  - Removed: craves(a,d), province(a), harmony
- Notes: a eats d, becomes in pain; d gains province.

Step 2 — time 1 → 2 (succumb a, s1→s2)
- Action: succumb(a)
- Preconditions checked at s1: pain(a)
- Effects at s2:
  - Added: province(a), planet(a), harmony
  - Removed: pain(a)
- Notes: a recovers (province/planet/harmony restored), pain on a cleared.

Step 3 — time 2 → 3 (feast d on c, s2→s3)
- Action: feast(d, c)
- Preconditions checked at s2: craves(d,c), province(d), harmony, d ≠ c
  (province(d) was set in Step 1; harmony was restored in Step 2)
- Effects at s3:
  - Added: pain(d), province(c)
  - Removed: craves(d,c), province(d), harmony
- Notes: d eats c, becomes in pain; c gains province.

Step 4 — time 3 → 4 (overcome d from a, s3→s4)
- Action: overcome(d, a)
- Preconditions checked at s3: pain(d), province(a), d ≠ a
  (province(a) was restored in Step 2)
- Effects at s4:
  - Added: harmony, province(d), craves(d,a)
  - Removed: pain(d), province(a)
- Notes: d overcomes a, regains province and harmony and now craves a — craves(d,a) achieved.

Step 5 — time 4 → 5 (attack b, s4→s5)
- Action: attack(b)
- Preconditions checked at s4: province(b), planet(b), harmony
  (province(b) and planet(b) were initial; harmony was set in Step 4)
- Effects at s5:
  - Added: pain(b)
  - Removed: province(b), planet(b), harmony
- Notes: b is attacked, loses province/planet/harmony and gains pain.

Step 6 — time 5 → 6 (overcome b from c, s5→s6)
- Action: overcome(b, c)
- Preconditions checked at s5: pain(b), province(c), b ≠ c
  (pain(b) from Step 5; province(c) from Step 3)
- Effects at s6:
  - Added: harmony, province(b), craves(b,c)
  - Removed: pain(b), province(c)
- Notes: b overcomes c, regains province and harmony and now craves c — craves(b,c) achieved.

Final state at time 6 (s6) includes at least:
- craves(d, a) (from Step 4)
- craves(b, c) (from Step 6)

The plan achieves the global goal: craves(b, c) and craves(d, a).
