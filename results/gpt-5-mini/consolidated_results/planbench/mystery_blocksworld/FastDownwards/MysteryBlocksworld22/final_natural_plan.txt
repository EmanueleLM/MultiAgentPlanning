Below is a step-by-step, human-readable execution of the provided PDDL plan. Each action is shown with a timestamp (unit-duration actions, starting at time 0), the parameters used, the key preconditions that must hold when the action executes, and the resulting add/remove effects on the shared facts. The stage ("at-stage sX") is advanced exactly as in the domain plan.

Initial facts (time 0, before step 1):
- craves(a,b), craves(b,d), craves(d,c)
- harmony
- planet(c)
- province(a)
- at-stage s0
- succ relations: s0→s1, s1→s2, s2→s3, s3→s4, s4→s5, s5→s6, s6→s7, s7→s8

All actions take 1 time unit. Timestamp indicates the start time; the action completes at start time + 1.

1) Time 0 → 1: feast_agent-feast(a, b, s0, s1)
- Action parameters: who = a, whom = b, stage: s0 -> s1
- Preconditions (must hold at time 0): craves(a,b), province(a), harmony, at-stage s0, succ(s0,s1)
- Effects (applied at completion time 1):
  - Adds: pain(a), province(b)
  - Removes: craves(a,b), province(a), harmony
  - Stage update: remove at-stage s0, add at-stage s1
- Short description: a "feasts" on b: a becomes in pain, b becomes a province, the craving a→b is consumed, and global harmony is broken. Stage advances from s0 to s1.

2) Time 1 → 2: succumb_agent-succumb(a, s1, s2)
- Action parameters: x = a, stage: s1 -> s2
- Preconditions (at time 1): pain(a), at-stage s1, succ(s1,s2)
- Effects (applied at completion time 2):
  - Adds: province(a), planet(a), harmony
  - Removes: pain(a)
  - Stage update: remove at-stage s1, add at-stage s2
- Short description: a "succumbs": a is restored as a province and a planet, global harmony is restored, and a’s pain is removed. Stage advances to s2.

3) Time 2 → 3: feast_agent-feast(b, d, s2, s3)
- Action parameters: who = b, whom = d, stage: s2 -> s3
- Preconditions (at time 2): craves(b,d), province(b), harmony, at-stage s2, succ(s2,s3)
  (note: province(b) was added by step 1)
- Effects (applied at completion time 3):
  - Adds: pain(b), province(d)
  - Removes: craves(b,d), province(b), harmony
  - Stage update: remove at-stage s2, add at-stage s3
- Short description: b feasts on d: b becomes in pain, d becomes a province, b→d craving is consumed, and harmony is broken. Stage advances to s3.

4) Time 3 → 4: succumb_agent-succumb(b, s3, s4)
- Action parameters: x = b, stage: s3 -> s4
- Preconditions (at time 3): pain(b), at-stage s3, succ(s3,s4)
- Effects (applied at completion time 4):
  - Adds: province(b), planet(b), harmony
  - Removes: pain(b)
  - Stage update: remove at-stage s3, add at-stage s4
- Short description: b succumbs: b regains province and planet status, harmony returns, and b’s pain is removed. Stage advances to s4.

5) Time 4 → 5: feast_agent-feast(d, c, s4, s5)
- Action parameters: who = d, whom = c, stage: s4 -> s5
- Preconditions (at time 4): craves(d,c), province(d), harmony, at-stage s4, succ(s4,s5)
  (province(d) was added in step 3)
- Effects (applied at completion time 5):
  - Adds: pain(d), province(c)
  - Removes: craves(d,c), province(d), harmony
  - Stage update: remove at-stage s4, add at-stage s5
- Short description: d feasts on c: d becomes in pain, c becomes a province, d→c craving is consumed, and harmony is broken. Stage advances to s5.

6) Time 5 → 6: overcome_agent-overcome(d, b, s5, s6)
- Action parameters: obj = d, other = b, stage: s5 -> s6
- Preconditions (at time 5): province(b), pain(d), at-stage s5, succ(s5,s6)
  (province(b) was restored in step 4; pain(d) was added in step 5)
- Effects (applied at completion time 6):
  - Adds: harmony, province(d), craves(d,b)
  - Removes: province(b), pain(d)
  - Stage update: remove at-stage s5, add at-stage s6
- Short description: d is "overcome" relative to b: harmony is restored, d becomes a province again, a new craving d→b is established, and b is no longer a province. Stage advances to s6.

7) Time 6 → 7: attack_agent-attack(c, s6, s7)
- Action parameters: x = c, stage: s6 -> s7
- Preconditions (at time 6): province(c), planet(c), harmony, at-stage s6, succ(s6,s7)
  (province(c) was added in step 5; planet(c) was present initially and has not been removed; harmony was restored in step 6)
- Effects (applied at completion time 7):
  - Adds: pain(c)
  - Removes: province(c), planet(c), harmony
  - Stage update: remove at-stage s6, add at-stage s7
- Short description: c is "attacked": c goes into pain, ceases to be a province and a planet, harmony is broken again. Stage advances to s7.

8) Time 7 → 8: overcome_agent-overcome(c, a, s7, s8)
- Action parameters: obj = c, other = a, stage: s7 -> s8
- Preconditions (at time 7): province(a), pain(c), at-stage s7, succ(s7,s8)
  (province(a) was restored in step 2; pain(c) was added in step 7)
- Effects (applied at completion time 8):
  - Adds: harmony, province(c), craves(c,a)
  - Removes: province(a), pain(c)
  - Stage update: remove at-stage s7, add at-stage s8
- Short description: c overcomes a: harmony is restored, c becomes a province again, and a new craving c→a is created; a ceases to be a province. Stage advances to s8.

Final state (after time 8):
- craves(c,a) — created at step 8 (goal fact)
- craves(d,b) — created at step 6 (goal fact)
- Other craves that started in the initial state have been consumed (a→b, b→d, d→c removed when used).
- planet facts: planet(c) was removed by step 7; other planet facts present only if added (planet(a) and planet(b) were added by succumbs at steps 2 and 4 but later province/planet removals/attacks may have changed them).
- harmony: present at the end (restored in step 8)
- at-stage s8

Goal verification:
- craves(c,a) — present after step 8
- craves(d,b) — present after step 6
Therefore, by time 8 (after completing all actions in this plan), the stated goal (craves(c,a) and craves(d,b)) is satisfied.

Notes:
- Each step follows the exact action names, parameter order, and stage transitions in the original plan.
- Each action is treated as taking one unit of time; timestamps above reflect this unit-duration scheduling (action n starts at time n-1 and ends at time n).
