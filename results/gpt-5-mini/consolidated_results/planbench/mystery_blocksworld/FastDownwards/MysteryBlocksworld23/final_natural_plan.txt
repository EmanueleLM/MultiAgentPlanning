Step 0 → 1 (duration 1 time unit)
1) Action: attack c (stage s0 → s1)
- Parameters: target = c, stage from = s0, stage to = s1
- Preconditions checked (all satisfied at start):
  - province c (true)
  - planet c (true)
  - harmony (true)
  - current stage = s0 (true)
  - s0 successor is s1 and s0 is a harmony stage (true)
- Effects applied at completion of this step:
  - Set global pain (pain becomes true)
  - Clear global harmony (harmony becomes false)
  - Remove province from c (province c becomes false)
  - Remove planet marking from c (planet c becomes false)
  - Mark c as attacked (attacked c becomes true)
  - Advance current stage: current s0 → current s1
- Immediate state highlights after step 1:
  - pain = true, harmony = false
  - province c = false; planet c = false
  - attacked c = true
  - craves still: (b craves a), (d craves b)
  - province d still true; planet a still true
  - current stage = s1

Step 1 → 2 (duration 1 time unit)
2) Action: overcome b d (stage s1 → s2)
- Parameters: initiator = b, other = d, stage from = s1, stage to = s2
- Preconditions checked (all satisfied at this time):
  - province d (true)
  - pain (true)
  - current stage = s1 (true)
  - s1 successor is s2 and s1 is a pain stage (true)
- Effects applied at completion of this step:
  - Restore global harmony (harmony becomes true)
  - Grant province to b (province b becomes true)
  - Add craving: b craves d (craves b d becomes true)
  - Remove province from d (province d becomes false)
  - Clear global pain (pain becomes false)
  - Advance current stage: current s1 → current s2
- Immediate state highlights after step 2:
  - harmony = true, pain = false
  - craves now include: (b craves a) [original], (d craves b) [original], and (b craves d) [new — goal achieved]
  - province b = true; province d = false; province c = false
  - planet a = true; planet c = false
  - attacked c = true (still set)
  - current stage = s2

Goal check (after step 2):
- Required goal (craves b d) is true. The plan achieves the goal.
