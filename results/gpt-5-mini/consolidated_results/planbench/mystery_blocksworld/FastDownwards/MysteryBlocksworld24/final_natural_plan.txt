Summary: the following 12-step sequence exactly matches the provided plan. Each step shows a timestamp (start time), an estimated duration, the action with its parameters, the required preconditions (checked against the current state), and the deterministic effects (what is added and what is removed). The state is updated cumulatively after each step. At the end I confirm the two goal predicates are satisfied.

Assume start time 00:00:00. Each step duration ≈ 10s (uniform estimate) unless noted.
