Summary of initial state (time 0)
- Current stage: s0
- Harmony: true
- Craves: c → d
- Planet: a, b, d
- Province: a, b, c
Goal to achieve: craves a → b and craves c → a

Planned execution (each action consumes the current stage and advances to the next; each step listed with timestamp and assumed duration 1 time unit)

Step 1 — t = 0 to 1 (duration: 1)
Action: attacker-attack(a, s0, s1)
- Preconditions checked: current(s0), next(s0, s1), province(a), planet(a), harmony.
- Effects applied:
  - current(s0) removed; current(s1) added.
  - pain(a) becomes true.
  - province(a) removed.
  - planet(a) removed.
  - harmony removed.
State after step 1:
- Current stage: s1
- pain(a) = true
- province: b, c
- planet: b, d
- harmony = false
- craves: c → d

Step 2 — t = 1 to 2 (duration: 1)
Action: overcomer-overcome(a, b, s1, s2)
- Preconditions checked: current(s1), next(s1, s2), province(b), pain(a).
- Effects applied:
  - current(s1) removed; current(s2) added.
  - harmony becomes true.
  - province(a) becomes true.
  - craves(a, b) becomes true.
  - province(b) removed.
  - pain(a) removed.
State after step 2:
- Current stage: s2
- harmony = true
- craves: c → d , a → b
- province: a, c
- planet: b, d (planet facts unchanged except a was already removed)

Step 3 — t = 2 to 3 (duration: 1)
Action: feaster-feast(c, d, s2, s3)
- Preconditions checked: current(s2), next(s2, s3), craves(c, d), province(c), harmony.
  (All true at this point: craves c→d was initial, province c remained true, harmony was set true in Step 2.)
- Effects applied:
  - current(s2) removed; current(s3) added.
  - pain(c) becomes true.
  - province(d) becomes true.
  - craves(c, d) removed.
  - province(c) removed.
  - harmony removed.
State after step 3:
- Current stage: s3
- pain: c = true
- province: a, d
- craves: a → b
- harmony = false

Step 4 — t = 3 to 4 (duration: 1)
Action: overcomer-overcome(c, a, s3, s4)
- Preconditions checked: current(s3), next(s3, s4), province(a), pain(c).
  (province(a) is true from Step 2; pain(c) was set true in Step 3.)
- Effects applied:
  - current(s3) removed; current(s4) added.
  - harmony becomes true.
  - province(c) becomes true.
  - craves(c, a) becomes true.
  - province(a) removed.
  - pain(c) removed.
State after step 4 (final)
- Current stage: s4
- harmony = true
- craves: a → b and c → a  ← (both goal facts achieved)
- province: c, d (a was removed; b removed earlier)
- pain: none

Outcome
- The plan finishes at t = 4 (after four actions, each 1 time unit).
- Final goal satisfied: craves(a, b) and craves(c, a) are both true.
