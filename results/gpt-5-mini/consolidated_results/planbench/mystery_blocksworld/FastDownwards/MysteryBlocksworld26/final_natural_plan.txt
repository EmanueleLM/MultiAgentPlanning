Summary: the plan executes six actions in sequence, advancing the stage from s0 → s6. Each action takes one discrete time step (t = 0→1, 1→2, …). For each step I list the action, its parameters, the stage transition (timestamp), preconditions that must hold when it starts, and the immediate add/delete effects. At the end I confirm the goal facts are satisfied.

Step 1 — Feast (feast_expert-feast a b)  
- Time: t = 0 → 1 (stage s0 → s1)  
- Parameters: eater = a, target = b  
- Preconditions required at start: craves(a,b), province(a), harmony, current(s0), next(s0,s1). All are true in the initial state.  
- Effects (applied on completion):  
  - Adds: pain, province(b), current(s1)  
  - Deletes: craves(a,b), province(a), harmony, current(s0)  
- Result after step: a no longer a province and no longer craves b; b becomes a province; pain is true; stage is s1.

Step 2 — Overcome (feast_expert-overcome d c)  
- Time: t = 1 → 2 (stage s1 → s2)  
- Parameters: x = d, other = c  
- Preconditions required at start: province(c), pain, current(s1), next(s1,s2). These are satisfied after Step 1 (province c remained true, Step 1 produced pain and set current(s1)).  
- Effects:  
  - Adds: harmony, province(d), craves(d,c), current(s2)  
  - Deletes: province(c), pain, current(s1)  
- Result after step: c is no longer a province; d becomes a province and now craves c; harmony is true; pain cleared; stage is s2.

Step 3 — Attack (attack_expert-attack b c)  
- Time: t = 2 → 3 (stage s2 → s3)  
- Parameters: prov = b, pl = c  
- Preconditions: province(b), planet(c), harmony, current(s2), next(s2,s3). These hold (b was made a province in Step 1, c was a planet initially, harmony set in Step 2).  
- Effects:  
  - Adds: pain, current(s3)  
  - Deletes: province(b), planet(c), harmony, current(s2)  
- Result after step: b loses its province marker; planet c is removed; pain becomes true; stage is s3.

Step 4 — Succumb (attack_expert-succumb a a)  
- Time: t = 3 → 4 (stage s3 → s4)  
- Parameters: prov = a, pl = a (both set to a)  
- Preconditions: pain, current(s3), next(s3,s4). Pain was set by Step 3, and current(s3) was set by Step 3.  
- Effects:  
  - Adds: province(a), planet(a), harmony, current(s4)  
  - Deletes: pain, current(s3)  
- Result after step: a regains province and planet markers and harmony is restored; pain cleared; stage is s4.

Step 5 — Attack (attack_expert-attack d a)  
- Time: t = 4 → 5 (stage s4 → s5)  
- Parameters: prov = d, pl = a  
- Preconditions: province(d), planet(a), harmony, current(s4), next(s4,s5). These hold (d became a province in Step 2; a got planet(a) and harmony in Step 4).  
- Effects:  
  - Adds: pain, current(s5)  
  - Deletes: province(d), planet(a), harmony, current(s4)  
- Result after step: d loses its province marker; a loses its planet marker; pain becomes true again; stage is s5.

Step 6 — Overcome (feast_expert-overcome c a)  
- Time: t = 5 → 6 (stage s5 → s6)  
- Parameters: x = c, other = a  
- Preconditions: province(a), pain, current(s5), next(s5,s6). These are satisfied (a was a province after Step 4 and remained a province through Step 5 until Step 5 deletes planet(a) but not province(a) — Step 5 deletes province(d) and planet(a), and province(a) remained until Step 6; pain was set by Step 5; current(s5) is true).  
- Effects:  
  - Adds: harmony, province(c), craves(c,a), current(s6)  
  - Deletes: province(a), pain, current(s5)  
- Result after step: c becomes a province and now craves a; a loses its province marker; pain cleared; stage is s6.

Final state relevant facts (after t = 6, stage s6):  
- craves(b,d) — preserved from the initial state (never deleted).  
- craves(d,c) — created in Step 2.  
- craves(c,a) — created in Step 6.  
- harmony, pain, and province/planet markers adjusted as above; current(s6) holds.

Goal check: The plan achieves the goal conjuncts (craves b d), (craves c a), and (craves d c). All three are true in the final state.

Notes on timing/duration: each action corresponds to a single stage transition and is represented here as one time unit (t = n → n+1). The plan strictly follows the given PDDL plan and stage transitions s0→s6.
