Below is a human-readable, step-by-step rendering of the given plan. Each step shows the action, the step/timestamp (sX -> sY), which preconditions it used (and that they were satisfied), the immediate add/remove effects, and the key resulting facts after the step. I report timestamps as the explicit step objects (s0…s6) used in the PDDL plan.

Initial state (before step 1)
- craves(a, d)
- craves(c, b)
- harmony
- planet(b), planet(d)
- province(a), province(c)
- current: s0

1) Step 1 — Feast(a, d)  [timestamp s0 -> s1]
- Preconditions (satisfied): craves(a,d), province(a), harmony, current s0, succ(s0,s1)
- Effects:
  - Adds: pain, province(d)
  - Removes: craves(a,d), province(a), harmony
  - Advances current: s0 removed, current becomes s1
- Key facts after step:
  - craves: (c,b)
  - pain: true
  - provinces: c, d  (a was removed, d added)
  - planets: b, d (unchanged)
  - harmony: false
  - current: s1

2) Step 2 — Succumb(a)  [timestamp s1 -> s2]
- Preconditions (satisfied): pain, current s1, succ(s1,s2)
- Effects:
  - Adds: province(a), planet(a), harmony
  - Removes: pain
  - Advances current: s1 removed, current becomes s2
- Key facts after step:
  - craves: (c,b)
  - pain: false
  - provinces: a, c, d
  - planets: a, b, d
  - harmony: true
  - current: s2

3) Step 3 — Attack(d)  [timestamp s2 -> s3]
- Preconditions (satisfied): province(d), planet(d), harmony, current s2, succ(s2,s3)
- Effects:
  - Adds: pain
  - Removes: province(d), planet(d), harmony
  - Advances current: s2 removed, current becomes s3
- Key facts after step:
  - craves: (c,b)
  - pain: true
  - provinces: a, c  (d removed)
  - planets: a, b  (d removed)
  - harmony: false
  - current: s3

4) Step 4 — Overcome(b, a)  [timestamp s3 -> s4]
- Preconditions (satisfied): province(a) (the “other”), pain, current s3, succ(s3,s4)
- Effects:
  - Adds: harmony, province(b), craves(b,a)
  - Removes: province(a), pain
  - Advances current: s3 removed, current becomes s4
- Key facts after step:
  - craves: (c,b), (b,a)
  - pain: false
  - provinces: b, c  (a removed, b added)
  - planets: a, b
  - harmony: true
  - current: s4

5) Step 5 — Attack(b)  [timestamp s4 -> s5]
- Preconditions (satisfied): province(b), planet(b), harmony, current s4, succ(s4,s5)
- Effects:
  - Adds: pain
  - Removes: province(b), planet(b), harmony
  - Advances current: s4 removed, current becomes s5
- Key facts after step:
  - craves: (c,b), (b,a)
  - pain: true
  - provinces: c  (b removed)
  - planets: a  (b removed)
  - harmony: false
  - current: s5

6) Step 6 — Overcome(d, c)  [timestamp s5 -> s6]
- Preconditions (satisfied): province(c) (the “other”), pain, current s5, succ(s5,s6)
- Effects:
  - Adds: harmony, province(d), craves(d,c)
  - Removes: province(c), pain
  - Advances current: s5 removed, current becomes s6
- Key facts after step (final state):
  - craves: (c,b), (b,a), (d,c)
  - pain: false
  - provinces: d  (c removed, d added) — note a and b are not provinces now
  - planets: a
  - harmony: true
  - current: s6

Goal check (final state)
- craves(b, a): present
- craves(c, b): present
- craves(d, c): present

All three goal predicates are satisfied in the final state. The sequence of six actions (feast, succumb, attack, overcome, attack, overcome) with timestamps s0->s6 matches the provided plan exactly and reaches the specified goal.
