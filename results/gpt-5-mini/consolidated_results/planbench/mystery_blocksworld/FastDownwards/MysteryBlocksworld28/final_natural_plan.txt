1) Time s0 → s1 (step 0 → 1, duration 1)
Action: feast(d, b)
Agent: feaster
Preconditions (at s0): d craves b, province(d), harmony — all true in the initial state.
Effect (applied at s1):
- Removed: the relation "d craves b", province(d), harmony.
- Added: pain(d), province(b).
Resulting note: d has just feasted on b, becoming "in pain"; b becomes a province.

2) Time s1 → s2 (step 1 → 2, duration 1)
Action: overcome(d, c)
Agent: attacker
Preconditions (at s1): province(c) and pain(d) — satisfied after step 1 (province(c) was initially true; step 1 created pain(d)).
Effect (applied at s2):
- Removed: province(c), pain(d).
- Added: harmony, province(d), craves(d, c).
Resulting note: d is now a province again and now craves c; harmony is restored.

3) Time s2 → s3 (step 2 → 3, duration 1)
Action: feast(b, a)
Agent: feaster
Preconditions (at s2): b craves a, province(b), harmony — all satisfied (b craves a was in the initial state; province(b) was added in step 1; harmony was restored in step 2).
Effect (applied at s3):
- Removed: the relation "b craves a", province(b), harmony.
- Added: pain(b), province(a).
Resulting note: b has feasted on a and is now in pain; a becomes a province.

4) Time s3 → s4 (step 3 → 4, duration 1)
Action: overcome(b, d)
Agent: attacker
Preconditions (at s3): province(d) and pain(b) — satisfied after step 2 (province(d) was added) and step 3 (pain(b) was added).
Effect (applied at s4):
- Removed: province(d), pain(b).
- Added: harmony, province(b), craves(b, d).
Resulting note: b is again a province and now craves d; harmony is restored.

Final state at s4 (after these four unit-cost steps):
- craves(b, d) is true (established in step 4)
- craves(d, c) is true (established in step 2)
Goal achieved: both "b craves d" and "d craves c" hold.
