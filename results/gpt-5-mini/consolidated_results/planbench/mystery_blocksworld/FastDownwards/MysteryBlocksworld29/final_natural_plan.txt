Step 1 — Feast(b, d) — stage s0 → s1 (time 0 → 1)
- Action: Feast on objects b (actor) and d (target).
- Required/checked preconditions at s0:
  - now s0 (we are at stage s0)
  - next(s0, s1) (s0 advances to s1)
  - craves(b, d) — present in the initial state
  - province(b) — present in the initial state
  - harmony — present in the initial state
- Effects (applied on the transition s0 → s1):
  - Added: pain(b), province(d)
  - Deleted: craves(b, d), province(b), harmony
  - Time token: now(s0) removed, now(s1) added (advance to next stage)
- State summary immediately after Step 1 (relevant facts):
  - craves(a, c) — unchanged, still true
  - craves(b, d) — removed by Feast
  - pain(b) — now true
  - province(d) — now true
  - province(b) — removed
  - harmony — removed
  - now(s1) — current stage

Step 2 — Overcome(b, a) — stage s1 → s2 (time 1 → 2)
- Action: Overcome with actor b targeting other object a.
- Required/checked preconditions at s1:
  - now s1 (we are at stage s1)
  - next(s1, s2) (s1 advances to s2)
  - province(a) — present from the initial state and not affected by Step 1
  - pain(b) — produced by Step 1
- Effects (applied on the transition s1 → s2):
  - Added: harmony, province(b), craves(b, a)
  - Deleted: province(a), pain(b)
  - Time token: now(s1) removed, now(s2) added (advance to next stage)
- State summary immediately after Step 2 (relevant facts):
  - craves(a, c) — still true (carried from the initial state)
  - craves(b, a) — now true (added by Overcome)
  - province(a) — removed by Overcome
  - province(b) — re-added by Overcome
  - harmony — restored by Overcome
  - pain(b) — removed
  - now(s2) — current stage

Final check (after both steps)
- Goal required: craves(a, c) AND craves(b, a)
- Achieved: craves(a, c) is still true; craves(b, a) was added in Step 2.
- Therefore the provided two-step plan (Feast(b,d) at s0→s1; Overcome(b,a) at s1→s2) satisfies the goal.
