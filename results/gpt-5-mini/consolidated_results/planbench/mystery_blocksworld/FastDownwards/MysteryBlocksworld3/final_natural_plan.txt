Initial state (before any action, current-stage = t0):
- craves(b, a)
- craves(c, b)
- harmony
- planet(a), planet(d)
- province(c), province(d)
- current-stage t0
- succ links: t0→t1, t1→t2, t2→t3

Plan (2 steps, cost = 2)

1) Time / stage: transition t0 → t1
Action: Attack d (attack d t0 t1)
- Preconditions checked at t0:
  - province(d) — true
  - planet(d) — true
  - harmony — true
  - current-stage = t0 and succ(t0,t1) — true
- Effects applied (immediately after the action; current-stage becomes t1):
  - Added: pain(d)
  - Deleted: province(d), planet(d), harmony
  - Current stage: t0 removed, current-stage set to t1
- State after step 1 (at stage t1):
  - craves(b,a) (unchanged)
  - craves(c,b) (unchanged)
  - pain(d)
  - planet(a) (unchanged)
  - province(c) (unchanged)
  - province(d) removed
  - planet(d) removed
  - harmony removed
  - current-stage = t1

2) Time / stage: transition t1 → t2
Action: Overcome d over c (overcome d c t1 t2)
- Preconditions checked at t1:
  - province(c) — true (left over from initial state)
  - pain(d) — true (created by Attack)
  - current-stage = t1 and succ(t1,t2) — true
- Effects applied (immediately after the action; current-stage becomes t2):
  - Added: harmony, province(d), craves(d,c)
  - Deleted: province(c), pain(d)
  - Current stage: t1 removed, current-stage set to t2
- State after step 2 (at stage t2):
  - craves(b,a) — still true (never deleted)
  - craves(d,c) — newly true (goal conjunct added)
  - harmony — restored
  - province(d) — restored
  - province(c) — removed
  - pain(d) — removed
  - planet(a) — still true

Goal check (after step 2):
- craves(b,a) — true
- craves(d,c) — true
=> Goal satisfied.

Notes:
- Each action advances the current-stage timestamp as specified (t0→t1, then t1→t2).
- No other actions are added or removed; the two actions above exactly follow the provided plan.
