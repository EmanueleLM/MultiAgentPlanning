Below is a clear, step-by-step, human-readable execution of the given plan. Each step corresponds exactly to one action from the plan, uses the same parameters and stage transition, and reports the preconditions that are checked and the effects that are applied. Each step advances time by one stage (sN → sN+1), i.e. duration = 1 time unit.

Step 1
Action: feast d a (from s0 to s1)
Preconditions checked: (craves d a), (province d), (harmony), (at s0), (succ s0 s1)
Effects (applied):
- Added: (pain d), (province a)
- Removed: (craves d a), (province d), (harmony)
- Time: (at s0) removed, (at s1) added

Step 2
Action: succumb d (from s1 to s2)
Preconditions checked: (pain d), (at s1), (succ s1 s2)
Effects (applied):
- Added: (province d), (planet d), (harmony)
- Removed: (pain d)
- Time: (at s1) removed, (at s2) added

Step 3
Action: feast a c (from s2 to s3)
Preconditions checked: (craves a c), (province a), (harmony), (at s2), (succ s2 s3)
Effects (applied):
- Added: (pain a), (province c)
- Removed: (craves a c), (province a), (harmony)
- Time: (at s2) removed, (at s3) added

Step 4
Action: succumb a (from s3 to s4)
Preconditions checked: (pain a), (at s3), (succ s3 s4)
Effects (applied):
- Added: (province a), (planet a), (harmony)
- Removed: (pain a)
- Time: (at s3) removed, (at s4) added

Step 5
Action: feast c b (from s4 to s5)
Preconditions checked: (craves c b), (province c), (harmony), (at s4), (succ s4 s5)
Effects (applied):
- Added: (pain c), (province b)
- Removed: (craves c b), (province c), (harmony)
- Time: (at s4) removed, (at s5) added

Step 6
Action: succumb c (from s5 to s6)
Preconditions checked: (pain c), (at s5), (succ s5 s6)
Effects (applied):
- Added: (province c), (planet c), (harmony)
- Removed: (pain c)
- Time: (at s5) removed, (at s6) added

Step 7
Action: attack a (from s6 to s7)
Preconditions checked: (province a), (planet a), (harmony), (at s6), (succ s6 s7)
Effects (applied):
- Added: (pain a)
- Removed: (province a), (planet a), (harmony)
- Time: (at s6) removed, (at s7) added

Step 8
Action: overcome a b (from s7 to s8)
Preconditions checked: (province b), (pain a), (at s7), (succ s7 s8)
Effects (applied):
- Added: (harmony), (province a), (craves a b)
- Removed: (province b), (pain a)
- Time: (at s7) removed, (at s8) added
Note: After this step (craves a b) becomes true — this satisfies the first conjunct of the final goal.

Step 9
Action: attack d (from s8 to s9)
Preconditions checked: (province d), (planet d), (harmony), (at s8), (succ s8 s9)
Effects (applied):
- Added: (pain d)
- Removed: (province d), (planet d), (harmony)
- Time: (at s8) removed, (at s9) added

Step 10
Action: overcome d c (from s9 to s10)
Preconditions checked: (province c), (pain d), (at s9), (succ s9 s10)
Effects (applied):
- Added: (harmony), (province d), (craves d c)
- Removed: (province c), (pain d)
- Time: (at s9) removed, (at s10) added
Note: After this step (craves d c) becomes true — this satisfies the second conjunct of the final goal.

Summary / Final state highlights (after s10)
- Goal achieved: (craves a b) is true and (craves d c) is true.
- Time has advanced from s0 to s10 through the listed stage transitions.
- Total plan cost (unit cost per action): 10.

This sequence follows the provided plan exactly, each action advancing the stage by one and applying the preconditions/effects as defined in the domain.
