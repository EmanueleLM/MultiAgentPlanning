Initial state (time t=0):
- current-phase: p1
- harmony: true
- province: a
- planet: c
- craves: (a d), (b c), (d b)

Plan (each action has unit duration = 1 time unit):

Step 1 — Time t=0 → t=1
- Action: feeder-feast a d (performed by feeder), phase p1 → p2
- Preconditions checked at t=0:
  - current-phase p1 (and p1 has successor p2)
  - craves(a, d)
  - province(a)
  - harmony = true
- Effects applied at t=1:
  - Add: pain = true
  - Add: province(d) = true
  - Delete: craves(a, d)
  - Delete: province(a)
  - Delete: harmony = false
  - Advance phase: current-phase becomes p2 (remove current-phase p1)
- Key facts after step 1 (t=1):
  - current-phase: p2
  - pain: true
  - province: d (a no longer a province)
  - craves: (b c), (d b)  (a→d removed)
  - harmony: false

Step 2 — Time t=1 → t=2
- Action: overcomer-overcome b d (performed by overcomer), phase p2 → p3
- Preconditions checked at t=1:
  - current-phase p2 (and p2 has successor p3)
  - province(d) = true
  - pain = true
- Effects applied at t=2:
  - Add: harmony = true
  - Add: province(b) = true
  - Add: craves(b, d)
  - Delete: province(d)
  - Delete: pain (pain = false)
  - Advance phase: current-phase becomes p3 (remove current-phase p2)
- Key facts after step 2 (t=2):
  - current-phase: p3
  - harmony: true
  - pain: false
  - province: b (d no longer a province)
  - craves: (b c), (d b), (b d)

Step 3 — Time t=2 → t=3
- Action: feeder-feast b c (performed by feeder), phase p3 → p4
- Preconditions checked at t=2:
  - current-phase p3 (and p3 has successor p4)
  - craves(b, c)  (this was present from the initial state and was not removed)
  - province(b) = true
  - harmony = true
- Effects applied at t=3:
  - Add: pain = true
  - Add: province(c) = true
  - Delete: craves(b, c)
  - Delete: province(b)
  - Delete: harmony = false
  - Advance phase: current-phase becomes p4 (remove current-phase p3)
- Key facts after step 3 (t=3):
  - current-phase: p4
  - pain: true
  - harmony: false
  - province: c (b no longer a province)
  - craves: (d b), (b d)  (b→c removed)

Step 4 — Time t=3 → t=4
- Action: overcomer-overcome a c (performed by overcomer), phase p4 → p5
- Preconditions checked at t=3:
  - current-phase p4 (and p4 has successor p5)
  - province(c) = true
  - pain = true
- Effects applied at t=4:
  - Add: harmony = true
  - Add: province(a) = true
  - Add: craves(a, c)
  - Delete: province(c)
  - Delete: pain (pain = false)
  - Advance phase: current-phase becomes p5 (remove current-phase p4)
- Key facts after step 4 (t=4):
  - current-phase: p5
  - harmony: true
  - pain: false
  - province: a (c no longer a province)
  - craves: (d b), (b d), (b d) (unchanged duplicates kept logical only once), (a c) — goal achieved

Goal check (t=4):
- craves(a, c) is true — goal satisfied.

Notes:
- Each step corresponds exactly to one action in the provided plan and advances the phase by one successor (p1→p2→p3→p4→p5).
- Each action was given unit duration; timestamps reflect discrete successive execution (t=0..4).
- The sequence is consistent with the domain effects and the initial facts and achieves the specified goal.
