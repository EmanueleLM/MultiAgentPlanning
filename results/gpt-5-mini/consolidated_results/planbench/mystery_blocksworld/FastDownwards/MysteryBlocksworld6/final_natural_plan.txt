Summary: the following 6-step, unit-cost plan executes the actions in the given order. Each step lists the action instance, its required preconditions (and whether they are satisfied at that moment), the effects that are applied, an estimated timestamp (one-second increments for readability), and the immediate state change. After step 4 and step 6 the two goals are reached.

Step 1 — t = 0s
Action: act_clip(object_9, object_4, object_6)
Meaning (schema clip): requires (hand ?x), (sneeze ?y), (texture ?z), (next ?y ?z), (next ?x ?z). Effects: add (vase ?x ?y), delete (next ?x ?z).
Preconditions at this time:
- hand object_9 — satisfied
- sneeze object_4 — satisfied
- texture object_6 — satisfied
- next object_4 object_6 — satisfied
- next object_9 object_6 — satisfied
Effects applied:
- Added: (vase object_9 object_4)
- Deleted: (next object_9 object_6)
State note: object_9 no longer points to object_6; a vase relation between object_9 and object_4 is created.

Step 2 — t = 1s
Action: act_wretched(object_4, object_8, object_9, object_3)
Meaning (schema wretched): requires (sneeze ?x), (texture ?y), (texture ?z), (stupendous ?w), (next ?x ?y), (collect ?y ?w), (collect ?z ?w). Effects: add (next ?x ?z), delete (next ?x ?y).
Preconditions at this time:
- sneeze object_4 — satisfied
- texture object_8 — satisfied
- texture object_9 — satisfied
- stupendous object_3 — satisfied
- next object_4 object_8 — satisfied
- collect object_8 object_3 — satisfied
- collect object_9 object_3 — satisfied
Effects applied:
- Added: (next object_4 object_9)
- Deleted: (next object_4 object_8)
State note: object_4’s successor changed from object_8 to object_9.

Step 3 — t = 2s
Action: act_clip(object_10, object_4, object_9)
Meaning (schema clip): same as Step 1.
Preconditions at this time:
- hand object_10 — satisfied
- sneeze object_4 — satisfied
- texture object_9 — satisfied
- next object_4 object_9 — satisfied (added in Step 2)
- next object_10 object_9 — satisfied (initial)
Effects applied:
- Added: (vase object_10 object_4)
- Deleted: (next object_10 object_9)
State note: object_10 no longer points to object_9; a vase relation between object_10 and object_4 is created.

Step 4 — t = 3s
Action: act_tightfisted(object_10, object_4, object_6)
Meaning (schema tightfisted): requires (hand ?x), (sneeze ?y), (texture ?z), (next ?y ?z), (vase ?x ?y). Effects: add (next ?x ?z), delete (vase ?x ?y).
Preconditions at this time:
- hand object_10 — satisfied
- sneeze object_4 — satisfied
- texture object_6 — satisfied
- next object_4 object_6 — satisfied (present from initial state; not deleted earlier)
- vase object_10 object_4 — satisfied (added in Step 3)
Effects applied:
- Added: (next object_10 object_6)
- Deleted: (vase object_10 object_4)
State note: object_10 now points to object_6.
Goal check: (next object_10 object_6) — ACHIEVED at this step.

Step 5 — t = 4s
Action: act_wretched(object_4, object_6, object_7, object_2)
Meaning (schema wretched): same as Step 2.
Preconditions at this time:
- sneeze object_4 — satisfied
- texture object_6 — satisfied
- texture object_7 — satisfied
- stupendous object_2 — satisfied
- next object_4 object_6 — satisfied (was present initially and not deleted until this step)
- collect object_6 object_2 — satisfied (initial)
- collect object_7 object_2 — satisfied (initial)
Effects applied:
- Added: (next object_4 object_7)
- Deleted: (next object_4 object_6)
State note: object_4’s successor changed from object_6 to object_7.

Step 6 — t = 5s
Action: act_tightfisted(object_9, object_4, object_7)
Meaning (schema tightfisted): same as Step 4.
Preconditions at this time:
- hand object_9 — satisfied
- sneeze object_4 — satisfied
- texture object_7 — satisfied
- next object_4 object_7 — satisfied (added in Step 5)
- vase object_9 object_4 — satisfied (added in Step 1 and not deleted until now)
Effects applied:
- Added: (next object_9 object_7)
- Deleted: (vase object_9 object_4)
State note: object_9 now points to object_7.
Goal check: (next object_9 object_7) — ACHIEVED at this step.

Final assessment
- Both required goals are achieved by this sequence:
  - next object_10 object_6 achieved at Step 4
  - next object_9 object_7 achieved at Step 6
- All preconditions for each step are satisfied at the time the step is executed (checked against the initial state and the intermediate effects of prior steps).
- Plan cost: 6 (unit-cost actions).
- No extra actions were added or removed; the plan follows the provided action sequence exactly.
