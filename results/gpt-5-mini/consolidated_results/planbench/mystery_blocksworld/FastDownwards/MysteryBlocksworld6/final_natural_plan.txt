Below is a clear, step-by-step, human-readable trace of the given plan. Each step matches the plan actions exactly and reports the stage timestamp (the current stage advanced by the action). For each step I list the main preconditions that must hold when the action executes and the primary positive and negative effects produced.

Step 1
- Action: feaster_feast b c
- Timestamp: executes at stage s0 → s1
- Preconditions (at s0): current s0, succ s0 s1, craves(b,c), province(b), harmony, different(b,c)
- Effects (applied when moving to s1):
  - Adds: pain(b), province(c)
  - Deletes: craves(b,c), province(b), harmony
- Resulting notable facts after s1: pain(b) and province(c) hold; craves(b,c), province(b), harmony no longer hold.

Step 2
- Action: overcomer_overcome b d
- Timestamp: executes at stage s1 → s2
- Preconditions (at s1): current s1, succ s1 s2, province(d), pain(b), different(b,d)
- Effects (applied when moving to s2):
  - Adds: harmony, province(b), craves(b,d)
  - Deletes: province(d), pain(b)
- Resulting notable facts after s2: harmony, province(b), craves(b,d) hold; province(d) and pain(b) removed.

Step 3
- Action: feaster_feast b d
- Timestamp: executes at stage s2 → s3
- Preconditions (at s2): current s2, succ s2 s3, craves(b,d), province(b), harmony, different(b,d)
- Effects (applied when moving to s3):
  - Adds: pain(b), province(d)
  - Deletes: craves(b,d), province(b), harmony
- Resulting notable facts after s3: pain(b), province(d) hold; craves(b,d), province(b), harmony removed.

Step 4
- Action: succumb_succumb b
- Timestamp: executes at stage s3 → s4
- Preconditions (at s3): current s3, succ s3 s4, pain(b)
- Effects (applied when moving to s4):
  - Adds: province(b), planet(b), harmony
  - Deletes: pain(b)
- Resulting notable facts after s4: province(b), planet(b), harmony hold; pain(b) removed.

Step 5
- Action: attacker_attack d
- Timestamp: executes at stage s4 → s5
- Preconditions (at s4): current s4, succ s4 s5, province(d), planet(d), harmony
- Effects (applied when moving to s5):
  - Adds: pain(d)
  - Deletes: province(d), planet(d), harmony
- Resulting notable facts after s5: pain(d) holds; province(d), planet(d), harmony removed.

Step 6
- Action: overcomer_overcome d c
- Timestamp: executes at stage s5 → s6
- Preconditions (at s5): current s5, succ s5 s6, province(c), pain(d), different(d,c)
- Effects (applied when moving to s6):
  - Adds: harmony, province(d), craves(d,c)
  - Deletes: province(c), pain(d)
- Resulting notable facts after s6: harmony, province(d), craves(d,c) hold; province(c) and pain(d) removed.

Step 7
- Action: attacker_attack b
- Timestamp: executes at stage s6 → s7
- Preconditions (at s6): current s6, succ s6 s7, province(b), planet(b), harmony
- Effects (applied when moving to s7):
  - Adds: pain(b)
  - Deletes: province(b), planet(b), harmony
- Resulting notable facts after s7: pain(b) holds; province(b), planet(b), harmony removed.

Step 8
- Action: overcomer_overcome b d
- Timestamp: executes at stage s7 → s8
- Preconditions (at s7): current s7, succ s7 s8, province(d), pain(b), different(b,d)
- Effects (applied when moving to s8):
  - Adds: harmony, province(b), craves(b,d)
  - Deletes: province(d), pain(b)
- Resulting notable facts after s8: harmony, province(b), craves(b,d) hold; province(d) and pain(b) removed.

Step 9
- Action: attacker_attack a
- Timestamp: executes at stage s8 → s9
- Preconditions (at s8): current s8, succ s8 s9, province(a), planet(a), harmony
- Effects (applied when moving to s9):
  - Adds: pain(a)
  - Deletes: province(a), planet(a), harmony
- Resulting notable facts after s9: pain(a) holds; province(a), planet(a), harmony removed.

Step 10
- Action: overcomer_overcome a b
- Timestamp: executes at stage s9 → s10
- Preconditions (at s9): current s9, succ s9 s10, province(b), pain(a), different(a,b)
- Effects (applied when moving to s10):
  - Adds: harmony, province(a), craves(a,b)
  - Deletes: province(b), pain(a)
- Resulting notable facts after s10: harmony, province(a), craves(a,b) hold; province(b) and pain(a) removed.

Goal check (after step 10 / at s10)
- Craving goals achieved:
  - craves(a,b) — created at Step 10
  - craves(b,d) — created at Step 8
  - craves(d,c) — created at Step 6

The above sequence follows the provided plan exactly, shows the stage-based timestamps s0→s10, lists the main preconditions and the positive/negative effects for each action, and shows that the final goal (craves a b, craves b d, craves d c) is satisfied at the end.
