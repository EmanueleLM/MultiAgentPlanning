Summary: Each action executes in one discrete step, consuming step sN and producing sN+1 as current. I list each action in order, with its step (sN -> sN+1) treated as a timestamp (time N → N+1), the preconditions that are checked at that time, and the effects applied immediately after.

1) Time s1 → s2 (step 1): feast c d
- Actor / objects: subject = c, other = d
- Preconditions checked: (craves c d), (province c), (harmony), (step-current s1) & (step-next s1 s2)
- Effects applied:
  - Added: (pain c), (province d)
  - Removed: (craves c d), (province c), (harmony)
  - Step advancement: s1 consumed, s2 becomes current

2) Time s2 → s3 (step 2): succumb c
- Actor / objects: subject = c
- Preconditions checked: (pain c), (step-current s2) & (step-next s2 s3)
- Effects applied:
  - Added: (province c), (planet c), (harmony)
  - Removed: (pain c)
  - Step advancement: s2 consumed, s3 becomes current

3) Time s3 → s4 (step 3): feast d a
- Actor / objects: subject = d, other = a
- Preconditions checked: (craves d a), (province d), (harmony), (step-current s3) & (step-next s3 s4)
  (province d was established by step 1)
- Effects applied:
  - Added: (pain d), (province a)
  - Removed: (craves d a), (province d), (harmony)
  - Step advancement: s3 consumed, s4 becomes current

4) Time s4 → s5 (step 4): overcome d b
- Actor / objects: subject = d, other = b

- Effects applied:
  - Added: (harmony), (province d), (craves d b)
  - Removed: (province b), (pain d)
  - Step advancement: s4 consumed, s5 becomes current

5) Time s5 → s6 (step 5): attack a
- Actor / objects: subject = a
- Preconditions checked: (province a), (planet a), (harmony), (step-current s5) & (step-next s5 s6)
  (province a was set in step 3; planet a was present initially)
- Effects applied:
  - Added: (pain a)
  - Removed: (province a), (planet a), (harmony)
  - Step advancement: s5 consumed, s6 becomes current

6) Time s6 → s7 (step 6): overcome a c
- Actor / objects: subject = a, other = c
- Preconditions checked: (pain a), (province c), (step-current s6) & (step-next s6 s7)
  (province c restored in step 2)
- Effects applied:
  - Added: (harmony), (province a), (craves a c)
  - Removed: (province c), (pain a)
  - Step advancement: s6 consumed, s7 becomes current

7) Time s7 → s8 (step 7): feast d b
- Actor / objects: subject = d, other = b
- Preconditions checked: (craves d b), (province d), (harmony), (step-current s7) & (step-next s7 s8)
  (craves d b set in step 4; province d set in step 4)
- Effects applied:
  - Added: (pain d), (province b)
  - Removed: (craves d b), (province d), (harmony)
  - Step advancement: s7 consumed, s8 becomes current

8) Time s8 → s9 (step 8): succumb d
- Actor / objects: subject = d
- Preconditions checked: (pain d), (step-current s8) & (step-next s8 s9)
- Effects applied:
  - Added: (province d), (planet d), (harmony)
  - Removed: (pain d)
  - Step advancement: s8 consumed, s9 becomes current

9) Time s9 → s10 (step 9): attack b
- Actor / objects: subject = b
- Preconditions checked: (province b), (planet b), (harmony), (step-current s9) & (step-next s9 s10)
  (province b set in step 7; planet b present initially)
- Effects applied:
  - Added: (pain b)
  - Removed: (province b), (planet b), (harmony)
  - Step advancement: s9 consumed, s10 becomes current

10) Time s10 → s11 (step 10): overcome b a
- Actor / objects: subject = b, other = a
- Preconditions checked: (pain b), (province a), (step-current s10) & (step-next s10 s11)
  (province a set in step 3 and later changed; at this moment province a is present from step 6)
- Effects applied:
  - Added: (harmony), (province b), (craves b a)
  - Removed: (province a), (pain b)
  - Step advancement: s10 consumed, s11 becomes current

11) Time s11 → s12 (step 11): attack d
- Actor / objects: subject = d
- Preconditions checked: (province d), (planet d), (harmony), (step-current s11) & (step-next s11 s12)
  (province & planet d were restored in step 8; harmony set in step 10)
- Effects applied:
  - Added: (pain d)
  - Removed: (province d), (planet d), (harmony)
  - Step advancement: s11 consumed, s12 becomes current

12) Time s12 → s13 (step 12): overcome d b
- Actor / objects: subject = d, other = b
- Preconditions checked: (pain d), (province b), (step-current s12) & (step-next s12 s13)
  (pain d was set in step 11; province b set in step 10)
- Effects applied:
  - Added: (harmony), (province d), (craves d b)
  - Removed: (province b), (pain d)
  - Step advancement: s12 consumed, s13 becomes current

Final state (after step 12)
- Goal satisfied: (craves a c) — created at step 6; (craves b a) — created at step 10; (craves d b) — created at step 12.
- Total actions executed: 12
- Total (unit) cost reported: 12

Notes:
- Each action above corresponds exactly to one plan line and consumes one discrete step (sN → sN+1).
- Preconditions and effects listed follow the domain semantics: feast consumes craves/province/harmony and yields pain + other's province; succumb restores province/planet/harmony and removes pain; attack requires province+planet+harmony and yields pain while removing province/planet/harmony; overcome requires pain + other's province and yields harmony + subject's province + craves(subject, other) while removing other's province and subject's pain.
