Summary of initial situation (time 0)
- Objects: a, b, c, d.
- True facts:
  - craves(a, d)
  - craves(b, c)
  - harmony
  - planet(c)
  - planet(d)
  - province(a)
  - province(b)
- Current stage: s0
- Goal to achieve: craves(b, d) AND craves(d, a)

Plan (4 steps, each step advances the stage by one; assume each action takes 1 time unit)

Step 1 — Time 0 → 1
Action: feast(b, c) (parameters: src = b, tgt = c; stage s0 → s1)
- Preconditions (satisfied at time 0): b craves c, province(b), harmony, current stage is s0 and next(s0,s1).
- Effects applied at time 1:
  - Added: pain, province(c)
  - Deleted: craves(b,c), province(b), harmony
  - Stage advance: current s0 → current s1
Notes: After this step, craves(b,c) is removed; province(c) is created; pain is true; harmony is false.

Step 2 — Time 1 → 2
Action: overcome(d, a) (parameters: obj = d, other = a; stage s1 → s2)
- Preconditions (satisfied at time 1): province(a) and pain are both true; current stage is s1 and next(s1,s2).
- Effects applied at time 2:
  - Added: harmony, province(d), craves(d, a)
  - Deleted: province(a), pain
  - Stage advance: current s1 → current s2
Notes: This creates craves(d,a) (part of the final goal) and restores harmony.

Step 3 — Time 2 → 3
Action: attack(c, c) (parameters: prov = c, pl = c; stage s2 → s3)
- Preconditions (satisfied at time 2): province(c), planet(c), harmony, current stage is s2 and next(s2,s3).
- Effects applied at time 3:
  - Added: pain, attacked(c, c)
  - Deleted: province(c), planet(c), harmony
  - Stage advance: current s2 → current s3
Notes: This consumes province(c) and planet(c), and makes pain true again.

Step 4 — Time 3 → 4
Action: overcome(b, d) (parameters: obj = b, other = d; stage s3 → s4)
- Preconditions (satisfied at time 3): province(d) and pain are true; current stage is s3 and next(s3,s4).
- Effects applied at time 4:
  - Added: harmony, province(b), craves(b, d)
  - Deleted: province(d), pain
  - Stage advance: current s3 → current s4
Notes: This step creates craves(b,d), which is the other part of the final goal.

Final verification (time 4)
- craves(b, d): true (created at Step 4)
- craves(d, a): true (created at Step 2)
=> Goal satisfied.

Plan cost: 4 (4 unit-cost actions).
