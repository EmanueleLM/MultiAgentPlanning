Are predicates parameterized by object names? e.g.\n   - Province a means Province(a) (true for object a) rather than a global \u201cthere is a province\u201d flag?\n   - Planet d means Planet(d), Object Craves a b means Craves(a,b), Pain object means Pain(x)?

And effects \u201cObject Craves other object\u201d means Craves(X,Y)?\n   - Feast X from Y: preconditions Object Craves other object, Province object, Harmony \u2014 do you mean Craves(X,Y), Province(X), Harmony?

    "response": "Short answer: The goal is unreachable from the given initial state and action definitions.\n\nWhy (concise proof):\n\n- The only way to create a \"X craves Y\" fact is the Overcome X from Y action (it is the only action whose add-effects include an Object Craves other object).\n- To obtain Craves(c,d) we therefore must do Overcome c from d. That action requires Province(d) and Pain at the same time.\n- Initially Province(d) is true and Pain is false. So we must create Pain while Province(d) remains true.\n- What produces Pain?\n  - Attack object produces Pain, but Attack requires Province(object) and Planet(object) and Harmony. Planet(d) is false in the initial state, and Attack deletes Province(object) when performed (so it would remove Province(d) if we attacked d).\n  - Feast object from another object produces Pain, but to produce Pain without touching Province(d) we would need to Feast some object X where Province(X) is true and X \u2260 d. Initially the only Province present is d, so the only feasible Feast that can be done first is Feast d from b \u2014 and that action deletes Province(d) (it makes Province(other) and removes Province(d) and Harmony).\n  - Succumb requires Pain as a precondition, so it cannot create the first Pain.\n- Therefore every action that can first create Pain from the initial state either:\n  - requires Province(d) but then deletes Province(d) (Feast d from b), or\n  - cannot be applied (Attack d requires Planet(d), absent), or\n  - requires Pain already (Succumb).\n- So it is impossible to have both Pain and Province(d) simultaneously at any reachable state from the initial state. Thus Overcome c from d can never be applied, so Craves(c,d) can never be created. Since Craves(c,d) is part of the goal, the goal is unreachable.\n\nIf you want, I can:\n- produce a formal state-space search attempt that demonstrates no solution, or\n- suggest minimal changes to the domain or initial facts that would make the goal reachable (for example, adding Province(c) initially, or making Planet(d) true initially, or adding another object with an initial Province so you can generate Pain without destroying Province(d))."
