PROBLEM
------------------------------
I am playing with a set of objects. Here are the actions I can do

Paltry object_0 object_1 object_2.
Sip object_0 object_1 object_2.
Clip object_0 object_1 object_2.
Wretched object_0 object_1 object_2 object_3.
Memory object_0 object_1 object_2.
Tightfisted object_0 object_1 object_2.

I have the following restrictions on my actions:
To perform paltry action, the following facts need to be true: hand object_0, cats object_1, texture object_2, vase object_0 object_1, and next object_1 object_2
Once paltry is performed the following facts will be true: next object_0 object_2
Once paltry is performed the following facts will be false: vase object_0 object_1
To perform sip action, the following facts need to be true: hand object_0, cats object_1, texture object_2, next object_0 object_2, and next object_1 object_2
Once sip is performed the following facts will be true: vase object_0 object_1
Once sip is performed the following facts will be false: next object_0 object_2
To perform clip action, the following facts need to be true: hand object_0, sneeze object_1, texture object_2, next object_1 object_2, and next object_0 object_2
Once clip is performed the following facts will be true: vase object_0 object_1
Once clip is performed the following facts will be false: next object_0 object_2
To perform wretched action, the following facts need to be true: sneeze object_0, texture object_1, texture object_2, stupendous object_3, next object_0 object_1, collect object_1 object_3, and collect object_2 object_3
Once wretched is performed the following facts will be true: next object_0 object_2
Once wretched is performed the following facts will be false: next object_0 object_1
To perform memory action, the following facts need to be true: cats object_0, spring object_1, spring object_2, and next object_0 object_1
Once memory is performed the following facts will be true: next object_0 object_2
Once memory is performed the following facts will be false: next object_0 object_1
To perform tightfisted action, the following facts need to be true: hand object_0, sneeze object_1, texture object_2, next object_1 object_2, and vase object_0 object_1
Once tightfisted is performed the following facts will be true: next object_0 object_2
Once tightfisted is performed the following facts will be false: vase object_0 object_1

[STATEMENT]
As initial conditions I have that, cats object_0, cats object_1, collect object_6 object_2, collect object_7 object_3, hand object_8, next object_0 object_7, next object_1 object_7, next object_4 object_6, next object_5 object_7, next object_8 object_7, sneeze object_4, sneeze object_5, spring object_6, spring object_7, stupendous object_2, stupendous object_3, texture object_6 and texture object_7.
My goal is to have that next object_8 object_6.

My plan is as follows:

NATURAL-PLAN sas_plan_5
------------------------------
Plan (3 steps, uses discrete time steps step_0 → step_3):

1) Time: step_0 → step_1 (time interval: step_0 to step_1)
   Action: sip object_8 object_0 object_7
   Parameters: x=object_8, y=object_0, z=object_7
   Preconditions (satisfied at step_0): hand object_8; cats object_0; texture object_7; next object_8 object_7; next object_0 object_7.
   Effects (applied at step_1): add vase object_8 object_0; remove next object_8 object_7.
   Notes: Advances the global time marker from step_0 to step_1.

2) Time: step_1 → step_2 (time interval: step_1 to step_2)
   Action: memory object_0 object_7 object_6
   Parameters: x=object_0, y=object_7, z=object_6
   Preconditions (satisfied at step_1): cats object_0; spring object_7; spring object_6; next object_0 object_7 (this remained true after step 1).
   Effects (applied at step_2): add next object_0 object_6; remove next object_0 object_7.
   Notes: Advances the global time marker from step_1 to step_2.

3) Time: step_2 → step_3 (time interval: step_2 to step_3)
   Action: paltry object_8 object_0 object_6
   Parameters: x=object_8, y=object_0, z=object_6
   Preconditions (satisfied at step_2): hand object_8; cats object_0; texture object_6; vase object_8 object_0 (created by step 1); next object_0 object_6 (created by step 2).
   Effects (applied at step_3): add next object_8 object_6 (goal achieved); remove vase object_8 object_0.
   Notes: Advances the global time marker from step_2 to step_3.

Goal achieved after step 3: next object_8 object_6.
