Plan (3 steps, uses discrete time steps step_0 → step_3):

1) Time: step_0 → step_1 (time interval: step_0 to step_1)
   Action: sip object_8 object_0 object_7
   Parameters: x=object_8, y=object_0, z=object_7
   Preconditions (satisfied at step_0): hand object_8; cats object_0; texture object_7; next object_8 object_7; next object_0 object_7.
   Effects (applied at step_1): add vase object_8 object_0; remove next object_8 object_7.
   Notes: Advances the global time marker from step_0 to step_1.

2) Time: step_1 → step_2 (time interval: step_1 to step_2)
   Action: memory object_0 object_7 object_6
   Parameters: x=object_0, y=object_7, z=object_6
   Preconditions (satisfied at step_1): cats object_0; spring object_7; spring object_6; next object_0 object_7 (this remained true after step 1).
   Effects (applied at step_2): add next object_0 object_6; remove next object_0 object_7.
   Notes: Advances the global time marker from step_1 to step_2.

3) Time: step_2 → step_3 (time interval: step_2 to step_3)
   Action: paltry object_8 object_0 object_6
   Parameters: x=object_8, y=object_0, z=object_6
   Preconditions (satisfied at step_2): hand object_8; cats object_0; texture object_6; vase object_8 object_0 (created by step 1); next object_0 object_6 (created by step 2).
   Effects (applied at step_3): add next object_8 object_6 (goal achieved); remove vase object_8 object_0.
   Notes: Advances the global time marker from step_2 to step_3.

Goal achieved after step 3: next object_8 object_6.
