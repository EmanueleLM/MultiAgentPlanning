Plan (3 steps, discrete timestamps t0→t1→t2→t3; cost = 3):

Step 1 — (t0 → t1)
Action: sip object_8 object_0 object_7
- Parameters: ?o0=object_8, ?o1=object_0, ?o2=object_7
- Preconditions checked (all true at t0):
  - (hand object_8)            — present in init
  - (cats object_0)            — present in init
  - (texture object_7)         — present in init
  - (next object_8 object_7)   — present in init
  - (next object_0 object_7)   — present in init
  - (current s0)               — s0 is current at start
  - (succ s0 s1)               — available in init
- Effects applied at t1:
  - Added: (vase object_8 object_0)
  - Deleted: (next object_8 object_7)
  - Time-step: current becomes s1 (current s0 removed, current s1 added)
- Resulting relevant facts after step:
  - vase object_8 object_0 (new)
  - next object_8 object_7 (removed)
  - next object_0 object_7, next object_1 object_7, next object_4 object_6, next object_5 object_7 remain
  - current = s1

Step 2 — (t1 → t2)
Action: memory object_0 object_7 object_6
- Parameters: ?o0=object_0, ?o1=object_7, ?o2=object_6
- Preconditions checked (all true at t1):
  - (cats object_0)           — present in init
  - (spring object_7)         — present in init
  - (spring object_6)         — present in init
  - (next object_0 object_7)  — remained after step 1
  - (current s1)              — set by step 1
  - (succ s1 s2)              — available in init
- Effects applied at t2:
  - Added: (next object_0 object_6)
  - Deleted: (next object_0 object_7)
  - Time-step: current becomes s2 (current s1 removed, current s2 added)
- Resulting relevant facts after step:
  - next object_0 object_6 (new)
  - next object_0 object_7 (removed)
  - vase object_8 object_0 (still present)
  - other next relations remain as before
  - current = s2

Step 3 — (t2 → t3)
Action: paltry object_8 object_0 object_6
- Parameters: ?o0=object_8, ?o1=object_0, ?o2=object_6
- Preconditions checked (all true at t2):
  - (hand object_8)            — init
  - (cats object_0)            — init
  - (texture object_6)         — init
  - (vase object_8 object_0)   — created by step 1
  - (next object_0 object_6)   — created by step 2
  - (current s2)               — set by step 2
  - (succ s2 s3)               — available in init
- Effects applied at t3:
  - Added: (next object_8 object_6)   — GOAL achieved
  - Deleted: (vase object_8 object_0)
  - Time-step: current becomes s3 (current s2 removed, current s3 added)
- Final relevant facts after step:
  - next object_8 object_6 (present) — goal satisfied
  - vase object_8 object_0 (removed)
  - current = s3

Assumptions and notes
- All required initial facts used by each action were present when checked; no extra facts or bookkeeping were introduced beyond the action effects.
- Time is represented by the step variable progression (s0→s1→s2→s3). I used t0,t1,t2,t3 to indicate these discrete transitions.
- The plan exactly matches the provided sequence and achieves the goal (next object_8 object_6) at the end of step 3.
