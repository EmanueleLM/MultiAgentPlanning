Plan timeline (timestamps in seconds; each action assumed duration = 1.0s). For every step I list: action instance, bound parameters, required preconditions (as taken verbatim from the specification with objects substituted), which of those were true immediately before the action, and the immediate add / delete effects produced by the action.

Initial facts (for reference): 
(cats object_0), (collect object_5 object_1), (collect object_6 object_2), (hand object_7), (hand object_8), (next object_0 object_6), (next object_3 object_5), (next object_4 object_6), (next object_7 object_6), (next object_8 object_5), (sneeze object_3), (sneeze object_4), (spring object_5), (spring object_6), (stupendous object_1), (stupendous object_2), (texture object_5), (texture object_6).

Step 1 — t = 0.0s → 1.0s
- Action: memory(object_0, object_6, object_5)
- Preconditions (from "memory" with parameters substituted):
  1. (cats object_0)
  2. (spring object_6)
  3. (spring object_5)
  4. (next object_0 object_6)
- Were these true immediately before the action? Yes — all four are true in the initial state.
- Immediate effects:
  - Add: (next object_0 object_5)
  - Delete: (not (next object_0 object_6))
- Notes: After this step, next(object_0, object_5) becomes true and next(object_0, object_6) becomes false.

Step 2 — t = 1.0s → 2.0s
- Action: sip(object_8, object_0, object_5)
- Preconditions (from "sip" with parameters substituted):
  1. (hand object_8)
  2. (cats object_0)
  3. (texture object_5)
  4. (next object_8 object_5)
  5. (next object_0 object_5)
- Were these true immediately before the action? Yes.
  - hand object_8 — true (initial)
  - cats object_0 — true (initial)
  - texture object_5 — true (initial)
  - next object_8 object_5 — true (initial)
  - next object_0 object_5 — true (was added by Step 1)
- Immediate effects:
  - Add: (vase object_8 object_0)
  - Delete: (not (next object_8 object_5))
- Notes: This step creates vase(object_8, object_0) and removes next(object_8, object_5). next(object_0, object_5) remains true (it is not deleted by this sip instance).

Step 3 — t = 2.0s → 3.0s
- Action: memory(object_0, object_5, object_6)
- Preconditions (from "memory" with parameters substituted):
  1. (cats object_0)
  2. (spring object_5)
  3. (spring object_6)
  4. (next object_0 object_5)
- Were these true immediately before the action? Yes.
  - cats object_0 — initial
  - spring object_5 — initial
  - spring object_6 — initial
  - next object_0 object_5 — true (added by Step 1 and not deleted by Step 2)
- Immediate effects:
  - Add: (next object_0 object_6)
  - Delete: (not (next object_0 object_5))
- Notes: This restores next(object_0, object_6) and removes next(object_0, object_5).

Step 4 — t = 3.0s → 4.0s
- Action: paltry(object_8, object_0, object_6)
- Preconditions (from "paltry" with parameters substituted):
  1. (hand object_8)
  2. (cats object_0)
  3. (texture object_6)
  4. (vase object_8 object_0)
  5. (next object_0 object_6)
- Were these true immediately before the action? Yes.
  - hand object_8 — initial
  - cats object_0 — initial
  - texture object_6 — initial
  - vase object_8 object_0 — added by Step 2
  - next object_0 object_6 — added by Step 3
- Immediate effects:
  - Add: (next object_8 object_6)
  - Delete: (not (vase object_8 object_0))
- Notes: After this final step, next(object_8, object_6) is true and vase(object_8, object_0) is removed.

Final verification (at t = 4.0s):
- next(object_7, object_6) — was true in the initial state and never deleted → still true.
- next(object_8, object_6) — made true by Step 4.
- Therefore the planning goal (next object_7 object_6) and (next object_8 object_6) is satisfied.

Summary:
- Executed exactly the four actions in the supplied plan, with timestamps and durations (1.0s each).
- All preconditions held when each action was applied.
- Effect traces are shown step-by-step and the final goal is achieved at t = 4.0s.
