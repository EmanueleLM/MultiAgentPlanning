Summary: 13 actions, each executed as an instantaneous step of duration 1 time unit (unit-cost plan). Steps are listed in order with timestamp, action name, parameters (role), key preconditions checked at that moment, and the effects (what is added and what is deleted). The sequence exactly follows the provided plan.

Step 1 (time 0 → 1)
Action: wretched(object_4 — sneeze, object_7 — texture, object_8 — texture, object_2 — stupendous)
Preconditions (satisfied): texture(object_7), texture(object_8), collect(object_7,object_2), collect(object_8,object_2), next(object_4,object_7)

Preconditions (satisfied): texture(object_5), texture(object_6), collect(object_5,object_1), collect(object_6,object_1), next(object_3,object_5)
Effects: add next(object_3,object_6); delete next(object_3,object_5)
State change summary: object_3’s next-link changed from object_5 → object_6.

Step 6 (time 5 → 6)
Action: clip(object_11 — hand, object_3 — sneeze, object_6 — texture)
Preconditions (satisfied): texture(object_6), next(object_3,object_6), next(object_11,object_6)
Effects: add vase(object_11,object_3); delete next(object_11,object_6)
State change summary: created vase(object_11,object_3); object_11’s next-link to object_6 removed.

Step 7 (time 6 → 7)
Action: wretched(object_3 — sneeze, object_6 — texture, object_5 — texture, object_1 — stupendous)
Preconditions (satisfied): texture(object_6), texture(object_5), collect(object_6,object_1), collect(object_5,object_1), next(object_3,object_6)
Effects: add next(object_3,object_5); delete next(object_3,object_6)
State change summary: object_3’s next-link changed back from object_6 → object_5.

Step 8 (time 7 → 8)
Action: tightfisted(object_11 — hand, object_3 — sneeze, object_5 — texture)
Preconditions (satisfied): texture(object_5), next(object_3,object_5), vase(object_11,object_3)
Effects: add next(object_11,object_5); delete vase(object_11,object_3)
State change summary: object_11 now has next → object_5; vase(object_11,object_3) removed.

Step 9 (time 8 → 9)
Action: sip(object_9 — hand, object_0 — cat, object_5 — texture)
Preconditions (satisfied): texture(object_5), next(object_9,object_5), next(object_0,object_5)
Effects: add vase(object_9,object_0); delete next(object_9,object_5)
State change summary: created vase(object_9,object_0); object_9’s next-link to object_5 removed.

Step 10 (time 9 → 10)
Action: sip(object_11 — hand, object_0 — cat, object_5 — texture)
Preconditions (satisfied): texture(object_5), next(object_11,object_5), next(object_0,object_5)
Effects: add vase(object_11,object_0); delete next(object_11,object_5)
State change summary: created vase(object_11,object_0); object_11’s next-link to object_5 removed.

Step 11 (time 10 → 11)
Action: memory(object_0 — cat, object_5 — spring, object_7 — spring)
Preconditions (satisfied): spring(object_5), spring(object_7), next(object_0,object_5)
Effects: add next(object_0,object_7); delete next(object_0,object_5)
State change summary: object_0’s next-link changed from object_5 → object_7.

Step 12 (time 11 → 12)
Action: paltry(object_9 — hand, object_0 — cat, object_7 — texture)
Preconditions (satisfied): texture(object_7), vase(object_9,object_0), next(object_0,object_7)
Effects: add next(object_9,object_7); delete vase(object_9,object_0)
State change summary: object_9 now has next → object_7 (goal element achieved for object_9); vase(object_9,object_0) removed.

Step 13 (time 12 → 13)
Action: paltry(object_11 — hand, object_0 — cat, object_7 — texture)
Preconditions (satisfied): texture(object_7), vase(object_11,object_0), next(object_0,object_7)

State change summary: object_11 now has next → object_7 (goal element achieved for object_11); vase(object_11,object_0) removed.

Final check (after time 13)
Goal facts reached:
- next(object_10,object_7) — established at Step 4
- next(object_11,object_7) — established at Step 13
- next(object_9,object_7) — established at Step 12

Total actions: 13 (unit cost each). Final state satisfies the global planning goal.
