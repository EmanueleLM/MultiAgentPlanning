Plan summary (3 steps, unit durations; total cost = 3)

Step 1 — tightfisted(st0_start → st1, o0=object_9, o1=object_3, o2=object_6)
- Timestamp: t = 0.0 → 1.0 (duration ≈ 1 time unit)
- Preconditions checked (all true in the initial state):
  - current stage: st0_start (true)
  - next-stage(st0_start, st1) (true)
  - hand(object_9) (true)
  - sneeze(object_3) (true)
  - texture(object_6) (true)
  - next(object_3, object_6) (true)
  - vase(object_9, object_3) (true)
- Effects applied:
  - advance stage: current-stage becomes st1 (st0_start removed, st1 added)
  - add next(object_9, object_6)  (this establishes one of the goal facts)
  - remove vase(object_9, object_3)
- Resulting notable facts after step: next(object_9, object_6) is true.

Step 2 — paltry(st1 → st2, o0=object_11, o1=object_0, o2=object_7)
- Timestamp: t = 1.0 → 2.0 (duration ≈ 1 time unit)
- Preconditions checked (all true at start of step 2):
  - current stage: st1 (set by step 1)
  - next-stage(st1, st2) (true)
  - hand(object_11) (initially true)
  - cats(object_0) (initially true)
  - texture(object_7) (initially true)
  - vase(object_11, object_0) (initially true)
  - next(object_0, object_7) (initially true)
- Effects applied:
  - advance stage: current-stage becomes st2 (st1 removed, st2 added)
  - add next(object_11, object_7)  (this establishes a second goal fact)
  - remove vase(object_11, object_0)
- Resulting notable facts after step: next(object_11, object_7) is true.

Step 3 — paltry(st2 → st3, o0=object_10, o1=object_0, o2=object_8)
- Timestamp: t = 2.0 → 3.0 (duration ≈ 1 time unit)
- Preconditions checked (all true at start of step 3):
  - current stage: st2 (set by step 2)
  - next-stage(st2, st3) (true)
  - hand(object_10) (initially true)
  - cats(object_0) (initially true)
  - texture(object_8) (initially true)
  - vase(object_10, object_0) (initially true)
  - next(object_0, object_8) (initially true)
- Effects applied:
  - advance stage: current-stage becomes st3 (st2 removed, st3 added)
  - add next(object_10, object_8)  (this establishes the third goal fact)
  - remove vase(object_10, object_0)
- Resulting notable facts after step: next(object_10, object_8) is true.

Final verification (after t ≈ 3.0)
- Goal demanded:
  - next(object_10, object_8) — true (added in Step 3)
  - next(object_11, object_7) — true (added in Step 2)
  - next(object_9, object_6) — true (added in Step 1)
- All three goal facts are satisfied. Total plan cost = 3 (three unit actions).
