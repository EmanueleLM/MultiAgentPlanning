Below is a clear, step-by-step, human-readable trace of the given plan. I number steps as timestamps t=0, t=1, ... (each action advances the linear stage by one successor; think of each action taking one time unit). For each step I show: the action and its parameters, the stage transition performed, the main preconditions relied on at that time, and the direct effects (which atoms are added and which are deleted). I only list the predicates that the domain's actions actually read or change (hand, cats, texture, vase, next, sneeze, collect, spring, stupendous, current stage).

Initial state (before t=0)
- current stage: stage_0
- Relevant initial atoms (excerpt): 
  - cats: object_0, object_1
  - collect: (object_6 object_2), (object_7 object_2), (object_8 object_3), (object_9 object_3)
  - hand: object_10, object_11, object_12
  - next: (object_0 object_6), (object_1 object_8), (object_10 object_9), (object_11 object_6), (object_12 object_6), (object_4 object_7), (object_5 object_8)
  - sneeze: object_4, object_5
  - spring: object_6, object_8
  - stupendous: object_2, object_3
  - texture: object_6, object_7, object_8, object_9
  - No initial vase facts

  - next(object_12, object_8): added at Step 16 — satisfied.

Summary / Notes
- The plan strictly follows the given action sequence and stage increments (stage_0 → stage_19).
- Each action consumes the indicated preconditions and produces the effects stated in the domain model; the trace above lists those preconditions and effects as they were used/created at each timestamp.
- All three goal atoms are achieved by the end of Step 19:
  - object_10 → object_7 (by tightfisted at t=18→19),
  - object_11 → object_9 (by tightfisted at t=6→7),
  - object_12 → object_8 (by paltry at t=15→16).
- Time model: actions are shown as happening at integer timestamps t=0..18 (each action consumes the current stage and advances it to the next successor stage). Each action may be regarded as taking one time unit in this linear staging interpretation.
