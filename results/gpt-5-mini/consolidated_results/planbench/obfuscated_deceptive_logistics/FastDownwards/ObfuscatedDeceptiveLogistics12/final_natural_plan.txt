Execution trace (stepwise simulation of the given plan). Each step lists: action, start timestamp (current stage) -> end timestamp (next stage), required preconditions with whether they were present at that moment, and postconditions (facts added / facts removed). All timestamps are the stage symbols from the problem (st0..st18). No precondition violations occurred.

Final verification (after step 18, current = st18):
  Goal predicates required:
    - (next object_10 object_8) ... PRESENT (added at step 8, never removed)
    - (next object_11 object_7) ... PRESENT (added at step 5, never removed)
    - (next object_9 object_6) .... PRESENT (added at step 18)
  Conclusion: All required goal facts are true at the end (goal satisfied).
