Summary of the executed plan (19 steps). Each step listed with timestamp (t = integer time), duration = 1 time unit, action name with grounded parameters, the action’s required preconditions (as stated in the domain), the effects produced by the action (adds / removes), and a short note about why the preconditions hold at that moment.

t = 0 (duration 1) — wretched object_5 object_8 object_9 object_3
- Preconditions: (next object_5 object_8), (collect object_8 object_3), (collect object_9 object_3)
- Effects: add (next object_5 object_9); remove (next object_5 object_8)
- Note: initial state contains the required (next object_5 object_8) and the two collect facts.

t = 1 (duration 1) — clip object_10 object_5 object_9
- Preconditions: (next object_5 object_9), (next object_10 object_9)
- Effects: add (vase object_10 object_5); remove (next object_10 object_9)
- Note: (next object_5 object_9) was created at t=0; (next object_10 object_9) was in the initial state.

t = 2 (duration 1) — wretched object_4 object_7 object_6 object_2
- Preconditions: (next object_4 object_7), (collect object_7 object_2), (collect object_6 object_2)
- Effects: add (next object_4 object_6); remove (next object_4 object_7)
- Note: all preconditions are satisfied by the initial state.

t = 3 (duration 1) — sip object_12 object_0 object_6
- Preconditions: (next object_12 object_6), (next object_0 object_6)
- Effects: add (vase object_12 object_0); remove (next object_12 object_6)
- Note: both next facts are present initially.

t = 4 (duration 1) — sip object_11 object_0 object_6
- Preconditions: (next object_11 object_6), (next object_0 object_6)
- Effects: add (vase object_11 object_0); remove (next object_11 object_6)
- Note: both next facts are present initially.

t = 5 (duration 1) — wretched object_5 object_9 object_8 object_3
- Preconditions: (next object_5 object_9), (collect object_9 object_3), (collect object_8 object_3)
- Effects: add (next object_5 object_8); remove (next object_5 object_9)
- Note: (next object_5 object_9) existed (created at t=0), so this reverts object_5’s next to object_8.

t = 6 (duration 1) — tightfisted object_10 object_5 object_8
- Preconditions: (next object_5 object_8), (vase object_10 object_5)
- Effects: add (next object_10 object_8); remove (vase object_10 object_5)
- Note: both preconditions hold: object_5→object_8 from t=5 and vase object_10 object_5 from t=1.

t = 7 (duration 1) — sip object_10 object_1 object_8
- Preconditions: (next object_10 object_8), (next object_1 object_8)
- Effects: add (vase object_10 object_1); remove (next object_10 object_8)
- Note: object_10→object_8 created at t=6; object_1→object_8 was initial.

t = 8 (duration 1) — memory object_1 object_8 object_6
- Preconditions: (next object_1 object_8)
- Effects: add (next object_1 object_6); remove (next object_1 object_8)
- Note: object_1→object_8 was initial and used here to produce object_1→object_6.

t = 9 (duration 1) — paltry object_10 object_1 object_6
- Preconditions: (vase object_10 object_1), (next object_1 object_6)
- Effects: add (next object_10 object_6); remove (vase object_10 object_1)
- Note: vase was added at t=7, next object_1→object_6 added at t=8.

t = 10 (duration 1) — clip object_10 object_4 object_6
- Preconditions: (next object_4 object_6), (next object_10 object_6)
- Effects: add (vase object_10 object_4); remove (next object_10 object_6)
- Note: object_4→object_6 was set at t=2; object_10→object_6 was set at t=9.

t = 11 (duration 1) — wretched object_4 object_6 object_7 object_2
- Preconditions: (next object_4 object_6), (collect object_6 object_2), (collect object_7 object_2)
- Effects: add (next object_4 object_7); remove (next object_4 object_6)
- Note: object_4→object_6 still present (from t=2) and the collect facts are initial.

t = 12 (duration 1) — tightfisted object_10 object_4 object_7
- Preconditions: (next object_4 object_7), (vase object_10 object_4)
- Effects: add (next object_10 object_7); remove (vase object_10 object_4)
- Note: object_4→object_7 was set at t=11; vase object_10 object_4 was set at t=10. This step produces (next object_10 object_7) — one of the three goal facts.

t = 13 (duration 1) — memory object_0 object_6 object_8
- Preconditions: (next object_0 object_6)
- Effects: add (next object_0 object_8); remove (next object_0 object_6)
- Note: object_0→object_6 was initial; this creates object_0→object_8 used later.

t = 14 (duration 1) — paltry object_12 object_0 object_8
- Preconditions: (vase object_12 object_0), (next object_0 object_8)
- Effects: add (next object_12 object_8); remove (vase object_12 object_0)
- Note: vase object_12 object_0 was created at t=3; next object_0→object_8 was created at t=13. This produces (next object_12 object_8), satisfying another goal fact.

t = 15 (duration 1) — paltry object_11 object_0 object_8
- Preconditions: (vase object_11 object_0), (next object_0 object_8)
- Effects: add (next object_11 object_8); remove (vase object_11 object_0)
- Note: vase object_11 object_0 was created at t=4; next object_0→object_8 from t=13. This creates object_11→object_8 (intermediate).

t = 16 (duration 1) — clip object_11 object_5 object_8
- Preconditions: (next object_5 object_8), (next object_11 object_8)
- Effects: add (vase object_11 object_5); remove (next object_11 object_8)
- Note: object_5→object_8 was present from t=5; object_11→object_8 from t=15. This replaces object_11→object_8 with a vase relation.

t = 17 (duration 1) — wretched object_5 object_8 object_9 object_3
- Preconditions: (next object_5 object_8), (collect object_8 object_3), (collect object_9 object_3)
- Effects: add (next object_5 object_9); remove (next object_5 object_8)
- Note: this step recreates (next object_5 object_9), used next.

t = 18 (duration 1) — tightfisted object_11 object_5 object_9
- Preconditions: (next object_5 object_9), (vase object_11 object_5)
- Effects: add (next object_11 object_9); remove (vase object_11 object_5)
- Note: (next object_5 object_9) was created at t=17 and vase object_11 object_5 was created at t=16. This produces (next object_11 object_9), the last goal fact.

Final result (after t = 18):
- (next object_10 object_7) — created at t=12
- (next object_11 object_9) — created at t=18
- (next object_12 object_8) — created at t=14

All three goal facts are present; the plan used 19 actions (cost = 19 units, one unit per action). Each step above matches exactly the grounded action invocations in the provided plan and lists the preconditions and effects as stated in the domain.
