Below is a clear, step-by-step human-readable trace of the provided plan. Each step is listed in order, with a timestamp assuming each action takes 1 time unit (start -> end). For each action I list the required preconditions (as predicate instances) and the effects (what the action adds and what it deletes), using the predicate names from the domain.

Step 1 — time 0 -> 1:
Action: clip(object_11, object_5, object_9)
- Preconditions: (hand object_11), (sneeze object_5), (texture object_9), (next object_5 object_9), (next object_11 object_9)
- Effects: add (vase object_11 object_5); delete (next object_11 object_9)

Step 2 — time 1 -> 2:
Action: wretched(object_5, object_9, object_8, object_3)
- Preconditions: (sneeze object_5), (texture object_9), (texture object_8), (stupendous object_3), (next object_5 object_9), (collect object_9 object_3), (collect object_8 object_3)
- Effects: add (next object_5 object_8); delete (next object_5 object_9)

Step 3 — time 2 -> 3:
Action: tightfisted(object_11, object_5, object_8)
- Preconditions: (hand object_11), (sneeze object_5), (texture object_8), (next object_5 object_8), (vase object_11 object_5)
- Effects: add (next object_11 object_8); delete (vase object_11 object_5)

Step 4 — time 3 -> 4:
Action: clip(object_12, object_4, object_6)
- Preconditions: (hand object_12), (sneeze object_4), (texture object_6), (next object_4 object_6), (next object_12 object_6)
- Effects: add (vase object_12 object_4); delete (next object_12 object_6)

Step 5 — time 4 -> 5:
Action: sip(object_11, object_0, object_8)
- Preconditions: (hand object_11), (cats object_0), (texture object_8), (next object_11 object_8), (next object_0 object_8)
- Effects: add (vase object_11 object_0); delete (next object_11 object_8)

Step 6 — time 5 -> 6:
Action: sip(object_10, object_0, object_8)
- Preconditions: (hand object_10), (cats object_0), (texture object_8), (next object_10 object_8), (next object_0 object_8)
- Effects: add (vase object_10 object_0); delete (next object_10 object_8)

Step 7 — time 6 -> 7:
Action: memory(object_0, object_8, object_6)
- Preconditions: (cats object_0), (spring object_8), (spring object_6), (next object_0 object_8)
- Effects: add (next object_0 object_6); delete (next object_0 object_8)

Step 8 — time 7 -> 8:
Action: paltry(object_11, object_0, object_6)
- Preconditions: (hand object_11), (cats object_0), (texture object_6), (vase object_11 object_0), (next object_0 object_6)
- Effects: add (next object_11 object_6); delete (vase object_11 object_0)

Step 9 — time 8 -> 9:
Action: clip(object_11, object_4, object_6)
- Preconditions: (hand object_11), (sneeze object_4), (texture object_6), (next object_4 object_6), (next object_11 object_6)
- Effects: add (vase object_11 object_4); delete (next object_11 object_6)

Step 10 — time 9 -> 10:
Action: paltry(object_10, object_0, object_6)
- Preconditions: (hand object_10), (cats object_0), (texture object_6), (vase object_10 object_0), (next object_0 object_6)
- Effects: add (next object_10 object_6); delete (vase object_10 object_0)

Step 11 — time 10 -> 11:
Action: clip(object_10, object_4, object_6)
- Preconditions: (hand object_10), (sneeze object_4), (texture object_6), (next object_4 object_6), (next object_10 object_6)
- Effects: add (vase object_10 object_4); delete (next object_10 object_6)

Step 12 — time 11 -> 12:
Action: wretched(object_4, object_6, object_7, object_2)
- Preconditions: (sneeze object_4), (texture object_6), (texture object_7), (stupendous object_2), (next object_4 object_6), (collect object_6 object_2), (collect object_7 object_2)
- Effects: add (next object_4 object_7); delete (next object_4 object_6)

Step 13 — time 12 -> 13:
Action: tightfisted(object_12, object_4, object_7)
- Preconditions: (hand object_12), (sneeze object_4), (texture object_7), (next object_4 object_7), (vase object_12 object_4)
- Effects: add (next object_12 object_7); delete (vase object_12 object_4)

Step 14 — time 13 -> 14:
Action: tightfisted(object_11, object_4, object_7)
- Preconditions: (hand object_11), (sneeze object_4), (texture object_7), (next object_4 object_7), (vase object_11 object_4)
- Effects: add (next object_11 object_7); delete (vase object_11 object_4)

Step 15 — time 14 -> 15:
Action: tightfisted(object_10, object_4, object_7)
- Preconditions: (hand object_10), (sneeze object_4), (texture object_7), (next object_4 object_7), (vase object_10 object_4)
- Effects: add (next object_10 object_7); delete (vase object_10 object_4)

Outcome after Step 15 (time = 15):
- The goal predicates are achieved:
  - (next object_10 object_7)
  - (next object_11 object_7)
  - (next object_12 object_7)

Total plan cost / total time: 15 units (15 actions × 1 time unit each).
