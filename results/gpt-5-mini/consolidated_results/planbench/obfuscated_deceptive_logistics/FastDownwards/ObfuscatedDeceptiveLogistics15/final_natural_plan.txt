Below is a step-by-step, human-readable trace of the given plan. Each step matches exactly one action from the provided plan (no actions added or removed). I list a timestamp assuming each action takes 1.0 time unit (start times t = 0.0, 1.0, 2.0, ...), the action signature and a short plain-English description of its preconditions and effects, and the concrete change to the changing relations (next / vase) produced by the action. I also track the evolving next/ vase facts so you can see the causal chain that reaches the goal.

Initial relevant facts (before step 1)

Final check vs requested goal facts:
- next object_10 object_8  → present (10,8) ✓
- next object_11 object_6  → present (11,6) ✓
- next object_12 object_8  → present (12,8) ✓
- next object_9 object_5   → present (9,5) ✓

Conclusion
- The 22-step plan above is exactly the given plan translated to human-readable steps with timestamps (1.0 time unit per action). Each step lists the preconditions used and the concrete changes to the dynamic relations (next and vase). After step 22, all four goal next-relations are true, so the plan achieves the stated goal.
