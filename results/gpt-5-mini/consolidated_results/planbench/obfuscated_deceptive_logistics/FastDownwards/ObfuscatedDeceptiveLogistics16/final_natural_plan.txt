Below is a clear, step-by-step human-readable trace of the given plan. Each step reports the action, the concrete objects involved, the time transition (stage timestamps), the key preconditions that make the action valid in the current state, and the net effects (what is added and what is removed). I follow the plan exactly and show the 1-step time advance from stage_X to stage_Y for each action.

Initial useful facts (for quick reference)
- cats: object_0, object_1
- hand: object_10, object_11, object_12, object_13
- sneeze: object_4, object_5
- spring: object_6, object_8
- stupendous: object_2, object_3
- texture: object_6, object_7, object_8, object_9
- collect relations: (object_6 collects object_2), (object_7 collects object_2), (object_8 collects object_3), (object_9 collects object_3)
- initial next relations: next(0,6), next(1,6), next(10,9), next(11,8), next(12,9), next(13,6), next(4,7), next(5,9)
- time begins at stage_0; each action advances now from stage_i to its succ stage_j.

Plan steps

1) Step 1 — sip object_13 object_0 object_6 (stage_0 → stage_1)

Outcome (final state claims)
- Final next relations achieved by this sequence:
  - next(object_10, object_6)

  - next(object_12, object_7)
  - next(object_13, object_9)
- Time is advanced to stage_22 (now = stage_22).
- The plan matches the provided sequence exactly; each action consumed one time step (stage_i → stage_{i+1}) and applied the domain effects described above.
