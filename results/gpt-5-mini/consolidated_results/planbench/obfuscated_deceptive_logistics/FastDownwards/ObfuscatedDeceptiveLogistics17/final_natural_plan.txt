Summary of key objects (from the initial state)
- Cats: object_0, object_1
- Hands: object_10, object_11, object_12, object_13
- Textures: object_6, object_7, object_8, object_9
- Sneeze: object_4, object_5
- Spring: object_6, object_8
- Stupendous: object_2, object_3
- Collect relations: collect(object_6,object_2), collect(object_7,object_2), collect(object_8,object_3), collect(object_9,object_3)
- Initial next relations: next(0,8), next(1,8), next(10,7), next(11,9), next(12,8), next(13,9), next(4,7), next(5,9)
- Initial current-stage: s0

Execution assumptions
- Each action is executed at the current stage and advances to its successor stage (s0 → s1 → ...).
- Each action takes 1 time unit. I report start and end timestamps as integer stage times: action executing at time t runs from t to t+1.

Step-by-step human-readable plan (matches the provided PDDL plan exactly)

1) Time 0 → 1 (stage s0 → s1)
Action: sip(object_12, object_0, object_8)
- Preconditions satisfied: hand(object_12), cats(object_0), texture(object_8), next(object_12,object_8), next(object_0,object_8).
- Effects: add vase(object_12,object_0). Remove next(object_12,object_8).
- Resulting relevant facts after step: vase(12,0) = true; next(12,8) removed.

2) Time 1 → 2 (stage s1 → s2)
Action: memory(object_0, object_8, object_6)
- Preconditions satisfied: cats(object_0), spring(object_8), spring(object_6), next(object_0,object_8).
- Effects: add next(object_0,object_6). Remove next(object_0,object_8).
- Resulting relevant facts: next(0,6) added; next(0,8) removed.

3) Time 2 → 3 (stage s2 → s3)

- Preconditions satisfied: hand(object_12), cats(object_0), texture(object_6), vase(object_12,object_0), next(object_0,object_6).
- Effects: add next(object_12,object_6). Remove vase(object_12,object_0).

4) Time 3 → 4 (stage s3 → s4)
Action: clip(object_10, object_4, object_7)
- Preconditions satisfied: hand(object_10), sneeze(object_4), texture(object_7), next(object_4,object_7), next(object_10,object_7).
- Effects: add vase(object_10,object_4). Remove next(object_10,object_7).

Action: wretched(object_4, object_7, object_6, object_2)
- Preconditions satisfied: sneeze(object_4), texture(object_7), texture(object_6), stupendous(object_2), next(object_4,object_7), collect(object_7,object_2), collect(object_6,object_2).
- Effects: add next(object_4,object_6). Remove next(object_4,object_7).
- Resulting relevant facts: next(4,6) added; next(4,7) removed.

6) Time 5 → 6 (stage s5 → s6)
Action: tightfisted(object_10, object_4, object_6)
- Preconditions satisfied: hand(object_10), sneeze(object_4), texture(object_6), next(object_4,object_6), vase(object_10,object_4).
- Effects: add next(object_10,object_6). Remove vase(object_10,object_4).
- Resulting relevant facts: next(10,6) added (this satisfies goal condition next object_10 → object_6); vase(10,4) removed.

7) Time 6 → 7 (stage s6 → s7)
Action: clip(object_12, object_4, object_6)
- Preconditions satisfied: hand(object_12), sneeze(object_4), texture(object_6), next(object_4,object_6), next(object_12,object_6).
- Effects: add vase(object_12,object_4). Remove next(object_12,object_6).
- Resulting relevant facts: vase(12,4) added; next(12,6) removed (temporary).

8) Time 7 → 8 (stage s7 → s8)
Action: wretched(object_4, object_6, object_7, object_2)
- Preconditions satisfied: sneeze(object_4), texture(object_6), texture(object_7), stupendous(object_2), next(object_4,object_6), collect(object_6,object_2), collect(object_7,object_2).
- Effects: add next(object_4,object_7). Remove next(object_4,object_6).
- Resulting relevant facts: next(4,7) restored.

9) Time 8 → 9 (stage s8 → s9)
Action: tightfisted(object_12, object_4, object_7)
- Preconditions satisfied: hand(object_12), sneeze(object_4), texture(object_7), next(object_4,object_7), vase(object_12,object_4).
- Effects: add next(object_12,object_7). Remove vase(object_12,object_4).
- Resulting relevant facts: next(12,7) added — this satisfies goal condition next object_12 → object_7.

10) Time 9 → 10 (stage s9 → s10)
Action: clip(object_11, object_5, object_9)
- Preconditions satisfied: hand(object_11), sneeze(object_5), texture(object_9), next(object_5,object_9), next(object_11,object_9).
- Effects: add vase(object_11,object_5). Remove next(object_11,object_9).
- Resulting relevant facts: vase(11,5) added; next(11,9) removed.

11) Time 10 → 11 (stage s10 → s11)
Action: wretched(object_5, object_9, object_8, object_3)
- Preconditions satisfied: sneeze(object_5), texture(object_9), texture(object_8), stupendous(object_3), next(object_5,object_9), collect(object_9,object_3), collect(object_8,object_3).
- Effects: add next(object_5,object_8). Remove next(object_5,object_9).

12) Time 11 → 12 (stage s11 → s12)
Action: tightfisted(object_11, object_5, object_8)
- Preconditions satisfied: hand(object_11), sneeze(object_5), texture(object_8), next(object_5,object_8), vase(object_11,object_5).
- Effects: add next(object_11,object_8). Remove vase(object_11,object_5).
- Resulting relevant facts: next(11,8) added — this satisfies goal condition next object_11 → object_8.

Final state (after time 12 / current-stage s12)
- Goal next relations achieved:
  - next(object_10, object_6) — achieved at step 6
  - next(object_11, object_8) — achieved at step 12
  - next(object_12, object_7) — achieved at step 9
  - next(object_13, object_9) — this was true in the initial state and never removed
- current-stage is s12 (plan reached s12 as required)

Plan cost: 12 (12 actions, unit cost each)

Notes
- Each step above precisely follows the action sequence and parameters in the given plan.
- Each action is shown with its stage/timestamp (t → t+1), the preconditions that allow it to execute, and the exact propositional effects (which next and vase facts were added or removed).
