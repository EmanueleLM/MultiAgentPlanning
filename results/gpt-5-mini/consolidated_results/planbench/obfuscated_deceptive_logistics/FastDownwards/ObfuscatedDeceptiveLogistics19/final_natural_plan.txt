Plan (sequence of human-readable actions — matches the given plan exactly):

Start time t=0.

1) t=0 → t=1 (duration 1)
   Action: wretched(object_4, object_10, object_8, object_2)
   Preconditions checked (all true at t=0):
     - sneeze object_4
     - texture object_10
     - texture object_8
     - stupendous object_2
     - next object_4 object_10
     - collect object_10 object_2
     - collect object_8 object_2
   Effects (applied at end of step):
     - add next object_4 object_8
     - delete next object_4 object_10
   Outcome after step: object_4 now points next to object_8 (instead of object_10).

2) t=1 → t=2 (duration 1)
   Action: clip(object_11, object_4, object_8)
   Preconditions checked (true at t=1, using effect of step 1):
     - hand object_11
     - sneeze object_4
     - texture object_8
     - next object_4 object_8  (created by step 1)
     - next object_11 object_8 (present in initial state)
   Effects (applied at end of step):
     - add vase object_11 object_4
     - delete next object_11 object_8
   Outcome after step: object_11 no longer points next to object_8; object_11 has vase relation with object_4.

3) t=2 → t=3 (duration 1)
   Action: wretched(object_4, object_8, object_9, object_2)
   Preconditions checked (true at t=2):
     - sneeze object_4
     - texture object_8
     - texture object_9
     - stupendous object_2
     - next object_4 object_8  (still true after step 1; step 2 did not change this)
     - collect object_8 object_2
     - collect object_9 object_2
   Effects (applied at end of step):
     - add next object_4 object_9
     - delete next object_4 object_8
   Outcome after step: object_4 now points next to object_9.

4) t=3 → t=4 (duration 1)
   Action: tightfisted(object_11, object_4, object_9)
   Preconditions checked (true at t=3):
     - hand object_11
     - sneeze object_4
     - texture object_9
     - next object_4 object_9  (created by step 3)
     - vase object_11 object_4  (created by step 2)
   Effects (applied at end of step):
     - add next object_11 object_9
     - delete vase object_11 object_4
   Outcome after step: object_11 now points next to object_9.

Final state check (t=4):
 - Goal (next object_11 object_9) is achieved.

Total plan length: 4 actions, total duration (as reported) 4 time units.
