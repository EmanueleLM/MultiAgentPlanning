1) Time 0 — 1 (duration 1)
Action: memory(object_0, object_6, object_5)
Meaning: Move the "next" pointer for object_0 from object_6 to object_5.
Preconditions checked before the action:
- cats object_0 (true in init)
- spring object_6 (true in init)
- spring object_5 (true in init)
- next object_0 object_6 (true in init)
Effects (applied at end of step):
- add next object_0 object_5
- remove next object_0 object_6

2) Time 1 — 2 (duration 1)
Action: sip(object_8, object_0, object_5)
Meaning: Using object_8 and object_0 with reference to object_5, create a vase relation between object_8 and object_0 and remove object_8's "next" link to object_5.
Preconditions checked before the action:
- hand object_8 (true in init)
- cats object_0 (true in init)
- texture object_5 (true in init)
- next object_8 object_5 (true in init)
- next object_0 object_5 (true after step 1)
Effects (applied at end of step):
- add vase object_8 object_0
- remove next object_8 object_5

3) Time 2 — 3 (duration 1)
Action: memory(object_0, object_5, object_6)
Meaning: Move the "next" pointer for object_0 back from object_5 to object_6.
Preconditions checked before the action:
- cats object_0 (true)
- spring object_5 (true in init)
- spring object_6 (true in init)
- next object_0 object_5 (true after step 1, and restored by step 1/unchanged except sip did not touch it)
Effects (applied at end of step):
- add next object_0 object_6
- remove next object_0 object_5

4) Time 3 — 4 (duration 1)
Action: paltry(object_8, object_0, object_6)
Meaning: Using object_8 and object_0 with reference to object_6, set object_8's "next" link to object_6 and remove the vase relation between object_8 and object_0.
Preconditions checked before the action:
- hand object_8 (true)
- cats object_0 (true)
- texture object_6 (true)
- vase object_8 object_0 (created in step 2)
- next object_0 object_6 (restored in step 3)
Effects (applied at end of step):
- add next object_8 object_6
- remove vase object_8 object_0

Summary:
- Total plan cost / total duration: 4 (four unit-duration actions).
- Final relevant facts include next object_7 object_6 (unchanged from init) and next object_8 object_6 (established in step 4). Both goal conjuncts (next object_7 object_6 and next object_8 object_6) are satisfied.
