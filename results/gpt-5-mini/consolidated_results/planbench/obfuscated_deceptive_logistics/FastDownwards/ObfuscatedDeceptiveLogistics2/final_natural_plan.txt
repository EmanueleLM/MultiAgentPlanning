Below is a clear, step-by-step, human-readable trace of the provided PDDL plan. Each step lists the action name, the time transition (current-time before -> after), the concrete object parameters, the required preconditions at that time, the effects (which atomic facts are added and which are removed), and a short resulting-state note. Each action advances time by one discrete succ step (duration = 1).

Initial relevant facts (from the problem init, time = t0)
- current-time: t0
- next: (object_0 object_6), (object_3 object_5), (object_4 object_6), (object_7 object_6), (object_8 object_6)
- hand: object_7, object_8
- cats: object_0
- texture: object_5, object_6
- spring: object_5, object_6
- stupendous: object_1, object_2
- collect: (object_5 object_1), (object_6 object_2)
- sneeze: object_3, object_4
- (No vase relations initially)

Step 1
- Action: sip t0 -> t1  | sip t0 t1 object_7 object_0 object_6
- Duration: 1 succ step (t0 to t1)
- Parameters: o0=object_7, o1=object_0, o2=object_6
- Preconditions required at t0:
  - current-time t0
  - succ t0 t1
  - hand object_7
  - cats object_0
  - texture object_6
  - next object_7 object_6
  - next object_0 object_6
  (All satisfied by the initial state.)
- Effects (applied at t1):
  - Add: vase object_7 object_0
  - Remove: next object_7 object_6
  - Advance current-time: remove current-time t0, add current-time t1
- Resulting relevant facts after step 1 (time = t1):
  - next: (object_0 object_6), (object_3 object_5), (object_4 object_6), (object_8 object_6)  [object_7->object_6 removed]
  - vase: (object_7 object_0)

Step 2
- Action: sip t1 -> t2  | sip t1 t2 object_8 object_0 object_6
- Duration: 1 succ step (t1 to t2)
- Parameters: o0=object_8, o1=object_0, o2=object_6
- Preconditions required at t1:
  - current-time t1
  - succ t1 t2
  - hand object_8
  - cats object_0
  - texture object_6
  - next object_8 object_6
  - next object_0 object_6
  (All satisfied after step 1.)
- Effects (applied at t2):
  - Add: vase object_8 object_0
  - Remove: next object_8 object_6
  - Advance current-time: remove current-time t1, add current-time t2
- Resulting relevant facts after step 2 (time = t2):
  - next: (object_0 object_6), (object_3 object_5), (object_4 object_6)  [object_8->object_6 removed]
  - vase: (object_7 object_0), (object_8 object_0)

Step 3
- Action: memory t2 -> t3  | memory t2 t3 object_0 object_6 object_5
- Duration: 1 succ step (t2 to t3)
- Parameters: o0=object_0, o1=object_6, o2=object_5
- Preconditions required at t2:
  - current-time t2
  - succ t2 t3
  - cats object_0
  - spring object_6
  - spring object_5
  - next object_0 object_6
  (All satisfied: next object_0 object_6 remained from init; spring and cats were in init.)
- Effects (applied at t3):
  - Add: next object_0 object_5
  - Remove: next object_0 object_6
  - Advance current-time: remove current-time t2, add current-time t3
- Resulting relevant facts after step 3 (time = t3):
  - next: (object_0 object_5), (object_3 object_5), (object_4 object_6)
  - vase: (object_7 object_0), (object_8 object_0)

Step 4
- Action: paltry t3 -> t4  | paltry t3 t4 object_7 object_0 object_5
- Duration: 1 succ step (t3 to t4)
- Parameters: o0=object_7, o1=object_0, o2=object_5
- Preconditions required at t3:
  - current-time t3
  - succ t3 t4
  - hand object_7
  - cats object_0
  - texture object_5
  - vase object_7 object_0
  - next object_0 object_5
  (All satisfied: vase created in Step 1, next object_0 object_5 created in Step 3.)
- Effects (applied at t4):
  - Remove: vase object_7 object_0
  - Add: next object_7 object_5
  - Advance current-time: remove current-time t3, add current-time t4
- Resulting relevant facts after step 4 (time = t4):
  - next: (object_0 object_5), (object_3 object_5), (object_4 object_6), (object_7 object_5)
  - vase: (object_8 object_0)  [object_7-object_0 vase removed]

Step 5
- Action: paltry t4 -> t5  | paltry t4 t5 object_8 object_0 object_5
- Duration: 1 succ step (t4 to t5)
- Parameters: o0=object_8, o1=object_0, o2=object_5
- Preconditions required at t4:
  - current-time t4
  - succ t4 t5
  - hand object_8
  - cats object_0
  - texture object_5
  - vase object_8 object_0
  - next object_0 object_5
  (All satisfied: vase object_8 object_0 from Step 2, next object_0 object_5 still present.)
- Effects (applied at t5):
  - Remove: vase object_8 object_0
  - Add: next object_8 object_5
  - Advance current-time: remove current-time t4, add current-time t5
- Resulting relevant facts after step 5 (time = t5):
  - next: (object_0 object_5), (object_3 object_5), (object_4 object_6), (object_7 object_5), (object_8 object_5)
  - vase: (none remaining)

Goal check (after step 5, time = t5)
- Goal required: next object_7 object_5 AND next object_8 object_5
- Achieved: next object_7 object_5 (added in Step 4) and next object_8 object_5 (added in Step 5).
- Plan success: both goal atoms are present at t5.

Notes
- Every step exactly follows the supplied plan actions and order; no actions were added or removed.
- Each action advances the discrete current-time by one succ step (t0→t1→t2→t3→t4→t5).
- The only vase relations created were intermediate bookkeeping that paltry later consumed; final state has no vase facts and the two required next relations are produced.
