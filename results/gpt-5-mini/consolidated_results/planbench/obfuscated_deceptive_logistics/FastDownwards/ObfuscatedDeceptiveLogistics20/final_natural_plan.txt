Step 1 — time 0.0 → 1.0 (duration 1.0, cost 1)
- Action: wretched object_12 object_10 object_11 object_3
- Parameters (natural language): a = object_12, b = object_10, c = object_11, d = object_3

- Preconditions (checked against the initial state; all are true):
  - sneeze object_12
  - texture object_10
  - texture object_11
  - stupendous object_3
  - next object_12 object_10
  - collect object_10 object_3
  - collect object_11 object_3

- What the action does (plain description):
  - Re-route the "next" link for object_12 from object_10 to object_11. In other words, change object_12’s successor: remove next(object_12, object_10) and add next(object_12, object_11).

- Effects (resulting state change):
  - add: next object_12 object_11
  - remove: next object_12 object_10

Outcome:
- The goal (next object_12 object_11) is achieved after this single step.
