Plan timeline (stages s0→s1→s2→s3→s4). Each action consumes the current stage and advances to the next; treat each stage transition as 1 time unit. Initial time t=0 corresponds to curr s0.

1) Time 0 → 1 (duration 1)
   Action: wretched object_4 object_10 object_8 object_2  (s0 -> s1)
   - Semantics (parameters): o0=object_4, o1=object_10, o2=object_8, o3=object_2
   - Required preconditions at start (all satisfied in the initial state):
     • (sneeze object_4) — true
     • (texture object_10) — true
     • (texture object_8) — true
     • (stupendous object_2) — true
     • (next object_4 object_10) — true
     • (collect object_10 object_2) — true
     • (collect object_8 object_2) — true
     • (curr s0) — true
   - Effects applied at end of step:
     • Added: (next object_4 object_8)
     • Removed: (next object_4 object_10)
     • Stage: (curr s0) removed, (curr s1) added
   - State change summary: object_4's next-link moves from object_10 to object_8.

2) Time 1 → 2 (duration 1)
   Action: clip object_11 object_4 object_8  (s1 -> s2)
   - Semantics: h=object_11, sneeze=object_4, t=object_8
   - Required preconditions at start (all satisfied after step 1):
     • (hand object_11) — true (initial)
     • (sneeze object_4) — true (initial)
     • (texture object_8) — true (initial)
     • (next object_4 object_8) — true (added by step 1)
     • (next object_11 object_8) — true (initial)
     • (curr s1) — true
   - Effects applied at end of step:
     • Added: (vase object_11 object_4)
     • Removed: (next object_11 object_8)
     • Stage: (curr s1) removed, (curr s2) added
   - State change summary: a vase relation is created between object_11 and object_4; object_11 no longer points to object_8.

3) Time 2 → 3 (duration 1)
   Action: wretched object_4 object_8 object_9 object_2  (s2 -> s3)
   - Semantics: o0=object_4, o1=object_8, o2=object_9, o3=object_2
   - Required preconditions at start (all satisfied after step 2):
     • (sneeze object_4) — true
     • (texture object_8) — true
     • (texture object_9) — true
     • (stupendous object_2) — true
     • (next object_4 object_8) — true (still true after step 1; not removed by step 2)
     • (collect object_8 object_2) — true (initial)
     • (collect object_9 object_2) — true (initial)
     • (curr s2) — true
   - Effects applied at end of step:
     • Added: (next object_4 object_9)
     • Removed: (next object_4 object_8)
     • Stage: (curr s2) removed, (curr s3) added
   - State change summary: object_4's next-link moves from object_8 to object_9.

4) Time 3 → 4 (duration 1)
   Action: tightfisted object_11 object_4 object_9  (s3 -> s4)
   - Semantics: h=object_11, sneeze=object_4, t=object_9
   - Required preconditions at start (all satisfied after step 3):
     • (hand object_11) — true
     • (sneeze object_4) — true
     • (texture object_9) — true
     • (next object_4 object_9) — true (added by step 3)
     • (vase object_11 object_4) — true (added by step 2)
     • (curr s3) — true
   - Effects applied at end of step:
     • Added: (next object_11 object_9)
     • Removed: (vase object_11 object_4)
     • Stage: (curr s3) removed, (curr s4) added
   - State change summary: object_11 now points to object_9; the vase relation between object_11 and object_4 is consumed.

Final check (after time 4)
- The goal (next object_11 object_9) is true (added by step 4).
- All actions in the provided plan were executed in order, each precondition was satisfied at its step, and effects were applied as specified.
- Total plan length: 4 actions (each 1 time unit), final stage curr s4.
