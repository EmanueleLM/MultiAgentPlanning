Plan (human-readable sequence, matching the provided PDDL plan exactly)

Step 1 — paltry object_12 object_0 object_5 (stage_0 → stage_1)
- Timestamp / stage: executed while current-stage = stage_0; after execution current-stage = stage_1 (discrete timestamp advance: t=0 → t=1).
- Action parameters:
  - h = object_12
  - c = object_0
  - t = object_5
- Preconditions (all satisfied at t=0):
  - (hand object_12) — true in the initial state
  - (cats object_0) — true in the initial state
  - (texture object_5) — true in the initial state
  - (vase object_12 object_0) — provided in the problem’s initial facts
  - (next object_0 object_5) — true in the initial state
  - (current-stage stage_0) and (succ stage_0 stage_1) — present in the problem
- Effects applied at execution:
  - Add: (next object_12 object_5) — this makes the goal conjunct (next object_12 object_5) true
  - Delete: (vase object_12 object_0)
  - Advance stage: unset (current-stage stage_0), set (current-stage stage_1)
- Resulting notable facts after Step 1:
  - (next object_12 object_5) is true
  - (vase object_12 object_0) is removed
  - current stage is stage_1

Step 2 — paltry object_11 object_0 object_7 (stage_1 → stage_2)
- Timestamp / stage: executed while current-stage = stage_1; after execution current-stage = stage_2 (t=1 → t=2).
- Action parameters:
  - h = object_11
  - c = object_0
  - t = object_7
- Preconditions (all satisfied at t=1):
  - (hand object_11) — true in the initial state
  - (cats object_0) — true in the initial state
  - (texture object_7) — true in the initial state
  - (vase object_11 object_0) — provided in the problem’s initial facts
  - (next object_0 object_7) — provided in the problem’s initial facts
  - (current-stage stage_1) and (succ stage_1 stage_2) — stage_1 was set by Step 1 and succ exists
- Effects applied at execution:
  - Add: (next object_11 object_7) — this makes the goal conjunct (next object_11 object_7) true
  - Delete: (vase object_11 object_0)
  - Advance stage: unset (current-stage stage_1), set (current-stage stage_2)
- Resulting notable facts after Step 2:
  - (next object_11 object_7) is true
  - (vase object_11 object_0) is removed
  - current stage is stage_2

Goal check (after Step 2)
- Required goal: (next object_11 object_7) and (next object_12 object_5)
- Both are true in the final state. The plan succeeds.

Plan length/cost: 2 actions (unit cost per action, total cost = 2).
