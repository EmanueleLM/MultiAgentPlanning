Summary of relevant initial facts (t0):
- hand: object_11, object_12
- sneeze: object_3, object_4
- texture: object_5, object_6, object_7, object_8, object_9, object_10
- collect: (object_10,object_2), (object_5,object_1), (object_6,object_1), (object_7,object_1), (object_8,object_2), (object_9,object_2)
- stupendous: object_1, object_2
- cats/spring etc. (not used in these steps)
- next relations: next(object_0,object_8), next(object_11,object_6), next(object_12,object_10), next(object_3,object_7), next(object_4,object_10), next(object_4,object_10)

Plan (each action 1 time unit; timestamps shown as [start — end]):

1) [t=0 — t=1] clip object_12 object_4 object_10
- Action: clip(h=object_12, sneezeObj=object_4, t=object_10)
- Preconditions satisfied at t0: hand(object_12), sneeze(object_4), texture(object_10), next(object_4,object_10), next(object_12,object_10)
- Effects:
  - Delete: next(object_12,object_10)
  - Add: vase(object_12,object_4)
- State consequence: object_12 no longer points to object_10; object_12 now holds a vase relation with object_4.

2) [t=1 — t=2] wretched object_4 object_10 object_8 object_2
- Action: wretched(x=object_4, y=object_10, z=object_8, stup=object_2)
- Preconditions at t1: sneeze(object_4), texture(object_10), texture(object_8), stupendous(object_2), next(object_4,object_10), collect(object_10,object_2), collect(object_8,object_2)
- Effects:
  - Delete: next(object_4,object_10)
  - Add: next(object_4,object_8)
- State consequence: object_4’s "next" target changes from object_10 to object_8.

3) [t=2 — t=3] tightfisted object_12 object_4 object_8
- Action: tightfisted(h=object_12, sneezeObj=object_4, t=object_8)
- Preconditions at t2: hand(object_12), sneeze(object_4), texture(object_8), next(object_4,object_8), vase(object_12,object_4)
- Effects:
  - Delete: vase(object_12,object_4)
  - Add: next(object_12,object_8)
- State consequence: object_12 now points to object_8 (next(object_12,object_8) — this satisfies goal condition for object_12).

4) [t=3 — t=4] wretched object_3 object_7 object_6 object_1
- Action: wretched(x=object_3, y=object_7, z=object_6, stup=object_1)
- Preconditions at t3: sneeze(object_3), texture(object_7), texture(object_6), stupendous(object_1), next(object_3,object_7), collect(object_7,object_1), collect(object_6,object_1)
- Effects:
  - Delete: next(object_3,object_7)
  - Add: next(object_3,object_6)
- State consequence: object_3’s "next" target changes from object_7 to object_6.

5) [t=4 — t=5] clip object_11 object_3 object_6
- Action: clip(h=object_11, sneezeObj=object_3, t=object_6)
- Preconditions at t4: hand(object_11), sneeze(object_3), texture(object_6), next(object_3,object_6), next(object_11,object_6)
- Effects:
  - Delete: next(object_11,object_6)
  - Add: vase(object_11,object_3)
- State consequence: object_11 temporarily loses its "next" to object_6 and acquires vase(object_11,object_3).

6) [t=5 — t=6] wretched object_3 object_6 object_7 object_1
- Action: wretched(x=object_3, y=object_6, z=object_7, stup=object_1)
- Preconditions at t5: sneeze(object_3), texture(object_6), texture(object_7), stupendous(object_1), next(object_3,object_6), collect(object_6,object_1), collect(object_7,object_1)
- Effects:
  - Delete: next(object_3,object_6)
  - Add: next(object_3,object_7)
- State consequence: object_3’s "next" target changes from object_6 back to object_7 (restoring the relation that clip required next(object_3,object_7) for the next step).

7) [t=6 — t=7] tightfisted object_11 object_3 object_7
- Action: tightfisted(h=object_11, sneezeObj=object_3, t=object_7)
- Preconditions at t6: hand(object_11), sneeze(object_3), texture(object_7), next(object_3,object_7), vase(object_11,object_3)
- Effects:
  - Delete: vase(object_11,object_3)
  - Add: next(object_11,object_7)
- State consequence: object_11 now points to object_7 (next(object_11,object_7) — this satisfies goal condition for object_11).

Final state (after t=7) relevant to the goal:
- next(object_11,object_7) — achieved
- next(object_12,object_8) — achieved

Total plan duration: 7 time units (each step 1 unit). The sequence above exactly matches the provided plan steps and shows the preconditions and postconditions that lead to the two goal next-relations.
