Below is a step-by-step, human-readable rendering of the given PDDL plan. Each step matches the plan exactly (no steps added or removed). For each action I show: the action name and its object arguments, the explicit preconditions that must hold at that time, the explicit effects (what is added and what is deleted), and the stage/time transition. I treat each stage-successor transition as one time unit (duration = 1).

Step 1 — time stage_0 → stage_1 (t = 0 → 1), duration 1

  - Add: (next object_0 object_5)
  - Delete: (next object_0 object_8)

- Total steps/actions: 16 (each 1 time unit), final stage = stage_16.

If you want, I can also present these same steps in a more compact timeline table or map each precondition-effect to the initial facts that enabled it.
