Below is a clear, step-by-step human-readable trace of the provided plan. Each step lists:
- the action name and its concrete parameters (with their types implied by the problem file),
- the logical timestamp as the phase consumed -> phase produced (useful as a unit-duration timestamp),
- the key preconditions that made the action applicable at that time (stating whether they came from the initial state or were produced earlier),
- the effects (what predicates were added and what predicates were deleted),
- and when each goal atom is achieved.

All 16 actions are presented in the same order as the plan; no actions were added or removed. Each action is assumed to take one phase-step (duration = 1 phase unit), consistent with the at-phase / phase-succ bookkeeping in the domain.

- next object_13 object_10 — achieved in Step 16.

Summary:
- The plan is a sequence of 16 actions, each consuming one phase and producing the next phase (phase_0 -> phase_16 in total).
- The three required goal relations (next object_11 object_8, next object_12 object_8, next object_13 object_10) are produced by Steps 11, 8, and 16 respectively; therefore the final goal is satisfied by this action sequence.
- All preconditions used in each step are either initial facts explicitly given in Episode A or effects created by previous steps in this same plan, consistent with the provided domain and problem.
