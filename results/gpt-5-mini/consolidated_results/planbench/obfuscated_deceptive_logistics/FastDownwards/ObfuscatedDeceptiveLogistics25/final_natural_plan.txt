Plan (human-readable sequence, matching the supplied PDDL plan exactly):

1) Step 1 — Action: memory(object_11, object_10, object_5)  
   - Timestamp: executes at step0 and completes at step1 (duration: 1 time step)  
   - Preconditions checked at step0:
     - (cats object_11) — true in init
     - (spring object_10) — true in init
     - (spring object_5)  — true in init
     - (next object_11 object_10) — true in init
     - (now step0) — initial time
   - Effects when action completes (at step1):
     - Add: (next object_11 object_5)
     - Delete: (next object_11 object_10)
     - Time: (now step0) removed, (now step1) added
   - Resulting relevant facts after this step: next(object_11, object_5) now holds.

2) Step 2 — Action: memory(object_12, object_7, object_9)  
   - Timestamp: executes at step1 and completes at step2 (duration: 1 time step)  
   - Preconditions checked at step1:
     - (cats object_12) — true in init
     - (spring object_7)  — true in init
     - (spring object_9)  — true in init
     - (next object_12 object_7) — true in init
     - (now step1) — set by previous action
   - Effects when action completes (at step2):
     - Add: (next object_12 object_9)
     - Delete: (next object_12 object_7)
     - Time: (now step1) removed, (now step2) added
   - Resulting relevant facts after this step: next(object_12, object_9) now holds.

3) Step 3 — Action: memory(object_13, object_7, object_10)  
   - Timestamp: executes at step2 and completes at step3 (duration: 1 time step)  
   - Preconditions checked at step2:
     - (cats object_13) — true in init
     - (spring object_7)  — true in init
     - (spring object_10) — true in init
     - (next object_13 object_7) — true in init
     - (now step2) — set by previous action
   - Effects when action completes (at step3):
     - Add: (next object_13 object_10)
     - Delete: (next object_13 object_7)
     - Time: (now step2) removed, (now step3) added
   - Resulting relevant facts after this step: next(object_13, object_10) now holds.

Final state check (after step3): the goal is satisfied:
- (next object_11 object_5) — achieved by step 1
- (next object_12 object_9) — achieved by step 2
- (next object_13 object_10) — achieved by step 3

Total cost: 3 actions (as in the plan).
