Summary: execute the three planned "memory" actions in sequence. Each action takes the plan from one stage to the next (s0→s1→s2→s3). I list each step with time window, the action instantiation used, the causal preconditions checked, and the direct effects. No bookkeeping tokens or extra actions are introduced. Total plan cost = 3 (one unit per action); total duration = 3 time units.

Step 1 — time 0.0 → 1.0 (duration 1)
- Action: memory object_12 object_11 object_6 (consumes stage s0, produces stage s1)
- Preconditions checked (all true at time 0):
  - cats object_12
  - spring object_11
  - spring object_6
  - next object_12 object_11
  - stage-available s0
- Effects (applied at time 1.0):
  - Add next object_12 object_6
  - Delete next object_12 object_11
  - Consume stage-available s0; make stage-available s1
- Purpose: replace the current next link object_12→object_11 with object_12→object_6, advancing the stage.

Step 2 — time 1.0 → 2.0 (duration 1)
- Action: memory object_13 object_8 object_10 (consumes stage s1, produces stage s2)
- Preconditions checked (all true at time 1):
  - cats object_13
  - spring object_8
  - spring object_10
  - next object_13 object_8
  - stage-available s1
- Effects (applied at time 2.0):
  - Add next object_13 object_10
  - Delete next object_13 object_8
  - Consume stage-available s1; make stage-available s2
- Purpose: replace next link object_13→object_8 with object_13→object_10, advancing the stage.

Step 3 — time 2.0 → 3.0 (duration 1)
- Action: memory object_14 object_8 object_11 (consumes stage s2, produces stage s3)
- Preconditions checked (all true at time 2):
  - cats object_14
  - spring object_8
  - spring object_11
  - next object_14 object_8
  - stage-available s2
- Effects (applied at time 3.0):
  - Add next object_14 object_11
  - Delete next object_14 object_8
  - Consume stage-available s2; make stage-available s3
- Purpose: replace next link object_14→object_8 with object_14→object_11, advancing the stage.

Goal attainment (at time 3.0)
- The goal facts are achieved:
  - next object_12 object_6 (established at Step 1)
  - next object_13 object_10 (established at Step 2)
  - next object_14 object_11 (established at Step 3)

Notes / assumptions explicitly used
- All preconditions listed above are present in the problem initial state (including the supplementary springs and cats declared in the problem).
- Each action uses the stage-available/succ mechanism to serialize steps; I assume unit time per memory action (consistent with plan cost = 3). No ad-hoc bookkeeping devices were introduced; every effect and precondition cited is an explicit predicate from the domain/problem.
