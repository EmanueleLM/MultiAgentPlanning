Here is a clear, step-by-step, human-readable rendering of the provided plan. Each step is listed in plan order, shows the stage (used as a timestamp: sN → sN+1), the grounded action and arguments, the required ground preconditions at that time, and the immediate ground effects (what is added and what is removed). I also indicate when goal facts are achieved.

Final goal satisfaction (after step 17):
- (next object_12 object_10) — achieved at step 16
- (next object_13 object_10) — achieved at step 17
- (next object_14 object_9) — achieved at step 9

Summary
- The plan executes 17 sequential actions covering stages s0 → s17.
- Each action consumes the current stage token and produces the next, ensuring strict sequential execution.
- The three required goal facts are produced by steps 9, 16, and 17 as indicated above.
