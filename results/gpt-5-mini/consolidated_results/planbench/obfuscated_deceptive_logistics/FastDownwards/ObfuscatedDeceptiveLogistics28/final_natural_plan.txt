1) Time 0.0 → 1.0 (duration 1.0)
   Action: analyze(analyzer1, data1, ph1 → ph2)
   Actor: analyzer1
   Preconditions satisfied before the step: current-phase = ph1, ph1 → ph2 exists, allowed-analyze(ph1), data1 is not yet analyzed.
   Effects produced by the step: analyzed(data1), analysis-done-by(data1, analyzer1), current-phase becomes ph2 (ph1 no longer current).
   Notes: Phase advanced from ph1 to ph2.

2) Time 1.0 → 2.0 (duration 1.0)
   Action: synthesize(synthesizer1, data1, model1, ph2 → ph3)
   Actor: synthesizer1
   Preconditions satisfied before the step: current-phase = ph2, ph2 → ph3 exists, allowed-synthesize(ph2), analyzed(data1) is true, model1 not yet created.
   Effects produced by the step: model-created(model1), model-valid(model1), synthesized-by(model1, synthesizer1), current-phase becomes ph3 (ph2 no longer current).
   Notes: A valid model (model1) is created from data1 and the phase advanced to ph3.

3) Time 2.0 → 3.0 (duration 1.0)
   Action: audit(auditor1, model1, ph3 → ph4)
   Actor: auditor1
   Preconditions satisfied before the step: current-phase = ph3, ph3 → ph4 exists, allowed-audit(ph3), model-created(model1) and model-valid(model1), model1 not yet audited.
   Effects produced by the step: audited(model1), audited-by(model1, auditor1), current-phase becomes ph4 (ph3 no longer current).
   Notes: Model1 is audited and the pipeline advances to the final phase ph4.

4) Time 3.0 → 4.0 (duration 1.0)
   Action: deliver(orchestrator1, model1, ph4)
   Actor: orchestrator1
   Preconditions satisfied before the step: current-phase = ph4, allowed-deliver(ph4), audited(model1), model1 not yet delivered.
   Effects produced by the step: delivered(model1).
   Notes: Delivery performed in the terminal phase ph4; current-phase remains ph4.

Final state after Time 4.0:
- analyzed(data1) — true
- model-created(model1) — true
- model-valid(model1) — true
- audited(model1) — true
- delivered(model1) — true
- current-phase = ph4
