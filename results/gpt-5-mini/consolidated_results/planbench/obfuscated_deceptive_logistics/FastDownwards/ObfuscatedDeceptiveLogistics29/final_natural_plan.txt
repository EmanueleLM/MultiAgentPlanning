Below is a step-by-step, human-readable trace of the provided PDDL plan. Each step corresponds exactly to one action in the plan, in the same order, with a timestamp (t = integer), a duration (1.0 time unit per step), the instantiated preconditions required immediately before the step, and the deterministic add/delete effects produced by that step. Where relevant I note whether the preconditions come from the initial state or were produced by earlier steps.

Time convention: steps run at integer timestamps t = 0 .. 21, each step duration = 1.0 unit.

Final state (relevant goal predicates achieved):
- (next object_11 object_9) — created at step 7 (t=6)
- (next object_12 object_8) — created at final step 22 (t=21)
- (next object_13 object_5) — created at step 14 (t=13)
- (next object_14 object_7) — created at step 19 (t=18)

These four facts match the problem goal:
  (next object_11 object_9)
  (next object_12 object_8)
  (next object_13 object_5)
  (next object_14 object_7)

Notes:
- Each step above follows the domain action schemata exactly (preconditions/effects shown are the instantiated STRIPS add/delete lists).
- Every precondition required by each action is satisfied either in the initial state or was added by a prior action in the sequence; no infeasible step occurs.
- Each action is presented in the same order and with the same parameters as the original plan.
