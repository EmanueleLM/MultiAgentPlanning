Below is a clear, step-by-step, human-readable trace of the given plan. Each step lists:
- the action and its arguments,
- a timestamp (each action takes 1 time unit; timestamps are integer steps starting at t=0),
- the exact instantiated preconditions required by that action (as given in the domain),
- the concrete effects produced and facts removed (adds / deletes),
- short notes where useful about has-next bookkeeping or why a precondition is satisfied by a prior step.

Step 0 — t = 0 (duration 1)
Action: clip(object_14, object_3, object_5)
Preconditions:
- (hand object_14)
- (sneeze object_3)
- (texture object_5)
- (next object_3 object_5)
- (next object_14 object_5)
Effects (adds / makes true):
- (vase object_14 object_3)
Effects (deletes / makes false):
- (next object_14 object_5)
- (has-next object_14)
Note: clip produces a vase linking object_14 and object_3 and removes object_14's outgoing next (and thus its has-next).

Step 1 — t = 1 (duration 1)
Action: wretched(object_4, object_10, object_8, object_2)
Preconditions:
- (sneeze object_4)
- (texture object_10)
- (texture object_8)
- (stupendous object_2)
- (next object_4 object_10)
- (collect object_10 object_2)
- (collect object_8 object_2)
Effects (adds):
- (next object_4 object_8)
Effects (deletes):
- (next object_4 object_10)
Note: wretched moves object_4's outgoing from object_10 to object_8. has-next for object_4 is preserved (outgoing replaced).

Step 2 — t = 2 (duration 1)
Action: wretched(object_3, object_5, object_6, object_1)
Preconditions:
- (sneeze object_3)
- (texture object_5)
- (texture object_6)
- (stupendous object_1)
- (next object_3 object_5)
- (collect object_5 object_1)
- (collect object_6 object_1)
Effects (adds):
- (next object_3 object_6)
Effects (deletes):
- (next object_3 object_5)
Note: this replaces object_3's outgoing link from object_5 to object_6; has-next remains true for object_3.

Step 3 — t = 3 (duration 1)
Action: clip(object_13, object_3, object_6)
Preconditions:
- (hand object_13)
- (sneeze object_3)
- (texture object_6)
- (next object_3 object_6)
- (next object_13 object_6)
Effects (adds):
- (vase object_13 object_3)
Effects (deletes):
- (next object_13 object_6)
- (has-next object_13)
Note: creates vase(object_13, object_3) and removes object_13's outgoing next/has-next.

Step 4 — t = 4 (duration 1)
Action: clip(object_11, object_3, object_6)
Preconditions:
- (hand object_11)
- (sneeze object_3)
- (texture object_6)
- (next object_3 object_6)
- (next object_11 object_6)
Effects (adds):
- (vase object_11 object_3)
Effects (deletes):
- (next object_11 object_6)
- (has-next object_11)
Note: similar to previous clip, creates vase(object_11,object_3) and removes object_11's outgoing.

Step 5 — t = 5 (duration 1)
Action: sip(object_12, object_0, object_8)
Preconditions:
- (hand object_12)
- (cats object_0)
- (texture object_8)
- (next object_12 object_8)
- (next object_0 object_8)
Effects (adds):
- (vase object_12 object_0)
Effects (deletes):
- (next object_12 object_8)
- (has-next object_12)
Note: sip consumes object_12's outgoing next and produces vase(object_12,object_0). The delete of has-next(object_12) enables later actions that require not(has-next object_12).

Step 6 — t = 6 (duration 1)
Action: memory(object_0, object_8, object_5)
Preconditions:
- (cats object_0)
- (spring object_8)
- (spring object_5)
- (next object_0 object_8)
Effects (adds):
- (next object_0 object_5)
Effects (deletes):
- (next object_0 object_8)
Note: memory moves object_0's outgoing from object_8 to object_5 (has-next preserved).

Step 7 — t = 7 (duration 1)
Action: paltry(object_12, object_0, object_5)
Preconditions:
- (hand object_12)
- (cats object_0)
- (texture object_5)
- (vase object_12 object_0)
- (next object_0 object_5)
- (not (has-next object_12))
Effects (adds):
- (next object_12 object_5)
- (has-next object_12)
Effects (deletes):
- (vase object_12 object_0)
Note: paltry uses vase(object_12,object_0) and existing link next(object_0,object_5) to create next(object_12,object_5). It requires that object_12 currently has no outgoing (not has-next), which was ensured by the sip at step 5.

Step 8 — t = 8 (duration 1)
Action: memory(object_0, object_5, object_8)
Preconditions:
- (cats object_0)
- (spring object_5)
- (spring object_8)
- (next object_0 object_5)
Effects (adds):
- (next object_0 object_8)
Effects (deletes):
- (next object_0 object_5)
Note: memory swaps object_0's outgoing back from object_5 to object_8.

Step 9 — t = 9 (duration 1)
Action: wretched(object_3, object_6, object_5, object_1)
Preconditions:
- (sneeze object_3)
- (texture object_6)
- (texture object_5)

- (next object_3 object_6)
- (collect object_6 object_1)
- (collect object_5 object_1)
Effects (adds):
- (next object_3 object_5)
Effects (deletes):
- (next object_3 object_6)
Note: replaces object_3's outgoing from object_6 back to object_5.

Step 10 — t = 10 (duration 1)
Action: clip(object_12, object_3, object_5)
Preconditions:
- (hand object_12)
- (sneeze object_3)
- (texture object_5)
- (next object_3 object_5)
- (next object_12 object_5)
Effects (adds):
- (vase object_12 object_3)
Effects (deletes):
- (next object_12 object_5)
- (has-next object_12)
Note: creates vase(object_12, object_3) and removes object_12's outgoing next.

Step 11 — t = 11 (duration 1)
Action: tightfisted(object_13, object_3, object_5)
Preconditions:
- (hand object_13)
- (sneeze object_3)
- (texture object_5)
- (next object_3 object_5)
- (vase object_13 object_3)
- (not (has-next object_13))
Effects (adds):
- (next object_13 object_5)
- (has-next object_13)
Effects (deletes):
- (vase object_13 object_3)
Note: tightfisted uses vase(object_13,object_3) (from step 3) and requires object_13 to have no outgoing (true after clip at step 3); it creates next(object_13,object_5).

Step 12 — t = 12 (duration 1)

Preconditions:
- (hand object_11)
- (sneeze object_3)

- (vase object_11 object_3)
- (not (has-next object_11))
Effects (adds):
- (next object_11 object_5)
- (has-next object_11)
Effects (deletes):
- (vase object_11 object_3)
Note: creates next(object_11,object_5) from vase(object_11,object_3) (vase created at step 4), reinstating object_11's outgoing.

Step 13 — t = 13 (duration 1)
Action: wretched(object_3, object_5, object_6, object_1)
Preconditions:
- (sneeze object_3)

- (sneeze object_3)
- (texture object_6)
- (next object_3 object_6)
- (vase object_12 object_3)
- (not (has-next object_12))
Effects (adds):
- (next object_12 object_6)
- (has-next object_12)
Effects (deletes):
- (vase object_12 object_3)
Note: uses vase(object_12,object_3) (created step 10) to put next(object_12,object_6) in place.

- (sneeze object_3)
- (texture object_6)
- (texture object_7)
- (stupendous object_1)
- (next object_3 object_6)
- (collect object_6 object_1)
- (collect object_7 object_1)
Effects (adds):
- (next object_3 object_7)
Effects (deletes):
- (next object_3 object_6)
Note: this moves object_3's outgoing to object_7 (so object_3 -> object_7).

Step 16 — t = 16 (duration 1)
Action: tightfisted(object_14, object_3, object_7)
Preconditions:
- (hand object_14)
- (sneeze object_3)
- (texture object_7)
- (next object_3 object_7)
- (vase object_14 object_3)
- (not (has-next object_14))
Effects (adds):
- (next object_14 object_7)
- (has-next object_14)
Effects (deletes):
- (vase object_14 object_3)
Note: uses vase(object_14,object_3) created at step 0; creates next(object_14,object_7). This achieves the desired goal fact next object_14 object_7.

Step 17 — t = 17 (duration 1)
Action: memory(object_0, object_8, object_5)
Preconditions:
- (cats object_0)
- (spring object_8)
- (spring object_5)
- (next object_0 object_8)
Effects (adds):
- (next object_0 object_5)
Effects (deletes):
- (next object_0 object_8)
Note: another memory invocation swapping object_0's outgoing; repeats the swap done at step 6 and step 8 as required by the plan.

Step 18 — t = 18 (duration 1)
Action: sip(object_13, object_0, object_5)
Preconditions:
- (hand object_13)
- (cats object_0)
- (texture object_5)
- (next object_13 object_5)
- (next object_0 object_5)
Effects (adds):
- (vase object_13 object_0)
Effects (deletes):
- (next object_13 object_5)
- (has-next object_13)
Note: sip consumes object_13's outgoing and produces vase(object_13,object_0).

Step 19 — t = 19 (duration 1)

Preconditions:
- (hand object_11)
- (cats object_0)

- (next object_0 object_5)
Effects (adds):
- (vase object_11 object_0)

Effects (adds):
- (next object_13 object_8)
- (has-next object_13)
Effects (deletes):
- (vase object_13 object_0)
Note: paltry uses vase(object_13,object_0) produced at step 18 to create next(object_13,object_8).

Step 22 — t = 22 (duration 1)
Action: clip(object_13, object_4, object_8)
Preconditions:
- (hand object_13)
- (sneeze object_4)

Effects (adds):
- (vase object_13 object_4)
Effects (deletes):
- (next object_13 object_8)

- (next object_0 object_8)
- (not (has-next object_11))
Effects (adds):
- (next object_11 object_8)
- (has-next object_11)
Effects (deletes):

Effects (adds):
- (next object_13 object_10)
- (has-next object_13)
Effects (deletes):
- (vase object_13 object_4)
Note: tightfisted uses vase(object_13,object_4) created at step 22 to put next(object_13,object_10). This achieves the goal next object_13 object_10.

Step 27 — t = 27 (duration 1)
Action: tightfisted(object_11, object_4, object_10)
Preconditions:
- (hand object_11)
- (sneeze object_4)
- (texture object_10)
- (next object_4 object_10)
- (vase object_11 object_4)
- (not (has-next object_11))
Effects (adds):
- (next object_11 object_10)
- (has-next object_11)
Effects (deletes):
- (vase object_11 object_4)
Note: tightfisted uses vase(object_11,object_4) created at step 24 to create next(object_11,object_10). This achieves the goal next object_11 object_10.

Summary / Goal coverage:
- next(object_11, object_10) was established at Step 27.
- next(object_12, object_6) was established at Step 14 (tightfisted object_12 ... → next object_12 object_6).
- next(object_13, object_10) was established at Step 26.
- next(object_14, object_7) was established at Step 16.

Bookkeeping notes (explicit):
- Actions that create a new outgoing for an object (paltry, tightfisted) add (next ...) and (has-next ...) and consume a vase between the two nodes.
- Actions that consume an outgoing (sip, clip) produce a vase and remove (next ...) and (has-next ...).
- Actions that move an outgoing from one target to another without changing existence of an outgoing (wretched, memory) add the new next(...) and delete the old next(...); has-next for that subject is preserved.
- All preconditions stated above are the exact predicates required by the domain action schemas; where a precondition required "not (has-next X)" the plan ensured that previously (sip or clip) removed has-next before paltry/tightfisted were applied.

This sequence follows the given PDDL plan exactly, lists the instantiated preconditions and effects for each action, and shows how the four goal next relations are reached by the final actions.
