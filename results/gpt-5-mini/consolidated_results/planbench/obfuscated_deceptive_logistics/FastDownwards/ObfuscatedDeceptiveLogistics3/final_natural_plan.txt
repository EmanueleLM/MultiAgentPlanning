Plan (step-by-step, matching the given plan exactly). Each action is 1 time unit long. Timestamps show start time; effects take place immediately at the end of the action.

t = 0 (duration 1)
Action: memory object_1 object_6 object_7
- Preconditions checked before executing:
  - cats(object_1)
  - spring(object_6)
  - spring(object_7)
  - next(object_1, object_6)
- Effects (applied at t = 1):
  - add: next(object_1, object_7)
  - delete: next(object_1, object_6)

t = 1 (duration 1)
Action: sip object_9 object_1 object_7
- Preconditions checked before executing:
  - hand(object_9)
  - cats(object_1)
  - texture(object_7)
  - next(object_9, object_7)
  - next(object_1, object_7)  (this was created by the previous action)
- Effects (applied at t = 2):
  - add: vase(object_9, object_1)
  - delete: next(object_9, object_7)

t = 2 (duration 1)
Action: memory object_1 object_7 object_6
- Preconditions checked before executing:
  - cats(object_1)
  - spring(object_7)
  - spring(object_6)
  - next(object_1, object_7)  (exists because of the first memory action)
- Effects (applied at t = 3):
  - add: next(object_1, object_6)
  - delete: next(object_1, object_7)

t = 3 (duration 1)
Action: paltry object_9 object_1 object_6
- Preconditions checked before executing:
  - hand(object_9)
  - cats(object_1)
  - texture(object_6)
  - vase(object_9, object_1)    (created by sip at t=2)
  - next(object_1, object_6)    (restored by memory at t=3)
- Effects (applied at t = 4):
  - add: next(object_9, object_6)
  - delete: vase(object_9, object_1)

Final state check (after t = 4)
- Goal predicates:
  - next(object_8, object_7) — still true (it was true initially and never deleted).
  - next(object_9, object_6) — added by paltry at t = 4.
- Both goal conditions are satisfied.

Total plan cost: 4 actions (unit cost per action).
