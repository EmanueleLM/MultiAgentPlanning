Plan (unit time per action; timestamps in seconds)

Initial relevant facts (from the problem)
- (hand object_9)
- (sneeze object_4)
- (texture object_7)
- (texture object_8)
- (next object_4 object_7)
- (next object_9 object_7)
- (collect object_7 object_2)
- (collect object_8 object_2)
- (stupendous object_2)

Step 1 — t = 0.0 → 1.0
Action: clip object_9 object_4 object_7
- Preconditions required (checked at t=0.0):
  - (hand object_9) — true
  - (sneeze object_4) — true
  - (texture object_7) — true
  - (next object_4 object_7) — true
  - (next object_9 object_7) — true
- Effects applied at t=1.0:
  - Add: (vase object_9 object_4)
  - Delete: (next object_9 object_7)
- State change summary: object_9 forms a vase relation with object_4; object_9 is no longer immediately successor of object_7.

Step 2 — t = 1.0 → 2.0
Action: wretched object_4 object_7 object_8 object_2
- Preconditions required (checked at t=1.0):
  - (sneeze object_4) — true
  - (texture object_7) — true
  - (texture object_8) — true
  - (stupendous object_2) — true
  - (next object_4 object_7) — true (still true after Step 1)
  - (collect object_7 object_2) — true
  - (collect object_8 object_2) — true
- Effects applied at t=2.0:
  - Add: (next object_4 object_8)
  - Delete: (next object_4 object_7)
- State change summary: object_4's successor is advanced from object_7 to object_8.

Step 3 — t = 2.0 → 3.0
Action: tightfisted object_9 object_4 object_8
- Preconditions required (checked at t=2.0):
  - (hand object_9) — true
  - (sneeze object_4) — true
  - (texture object_8) — true
  - (next object_4 object_8) — true (created in Step 2)
  - (vase object_9 object_4) — true (created in Step 1)
- Effects applied at t=3.0:
  - Add: (next object_9 object_8)
  - Delete: (vase object_9 object_4)
- State change summary: object_9 becomes the immediate successor of object_8 (goal achieved); the vase relation between object_9 and object_4 is removed.

Goal check (after t = 3.0)
- Goal predicate (next object_9 object_8) is true. Goal achieved.
Total plan cost (unit cost per action): 3.
