Summary: the following 7-step execution follows the provided plan exactly (each step takes 1 time unit). I report the action name, the concrete parameter bindings, the stage/time, the main preconditions that must hold, and the primary effects (what is added and what is deleted). After step 7 the goal (next object_9 object_7) is achieved.

Step 1 — time t=0..1
Action: wretched(object_3, object_5, object_6, object_1)  [stage: stage_0 -> stage_1]
Main preconditions checked:
- (sneeze object_3)
- (texture object_5)
- (texture object_6)
- (stupendous object_1)
- (next object_3 object_5)
- (collect object_5 object_1)
- (collect object_6 object_1)
- current-stage = stage_0 (succ stage_0 stage_1)
Effects:
- Added: (next object_3 object_6)
- Deleted: (next object_3 object_5)
- Stage advanced: current-stage becomes stage_1

Step 2 — time t=1..2
Action: clip(object_9, object_3, object_6)  [stage: stage_1 -> stage_2]
Main preconditions checked:
- (hand object_9)
- (sneeze object_3)
- (texture object_6)
- (next object_3 object_6)  (created in Step 1)
- (next object_9 object_6)  (initially present)
- current-stage = stage_1 (succ stage_1 stage_2)
Effects:
- Added: (vase object_9 object_3)
- Deleted: (next object_9 object_6)
- Stage advanced: current-stage becomes stage_2

Step 3 — time t=2..3
Action: wretched(object_3, object_6, object_5, object_1)  [stage: stage_2 -> stage_3]
Main preconditions checked:
- (sneeze object_3)
- (texture object_6)
- (texture object_5)
- (stupendous object_1)
- (next object_3 object_6)  (present from Step 1, not yet deleted by Step 2’s effects on that pair)
- (collect object_6 object_1)
- (collect object_5 object_1)
- current-stage = stage_2 (succ stage_2 stage_3)
Effects:
- Added: (next object_3 object_5)
- Deleted: (next object_3 object_6)
- Stage advanced: current-stage becomes stage_3

Step 4 — time t=3..4
Action: tightfisted(object_9, object_3, object_5)  [stage: stage_3 -> stage_4]
Main preconditions checked:
- (hand object_9)
- (sneeze object_3)
- (texture object_5)
- (next object_3 object_5)  (created in Step 3)
- (vase object_9 object_3)  (created in Step 2)
- current-stage = stage_3 (succ stage_3 stage_4)
Effects:
- Added: (next object_9 object_5)
- Deleted: (vase object_9 object_3)
- Stage advanced: current-stage becomes stage_4

Step 5 — time t=4..5
Action: sip(object_9, object_0, object_5)  [stage: stage_4 -> stage_5]
Main preconditions checked:
- (hand object_9)
- (cats object_0)
- (texture object_5)
- (next object_9 object_5)  (created in Step 4)
- (next object_0 object_5)  (initially present)
- current-stage = stage_4 (succ stage_4 stage_5)
Effects:
- Added: (vase object_9 object_0)
- Deleted: (next object_9 object_5)
- Stage advanced: current-stage becomes stage_5

Step 6 — time t=5..6
Action: memory(object_0, object_5, object_7)  [stage: stage_5 -> stage_6]
Main preconditions checked:
- (cats object_0)
- (spring object_5)
- (spring object_7)
- (next object_0 object_5)  (still present; not deleted before this step)
- current-stage = stage_5 (succ stage_5 stage_6)
Effects:
- Added: (next object_0 object_7)
- Deleted: (next object_0 object_5)
- Stage advanced: current-stage becomes stage_6

Step 7 — time t=6..7
Action: paltry(object_9, object_0, object_7)  [stage: stage_6 -> stage_7]
Main preconditions checked:
- (hand object_9)
- (cats object_0)
- (texture object_7)
- (vase object_9 object_0)  (created in Step 5)
- (next object_0 object_7)  (created in Step 6)
- current-stage = stage_6 (succ stage_6 stage_7)
Effects:
- Added: (next object_9 object_7)   ← Goal achieved
- Deleted: (vase object_9 object_0)
- Stage advanced: current-stage becomes stage_7

Outcome:
- At the end of Step 7 (time t=7) the goal fact (next object_9 object_7) holds, as required. Total plan cost = 7 (7 unit steps).
