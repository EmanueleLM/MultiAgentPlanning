Planned action sequence (each step exactly as in the provided plan). Each step shows timestamp (start→end), duration (1 time unit), applicable preconditions, effects, and the immediate state changes.

Step 1 — clip(object_9, object_4, object_7)  
- Time: 0 → 1 (duration 1) — stage transition stage_0 → stage_1  
- Preconditions checked (all true at time 0):
  - hand(object_9)
  - sneeze(object_4)
  - texture(object_7)
  - next(object_4, object_7)
  - next(object_9, object_7)
  - current(stage_0) and succ(stage_0, stage_1)
- Effects applied at time 1:
  - Add: vase(object_9, object_4)
  - Delete: next(object_9, object_7)
  - Advance current stage: current(stage_0) removed, current(stage_1) added
- Resulting notable facts after Step 1:
  - next(object_9, object_7) is removed
  - vase(object_9, object_4) is present
  - current = stage_1

Step 2 — wretched(object_4, object_7, object_8, object_2)  
- Time: 1 → 2 (duration 1) — stage transition stage_1 → stage_2  
- Preconditions checked (all true at time 1):
  - sneeze(object_4)
  - texture(object_7)
  - texture(object_8)
  - stupendous(object_2)
  - next(object_4, object_7) (remained true after Step 1)
  - collect(object_7, object_2)
  - collect(object_8, object_2)
  - current(stage_1) and succ(stage_1, stage_2)
- Effects applied at time 2:
  - Add: next(object_4, object_8)
  - Delete: next(object_4, object_7)
  - Advance current stage: current(stage_1) removed, current(stage_2) added
- Resulting notable facts after Step 2:
  - next(object_4, object_7) is removed
  - next(object_4, object_8) is present
  - current = stage_2

Step 3 — tightfisted(object_9, object_4, object_8)  
- Time: 2 → 3 (duration 1) — stage transition stage_2 → stage_3  
- Preconditions checked (all true at time 2):
  - hand(object_9)
  - sneeze(object_4)
  - texture(object_8)
  - next(object_4, object_8) (added in Step 2)
  - vase(object_9, object_4) (added in Step 1)
  - current(stage_2) and succ(stage_2, stage_3)
- Effects applied at time 3:
  - Add: next(object_9, object_8)  ← this matches the problem goal
  - Delete: vase(object_9, object_4)
  - Advance current stage: current(stage_2) removed, current(stage_3) added
- Resulting notable facts after Step 3:
  - next(object_9, object_8) is present (goal satisfied)
  - vase(object_9, object_4) removed
  - current = stage_3

Conclusion
- All three actions are applicable in sequence given the initial state and the stage progression constraints.  
- After executing the sequence exactly as given, the goal next(object_9, object_8) holds at time 3.  
- Total plan duration (as reported here): 3 time units.
