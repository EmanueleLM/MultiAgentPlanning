PROBLEM
------------------------------
I am playing with a set of objects. Here are the actions I can do

Paltry object_0 object_1 object_2.
Sip object_0 object_1 object_2.
Clip object_0 object_1 object_2.
Wretched object_0 object_1 object_2 object_3.
Memory object_0 object_1 object_2.
Tightfisted object_0 object_1 object_2.

I have the following restrictions on my actions:
To perform paltry action, the following facts need to be true: hand object_0, cats object_1, texture object_2, vase object_0 object_1, and next object_1 object_2
Once paltry is performed the following facts will be true: next object_0 object_2
Once paltry is performed the following facts will be false: vase object_0 object_1
To perform sip action, the following facts need to be true: hand object_0, cats object_1, texture object_2, next object_0 object_2, and next object_1 object_2
Once sip is performed the following facts will be true: vase object_0 object_1
Once sip is performed the following facts will be false: next object_0 object_2
To perform clip action, the following facts need to be true: hand object_0, sneeze object_1, texture object_2, next object_1 object_2, and next object_0 object_2
Once clip is performed the following facts will be true: vase object_0 object_1
Once clip is performed the following facts will be false: next object_0 object_2
To perform wretched action, the following facts need to be true: sneeze object_0, texture object_1, texture object_2, stupendous object_3, next object_0 object_1, collect object_1 object_3, and collect object_2 object_3
Once wretched is performed the following facts will be true: next object_0 object_2
Once wretched is performed the following facts will be false: next object_0 object_1
To perform memory action, the following facts need to be true: cats object_0, spring object_1, spring object_2, and next object_0 object_1
Once memory is performed the following facts will be true: next object_0 object_2
Once memory is performed the following facts will be false: next object_0 object_1
To perform tightfisted action, the following facts need to be true: hand object_0, sneeze object_1, texture object_2, next object_1 object_2, and vase object_0 object_1
Once tightfisted is performed the following facts will be true: next object_0 object_2
Once tightfisted is performed the following facts will be false: vase object_0 object_1

[STATEMENT]
As initial conditions I have that, cats object_0, cats object_1, collect object_6 object_2, collect object_7 object_3, hand object_8, next object_0 object_7, next object_1 object_7, next object_4 object_6, next object_5 object_7, next object_8 object_7, sneeze object_4, sneeze object_5, spring object_6, spring object_7, stupendous object_2, stupendous object_3, texture object_6 and texture object_7.
My goal is to have that next object_8 object_6.

------------------------------
Plan (3 steps, uses discrete time steps step_0 → step_3):

1) Time: step_0 → step_1 (time interval: step_0 to step_1)
   Action: sip object_8 object_0 object_7
   Parameters: x=object_8, y=object_0, z=object_7
   Preconditions (satisfied at step_0): hand object_8; cats object_0; texture object_7; next object_8 object_7; next object_0 object_7.
   Effects (applied at step_1): add vase object_8 object_0; remove next object_8 object_7.
   Notes: Advances the global time marker from step_0 to step_1.

2) Time: step_1 → step_2 (time interval: step_1 to step_2)
   Action: memory object_0 object_7 object_6
   Parameters: x=object_0, y=object_7, z=object_6
   Preconditions (satisfied at step_1): cats object_0; spring object_7; spring object_6; next object_0 object_7 (this remained true after step 1).
   Effects (applied at step_2): add next object_0 object_6; remove next object_0 object_7.
   Notes: Advances the global time marker from step_1 to step_2.

3) Time: step_2 → step_3 (time interval: step_2 to step_3)
   Action: paltry object_8 object_0 object_6
   Parameters: x=object_8, y=object_0, z=object_6
   Preconditions (satisfied at step_2): hand object_8; cats object_0; texture object_6; vase object_8 object_0 (created by step 1); next object_0 object_6 (created by step 2).
   Effects (applied at step_3): add next object_8 object_6 (goal achieved); remove vase object_8 object_0.
   Notes: Advances the global time marker from step_2 to step_3.

NATURAL-PLAN sas_plan_1
------------------------------
Plan timeline (timestamps in seconds; each action assumed duration = 1.0s). For every step I list: action instance, bound parameters, required preconditions (as taken verbatim from the specification with objects substituted), which of those were true immediately before the action, and the immediate add / delete effects produced by the action.

Initial facts (for reference): 
(cats object_0), (collect object_5 object_1), (collect object_6 object_2), (hand object_7), (hand object_8), (next object_0 object_6), (next object_3 object_5), (next object_4 object_6), (next object_7 object_6), (next object_8 object_5), (sneeze object_3), (sneeze object_4), (spring object_5), (spring object_6), (stupendous object_1), (stupendous object_2), (texture object_5), (texture object_6).

Step 1 — t = 0.0s → 1.0s
- Action: memory(object_0, object_6, object_5)
- Preconditions (from "memory" with parameters substituted):
  1. (cats object_0)
  2. (spring object_6)
  3. (spring object_5)
  4. (next object_0 object_6)
- Were these true immediately before the action? Yes — all four are true in the initial state.
- Immediate effects:
  - Add: (next object_0 object_5)
  - Delete: (not (next object_0 object_6))
- Notes: After this step, next(object_0, object_5) becomes true and next(object_0, object_6) becomes false.

Step 2 — t = 1.0s → 2.0s
- Action: sip(object_8, object_0, object_5)
- Preconditions (from "sip" with parameters substituted):
  1. (hand object_8)
  2. (cats object_0)
  3. (texture object_5)
  4. (next object_8 object_5)
  5. (next object_0 object_5)
- Were these true immediately before the action? Yes.
  - hand object_8 — true (initial)
  - cats object_0 — true (initial)
  - texture object_5 — true (initial)
  - next object_8 object_5 — true (initial)
  - next object_0 object_5 — true (was added by Step 1)
- Immediate effects:
  - Add: (vase object_8 object_0)
  - Delete: (not (next object_8 object_5))
- Notes: This step creates vase(object_8, object_0) and removes next(object_8, object_5). next(object_0, object_5) remains true (it is not deleted by this sip instance).

Step 3 — t = 2.0s → 3.0s
- Action: memory(object_0, object_5, object_6)
- Preconditions (from "memory" with parameters substituted):
  1. (cats object_0)
  2. (spring object_5)
  3. (spring object_6)
  4. (next object_0 object_5)
- Were these true immediately before the action? Yes.
  - cats object_0 — initial
  - spring object_5 — initial
  - spring object_6 — initial
  - next object_0 object_5 — true (added by Step 1 and not deleted by Step 2)
- Immediate effects:
  - Add: (next object_0 object_6)
  - Delete: (not (next object_0 object_5))
- Notes: This restores next(object_0, object_6) and removes next(object_0, object_5).

Step 4 — t = 3.0s → 4.0s
- Action: paltry(object_8, object_0, object_6)
- Preconditions (from "paltry" with parameters substituted):
  1. (hand object_8)
  2. (cats object_0)
  3. (texture object_6)
  4. (vase object_8 object_0)
  5. (next object_0 object_6)
- Were these true immediately before the action? Yes.
  - hand object_8 — initial
  - cats object_0 — initial
  - texture object_6 — initial
  - vase object_8 object_0 — added by Step 2
  - next object_0 object_6 — added by Step 3
- Immediate effects:
  - Add: (next object_8 object_6)
  - Delete: (not (vase object_8 object_0))
- Notes: After this final step, next(object_8, object_6) is true and vase(object_8, object_0) is removed.

Final verification (at t = 4.0s):
- next(object_7, object_6) — was true in the initial state and never deleted → still true.
- next(object_8, object_6) — made true by Step 4.
- Therefore the planning goal (next object_7 object_6) and (next object_8 object_6) is satisfied.

Summary:
- Executed exactly the four actions in the supplied plan, with timestamps and durations (1.0s each).
- All preconditions held when each action was applied.
- Effect traces are shown step-by-step and the final goal is achieved at t = 4.0s.

My plan is as follows:

[PLAN]
================================================================================


FINAL-PLAN
------------------------------
I can produce the requested FastDownward-compatible PDDL domain + problem, but I don’t have the “player analysis”, “planner draft”, or “auditor report” content you referenced. Those agent inputs are required to derive types, objects, actions, initial facts, ordering constraints, observations, plan skeletons, and auditor corrections. I cannot invent objects, resources, or constraints beyond what you provide.

Please paste (or attach) the three inputs. To make integration straightforward and avoid followups, provide them in the structured form below. If you prefer, provide a single combined natural-language description that contains the same information.

Required information (fill each section; explicit lists are best):

1) Domain-level vocabulary
- Agents (names): e.g., alice, bob, drone1
- Object types and object instances (no extra objects): list types and then each object.
  - Example: types: agent, loc, item, phase
  - Objects: agent: alice bob; loc: A B C; item: package1
- Discrete phases/time slots (if any). If present, list all phase objects and indicate successor relations or required ordering.
- Locations and connectivity (if movement): list direct adjacency links if movement is allowed.

2) Actions per agent (planner draft)
For every action that any agent may perform, give:
- Action name (please prefix to keep distinct; I will use that to generate PDDL names)
- Agent who performs it (must be one of the agents above)
- Parameters (types and whether object is fixed)
- Precondition facts (explicit)
- Add effects (facts that become true)
- Delete effects (facts that become false)
- Any ordering constraints or required phase during which the action must occur (if phases exist)
- If you need observations integrated (sensor outcomes), specify observation facts and under what conditions they become true.

If an agent provided a “plan skeleton” (ordered sequence of high-level steps), list it explicitly and indicate whether that ordering must be strict.

3) Initial state (player analysis)
- All ground facts that must be true initially. Include each of:
  - agent locations
  - item locations/status
  - phase/time-slot initial position (e.g., current-phase phase1)
  - any observations already known
  - any predicates representing partial progress of tasks
Do not rely on implicit defaults — list everything true initially; I will assume anything not listed is false.

4) Goals and hard constraints (auditor corrections treated as hard)
- Final required facts (every mandated terminal condition). Example: (package-delivered package1 locC) AND (alice-at locC)
- Any constraints that must never be violated during the plan (safety invariants). Example: “no agent may enter restricted locX”, “item must not be dropped”, “phase ordering must be contiguous”.
- If the spec used language like avoid/earliest/exactly/at most, convert them to absolute constraints. For example:
  - “Exactly one recharge action per agent” → require that for each agent there is a goal fact (recharged agent) and only actions that set (recharged agent) are allowed; or model recharged as a one-time effect with precondition that it hasn't yet happened.
  - “At most 2 uses” → provide explicit counting mechanism by expanding distinct resource objects, or else state them as forbidden sequences. (I can encode counting only if you specify how to represent the constraint as discrete objects.)
If any constraints imply a limit on the number of times something can occur, provide an explicit encoding approach you accept (e.g., create boolean facts per allowed instance).

5) Observations & conditional branches (if any)
- Specify observable facts that may be discovered only after particular actions.
- If plans must branch on observations, describe how many observation outcomes exist and the corresponding facts to be set.
- If you want observations integrated as explicit actions that produce facts deterministically given preconditions, describe them.

6) Auditor corrections and ordering enforcement
- For each correction that changes allowable orderings or forbids simultaneous effects, state the exact ordering required. Example: “Load must complete before Seal may start” → I will add an explicit predicate (loaded item) and make Seal require (loaded item).
- If “no simultaneous effects” is required for certain actions, list the pairs/triples of actions that must not be interleaved. I will enforce by adding pre/post facts that create strict sequencing.

7) Any costs or objective? (optional)
- If there’s no cost objective, I will not include :action-costs. If you need to minimize something, indicate it; then I can add (increase (total-cost) N) effects and include :action-costs in domain requirements. (But you instructed only to include if required.)

8) Example plan skeletons or forbidden plan fragments (optional but helpful)
- If you have an expected plan skeleton, provide it and indicate which steps are mandatory and which are optional.
- If the auditor forbids certain partial plans, list those fragments so I can encode their impossibility.

Once you provide the above, I will produce:
- A PDDL domain file containing: types, predicates (including explicit ordering/phase predicates), and all action definitions using the agent-prefixed names you gave. Requirements will be exactly :strips, :typing, :negative-preconditions (and :action-costs only if you request costs).
- A PDDL problem file containing: objects, initial facts, successor relations for phases/times (if any), and a goal clause that explicitly includes every mandated terminal condition. All auditor constraints will be enforced so violating plans are impossible.

If you prefer, you may paste the raw player analysis, planner draft, and auditor report (natural language). I will extract the items listed above and ask any clarifying questions only if something is ambiguous or missing.

Would you like to paste the three documents now, or fill the structured template?

NATURAL-PLAN sas_plan_5
------------------------------
Below is a clear, step-by-step, human-readable trace of the provided PDDL plan. Each step lists the action name, the time transition (current-time before -> after), the concrete object parameters, the required preconditions at that time, the effects (which atomic facts are added and which are removed), and a short resulting-state note. Each action advances time by one discrete succ step (duration = 1).

Initial relevant facts (from the problem init, time = t0)
- current-time: t0
- next: (object_0 object_6), (object_3 object_5), (object_4 object_6), (object_7 object_6), (object_8 object_6)
- hand: object_7, object_8
- cats: object_0
- texture: object_5, object_6
- spring: object_5, object_6
- stupendous: object_1, object_2
- collect: (object_5 object_1), (object_6 object_2)
- sneeze: object_3, object_4
- (No vase relations initially)

Step 1
- Action: sip t0 -> t1  | sip t0 t1 object_7 object_0 object_6
- Duration: 1 succ step (t0 to t1)
- Parameters: o0=object_7, o1=object_0, o2=object_6
- Preconditions required at t0:
  - current-time t0
  - succ t0 t1
  - hand object_7
  - cats object_0
  - texture object_6
  - next object_7 object_6
  - next object_0 object_6
  (All satisfied by the initial state.)
- Effects (applied at t1):
  - Add: vase object_7 object_0
  - Remove: next object_7 object_6
  - Advance current-time: remove current-time t0, add current-time t1
- Resulting relevant facts after step 1 (time = t1):
  - next: (object_0 object_6), (object_3 object_5), (object_4 object_6), (object_8 object_6)  [object_7->object_6 removed]
  - vase: (object_7 object_0)

Step 2
- Action: sip t1 -> t2  | sip t1 t2 object_8 object_0 object_6
- Duration: 1 succ step (t1 to t2)
- Parameters: o0=object_8, o1=object_0, o2=object_6
- Preconditions required at t1:
  - current-time t1
  - succ t1 t2
  - hand object_8
  - cats object_0
  - texture object_6
  - next object_8 object_6
  - next object_0 object_6
  (All satisfied after step 1.)
- Effects (applied at t2):
  - Add: vase object_8 object_0
  - Remove: next object_8 object_6
  - Advance current-time: remove current-time t1, add current-time t2
- Resulting relevant facts after step 2 (time = t2):
  - next: (object_0 object_6), (object_3 object_5), (object_4 object_6)  [object_8->object_6 removed]
  - vase: (object_7 object_0), (object_8 object_0)

Step 3
- Action: memory t2 -> t3  | memory t2 t3 object_0 object_6 object_5
- Duration: 1 succ step (t2 to t3)
- Parameters: o0=object_0, o1=object_6, o2=object_5
- Preconditions required at t2:
  - current-time t2
  - succ t2 t3
  - cats object_0
  - spring object_6
  - spring object_5
  - next object_0 object_6
  (All satisfied: next object_0 object_6 remained from init; spring and cats were in init.)
- Effects (applied at t3):
  - Add: next object_0 object_5
  - Remove: next object_0 object_6
  - Advance current-time: remove current-time t2, add current-time t3
- Resulting relevant facts after step 3 (time = t3):
  - next: (object_0 object_5), (object_3 object_5), (object_4 object_6)
  - vase: (object_7 object_0), (object_8 object_0)

Step 4
- Action: paltry t3 -> t4  | paltry t3 t4 object_7 object_0 object_5
- Duration: 1 succ step (t3 to t4)
- Parameters: o0=object_7, o1=object_0, o2=object_5
- Preconditions required at t3:
  - current-time t3
  - succ t3 t4
  - hand object_7
  - cats object_0
  - texture object_5
  - vase object_7 object_0
  - next object_0 object_5
  (All satisfied: vase created in Step 1, next object_0 object_5 created in Step 3.)
- Effects (applied at t4):
  - Remove: vase object_7 object_0
  - Add: next object_7 object_5
  - Advance current-time: remove current-time t3, add current-time t4
- Resulting relevant facts after step 4 (time = t4):
  - next: (object_0 object_5), (object_3 object_5), (object_4 object_6), (object_7 object_5)
  - vase: (object_8 object_0)  [object_7-object_0 vase removed]

Step 5
- Action: paltry t4 -> t5  | paltry t4 t5 object_8 object_0 object_5
- Duration: 1 succ step (t4 to t5)
- Parameters: o0=object_8, o1=object_0, o2=object_5
- Preconditions required at t4:
  - current-time t4
  - succ t4 t5
  - hand object_8
  - cats object_0
  - texture object_5
  - vase object_8 object_0
  - next object_0 object_5
  (All satisfied: vase object_8 object_0 from Step 2, next object_0 object_5 still present.)
- Effects (applied at t5):
  - Remove: vase object_8 object_0
  - Add: next object_8 object_5
  - Advance current-time: remove current-time t4, add current-time t5
- Resulting relevant facts after step 5 (time = t5):
  - next: (object_0 object_5), (object_3 object_5), (object_4 object_6), (object_7 object_5), (object_8 object_5)
  - vase: (none remaining)

Goal check (after step 5, time = t5)
- Goal required: next object_7 object_5 AND next object_8 object_5
- Achieved: next object_7 object_5 (added in Step 4) and next object_8 object_5 (added in Step 5).
- Plan success: both goal atoms are present at t5.

Notes
- Every step exactly follows the supplied plan actions and order; no actions were added or removed.
- Each action advances the discrete current-time by one succ step (t0→t1→t2→t3→t4→t5).
- The only vase relations created were intermediate bookkeeping that paltry later consumed; final state has no vase facts and the two required next relations are produced.

NATURAL-PLAN sas_plan_1
------------------------------
Plan (step-by-step, matching the given plan exactly). Each action is 1 time unit long. Timestamps show start time; effects take place immediately at the end of the action.

t = 0 (duration 1)
Action: memory object_1 object_6 object_7
- Preconditions checked before executing:
  - cats(object_1)
  - spring(object_6)
  - spring(object_7)
  - next(object_1, object_6)
- Effects (applied at t = 1):
  - add: next(object_1, object_7)
  - delete: next(object_1, object_6)

t = 1 (duration 1)
Action: sip object_9 object_1 object_7
- Preconditions checked before executing:
  - hand(object_9)
  - cats(object_1)
  - texture(object_7)
  - next(object_9, object_7)
  - next(object_1, object_7)  (this was created by the previous action)
- Effects (applied at t = 2):
  - add: vase(object_9, object_1)
  - delete: next(object_9, object_7)

t = 2 (duration 1)
Action: memory object_1 object_7 object_6
- Preconditions checked before executing:
  - cats(object_1)
  - spring(object_7)
  - spring(object_6)
  - next(object_1, object_7)  (exists because of the first memory action)
- Effects (applied at t = 3):
  - add: next(object_1, object_6)
  - delete: next(object_1, object_7)

t = 3 (duration 1)
Action: paltry object_9 object_1 object_6
- Preconditions checked before executing:
  - hand(object_9)
  - cats(object_1)
  - texture(object_6)
  - vase(object_9, object_1)    (created by sip at t=2)
  - next(object_1, object_6)    (restored by memory at t=3)
- Effects (applied at t = 4):
  - add: next(object_9, object_6)
  - delete: vase(object_9, object_1)

Final state check (after t = 4)
- Goal predicates:
  - next(object_8, object_7) — still true (it was true initially and never deleted).
  - next(object_9, object_6) — added by paltry at t = 4.
- Both goal conditions are satisfied.

Total plan cost: 4 actions (unit cost per action).

I am playing with a set of objects. Here are the actions I can do

Paltry object_0 object_1 object_2.
Sip object_0 object_1 object_2.
Clip object_0 object_1 object_2.
Wretched object_0 object_1 object_2 object_3.
Memory object_0 object_1 object_2.
Tightfisted object_0 object_1 object_2.

I have the following restrictions on my actions:
To perform paltry action, the following facts need to be true: hand object_0, cats object_1, texture object_2, vase object_0 object_1, and next object_1 object_2
Once paltry is performed the following facts will be true: next object_0 object_2
Once paltry is performed the following facts will be false: vase object_0 object_1
To perform sip action, the following facts need to be true: hand object_0, cats object_1, texture object_2, next object_0 object_2, and next object_1 object_2
Once sip is performed the following facts will be true: vase object_0 object_1
Once sip is performed the following facts will be false: next object_0 object_2
To perform clip action, the following facts need to be true: hand object_0, sneeze object_1, texture object_2, next object_1 object_2, and next object_0 object_2
Once clip is performed the following facts will be true: vase object_0 object_1
Once clip is performed the following facts will be false: next object_0 object_2
To perform wretched action, the following facts need to be true: sneeze object_0, texture object_1, texture object_2, stupendous object_3, next object_0 object_1, collect object_1 object_3, and collect object_2 object_3
Once wretched is performed the following facts will be true: next object_0 object_2

NATURAL-PLAN sas_plan_2
------------------------------
Plan (unit time per action; timestamps in seconds)

Initial relevant facts (from the problem)
- (hand object_9)
- (sneeze object_4)
- (texture object_7)
- (texture object_8)
- (next object_4 object_7)
- (next object_9 object_7)
- (collect object_7 object_2)
- (collect object_8 object_2)
- (stupendous object_2)

Step 1 — t = 0.0 → 1.0
Action: clip object_9 object_4 object_7
- Preconditions required (checked at t=0.0):
  - (hand object_9) — true
  - (sneeze object_4) — true
  - (texture object_7) — true
  - (next object_4 object_7) — true
  - (next object_9 object_7) — true
- Effects applied at t=1.0:
  - Add: (vase object_9 object_4)
  - Delete: (next object_9 object_7)
- State change summary: object_9 forms a vase relation with object_4; object_9 is no longer immediately successor of object_7.

Step 2 — t = 1.0 → 2.0
Action: wretched object_4 object_7 object_8 object_2
- Preconditions required (checked at t=1.0):
  - (sneeze object_4) — true
  - (texture object_7) — true
  - (texture object_8) — true
  - (stupendous object_2) — true
  - (next object_4 object_7) — true (still true after Step 1)
  - (collect object_7 object_2) — true
  - (collect object_8 object_2) — true
- Effects applied at t=2.0:
  - Add: (next object_4 object_8)
  - Delete: (next object_4 object_7)
- State change summary: object_4's successor is advanced from object_7 to object_8.

Step 3 — t = 2.0 → 3.0
Action: tightfisted object_9 object_4 object_8
- Preconditions required (checked at t=2.0):
  - (hand object_9) — true
  - (sneeze object_4) — true
  - (texture object_8) — true
  - (next object_4 object_8) — true (created in Step 2)
  - (vase object_9 object_4) — true (created in Step 1)
- Effects applied at t=3.0:
  - Add: (next object_9 object_8)
  - Delete: (vase object_9 object_4)
- State change summary: object_9 becomes the immediate successor of object_8 (goal achieved); the vase relation between object_9 and object_4 is removed.

Goal check (after t = 3.0)
- Goal predicate (next object_9 object_8) is true. Goal achieved.
Total plan cost (unit cost per action): 3.

PROBLEM
------------------------------
I am playing with a set of objects. Here are the actions I can do

Paltry object_0 object_1 object_2.
Sip object_0 object_1 object_2.
Clip object_0 object_1 object_2.
Wretched object_0 object_1 object_2 object_3.
Memory object_0 object_1 object_2.
Tightfisted object_0 object_1 object_2.

NATURAL-PLAN sas_plan_5
------------------------------
Summary: the following 7-step execution follows the provided plan exactly (each step takes 1 time unit). I report the action name, the concrete parameter bindings, the stage/time, the main preconditions that must hold, and the primary effects (what is added and what is deleted). After step 7 the goal (next object_9 object_7) is achieved.

Step 1 — time t=0..1
Action: wretched(object_3, object_5, object_6, object_1)  [stage: stage_0 -> stage_1]
Main preconditions checked:
- (sneeze object_3)
- (texture object_5)
- (texture object_6)
- (stupendous object_1)
- (next object_3 object_5)
- (collect object_5 object_1)
- (collect object_6 object_1)
- current-stage = stage_0 (succ stage_0 stage_1)
Effects:
- Added: (next object_3 object_6)
- Deleted: (next object_3 object_5)
- Stage advanced: current-stage becomes stage_1

Step 2 — time t=1..2
Action: clip(object_9, object_3, object_6)  [stage: stage_1 -> stage_2]
Main preconditions checked:
- (hand object_9)
- (sneeze object_3)
- (texture object_6)
- (next object_3 object_6)  (created in Step 1)
- (next object_9 object_6)  (initially present)
- current-stage = stage_1 (succ stage_1 stage_2)
Effects:
- Added: (vase object_9 object_3)
- Deleted: (next object_9 object_6)
- Stage advanced: current-stage becomes stage_2

Step 3 — time t=2..3
Action: wretched(object_3, object_6, object_5, object_1)  [stage: stage_2 -> stage_3]
Main preconditions checked:
- (sneeze object_3)
- (texture object_6)
- (texture object_5)
- (stupendous object_1)
- (next object_3 object_6)  (present from Step 1, not yet deleted by Step 2’s effects on that pair)
- (collect object_6 object_1)
- (collect object_5 object_1)
- current-stage = stage_2 (succ stage_2 stage_3)
Effects:
- Added: (next object_3 object_5)
- Deleted: (next object_3 object_6)
- Stage advanced: current-stage becomes stage_3

Step 4 — time t=3..4
Action: tightfisted(object_9, object_3, object_5)  [stage: stage_3 -> stage_4]
Main preconditions checked:
- (hand object_9)
- (sneeze object_3)
- (texture object_5)
- (next object_3 object_5)  (created in Step 3)
- (vase object_9 object_3)  (created in Step 2)
- current-stage = stage_3 (succ stage_3 stage_4)
Effects:
- Added: (next object_9 object_5)
- Deleted: (vase object_9 object_3)
- Stage advanced: current-stage becomes stage_4

Step 5 — time t=4..5
Action: sip(object_9, object_0, object_5)  [stage: stage_4 -> stage_5]
Main preconditions checked:
- (hand object_9)
- (cats object_0)
- (texture object_5)
- (next object_9 object_5)  (created in Step 4)
- (next object_0 object_5)  (initially present)
- current-stage = stage_4 (succ stage_4 stage_5)
Effects:
- Added: (vase object_9 object_0)
- Deleted: (next object_9 object_5)
- Stage advanced: current-stage becomes stage_5

Step 6 — time t=5..6
Action: memory(object_0, object_5, object_7)  [stage: stage_5 -> stage_6]
Main preconditions checked:
- (cats object_0)
- (spring object_5)
- (spring object_7)
- (next object_0 object_5)  (still present; not deleted before this step)
- current-stage = stage_5 (succ stage_5 stage_6)
Effects:
- Added: (next object_0 object_7)
- Deleted: (next object_0 object_5)
- Stage advanced: current-stage becomes stage_6

Step 7 — time t=6..7
Action: paltry(object_9, object_0, object_7)  [stage: stage_6 -> stage_7]
Main preconditions checked:
- (hand object_9)
- (cats object_0)
- (texture object_7)
- (vase object_9 object_0)  (created in Step 5)
- (next object_0 object_7)  (created in Step 6)
- current-stage = stage_6 (succ stage_6 stage_7)
Effects:
- Added: (next object_9 object_7)   ← Goal achieved
- Deleted: (vase object_9 object_0)
- Stage advanced: current-stage becomes stage_7

Outcome:
- At the end of Step 7 (time t=7) the goal fact (next object_9 object_7) holds, as required. Total plan cost = 7 (7 unit steps).

NATURAL-PLAN sas_plan_5
------------------------------
Initial time mapping: stage_0 = time 0, stage_1 = time 1, stage_2 = time 2, stage_3 = time 3, stage_4 = time 4, stage_5 = time 5, stage_6 = time 6.
Each action takes one time step (t -> t+1). The initial facts at time 0 are those given in the problem; stage-now = stage_0.

Plan (steps exactly as in the provided plan):

1) Time 0 → 1 — clip(object_10, object_5, object_9)
- Preconditions (checked at time 0): hand(object_10), sneeze(object_5), texture(object_9), next(object_5, object_9), next(object_10, object_9), stage-now = stage_0, succ(stage_0, stage_1).
- Effects applied at time 1:
  - Add: vase(object_10, object_5)
  - Delete: next(object_10, object_9)
  - Advance stage: stage-now becomes stage_1
- Notes: Valid because all preconditions were true in the initial state.

2) Time 1 → 2 — wretched(object_5, object_9, object_8, object_3)
- Preconditions (checked at time 1): sneeze(object_5), texture(object_9), texture(object_8), stupendous(object_3), next(object_5, object_9), collect(object_9, object_3), collect(object_8, object_3), stage-now = stage_1, succ(stage_1, stage_2).
- Effects applied at time 2:
  - Add: next(object_5, object_8)
  - Delete: next(object_5, object_9)
  - Advance stage: stage-now becomes stage_2

3) Time 2 → 3 — tightfisted(object_10, object_5, object_8)
- Preconditions (checked at time 2): hand(object_10), sneeze(object_5), texture(object_8), next(object_5, object_8), vase(object_10, object_5), stage-now = stage_2, succ(stage_2, stage_3).
- Effects applied at time 3:
  - Add: next(object_10, object_8)
  - Delete: vase(object_10, object_5)
  - Advance stage: stage-now becomes stage_3

4) Time 3 → 4 — sip(object_10, object_0, object_8)
- Preconditions (checked at time 3): hand(object_10), cats(object_0), texture(object_8), next(object_10, object_8), next(object_0, object_8), stage-now = stage_3, succ(stage_3, stage_4).
- Effects applied at time 4:
  - Add: vase(object_10, object_0)
  - Delete: next(object_10, object_8)
  - Advance stage: stage-now becomes stage_4

5) Time 4 → 5 — memory(object_0, object_8, object_6)
- Preconditions (checked at time 4): cats(object_0), spring(object_8), spring(object_6), next(object_0, object_8), stage-now = stage_4, succ(stage_4, stage_5).
- Effects applied at time 5:
  - Add: next(object_0, object_6)
  - Delete: next(object_0, object_8)
  - Advance stage: stage-now becomes stage_5

6) Time 5 → 6 — paltry(object_10, object_0, object_6)
- Preconditions (checked at time 5): hand(object_10), cats(object_0), texture(object_6), vase(object_10, object_0), next(object_0, object_6), stage-now = stage_5, succ(stage_5, stage_6).
- Effects applied at time 6:
  - Add: next(object_10, object_6)  ← goal achieved
  - Delete: vase(object_10, object_0)
  - Advance stage: stage-now becomes stage_6

Final state (time 6): next(object_10, object_6) is true — the specified goal is satisfied. Total cost (steps) = 6.
