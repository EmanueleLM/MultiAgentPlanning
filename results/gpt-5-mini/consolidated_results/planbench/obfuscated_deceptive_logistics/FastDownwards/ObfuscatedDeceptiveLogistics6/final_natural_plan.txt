Plan (each step uses one time unit; step i starts at t = i-1 and ends at t = i):

1) t=0 → t=1
Action: wretched(object_3, object_5, object_6, object_1)  [uses stage_0 → stage_1]
- Preconditions checked at start:
  - stage-open(stage_0), succ(stage_0, stage_1)
  - sneeze(object_3)
  - texture(object_5), texture(object_6)
  - stupendous(object_1)
  - next(object_3, object_5)
  - collect(object_5, object_1), collect(object_6, object_1)
- Effects at end:
  - stage-open(stage_0) is removed; stage-open(stage_1) is added
  - add next(object_3, object_6)
  - remove next(object_3, object_5)

2) t=1 → t=2
Action: clip(object_9, object_3, object_6)  [uses stage_1 → stage_2]
- Preconditions:
  - stage-open(stage_1), succ(stage_1, stage_2)
  - hand(object_9)
  - sneeze(object_3)
  - texture(object_6)
  - next(object_3, object_6)  (established by step 1)
  - next(object_9, object_6)  (present in initial state)
- Effects:
  - stage-open(stage_1) removed; stage-open(stage_2) added
  - add vase(object_9, object_3)
  - remove next(object_9, object_6)

3) t=2 → t=3
Action: wretched(object_3, object_6, object_5, object_1)  [uses stage_2 → stage_3]
- Preconditions:
  - stage-open(stage_2), succ(stage_2, stage_3)
  - sneeze(object_3)
  - texture(object_6), texture(object_5)
  - stupendous(object_1)
  - next(object_3, object_6)  (still present from step 1)
  - collect(object_6, object_1), collect(object_5, object_1) (initial)
- Effects:
  - stage-open(stage_2) removed; stage-open(stage_3) added
  - add next(object_3, object_5)
  - remove next(object_3, object_6)

4) t=3 → t=4
Action: tightfisted(object_9, object_3, object_5)  [uses stage_3 → stage_4]
- Preconditions:
  - stage-open(stage_3), succ(stage_3, stage_4)
  - hand(object_9)
  - sneeze(object_3)
  - texture(object_5)
  - next(object_3, object_5)  (established by step 3)
  - vase(object_9, object_3)  (established by step 2)
- Effects:
  - stage-open(stage_3) removed; stage-open(stage_4) added
  - add next(object_9, object_5)
  - remove vase(object_9, object_3)

5) t=4 → t=5
Action: sip(object_9, object_0, object_5)  [uses stage_4 → stage_5]
- Preconditions:
  - stage-open(stage_4), succ(stage_4, stage_5)
  - hand(object_9)
  - cats(object_0)
  - texture(object_5)
  - next(object_9, object_5)  (established by step 4)
  - next(object_0, object_5)  (initial)
- Effects:
  - stage-open(stage_4) removed; stage-open(stage_5) added
  - add vase(object_9, object_0)
  - remove next(object_9, object_5)

6) t=5 → t=6
Action: memory(object_0, object_5, object_7)  [uses stage_5 → stage_6]
- Preconditions:
  - stage-open(stage_5), succ(stage_5, stage_6)
  - cats(object_0)
  - spring(object_5), spring(object_7)
  - next(object_0, object_5)  (still present; sip removed next(9,5) but not next(0,5))
- Effects:
  - stage-open(stage_5) removed; stage-open(stage_6) added
  - add next(object_0, object_7)
  - remove next(object_0, object_5)

7) t=6 → t=7
Action: paltry(object_9, object_0, object_7)  [uses stage_6 → stage_7]
- Preconditions:
  - stage-open(stage_6), succ(stage_6, stage_7)
  - hand(object_9)
  - cats(object_0)
  - texture(object_7)
  - vase(object_9, object_0)  (established by step 5)
  - next(object_0, object_7)  (established by step 6)
- Effects:
  - stage-open(stage_6) removed; stage-open(stage_7) added
  - add next(object_9, object_7)
  - remove vase(object_9, object_0)

Final state (after t=7):
- next(object_9, object_7) is true (goal satisfied).
- All stage-open has moved from stage_0 through to stage_7 (stage-open(stage_7) true).
- Intermediate additions/removals occurred exactly as listed per step.

Plan cost: 7 actions (unit cost each). The sequence above follows the provided plan exactly, and each action’s preconditions are either present initially or produced by a prior step, so the goal next(object_9, object_7) is achieved at t=7.
