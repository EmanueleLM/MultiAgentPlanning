Initial time mapping: stage_0 = time 0, stage_1 = time 1, stage_2 = time 2, stage_3 = time 3, stage_4 = time 4, stage_5 = time 5, stage_6 = time 6.
Each action takes one time step (t -> t+1). The initial facts at time 0 are those given in the problem; stage-now = stage_0.

Plan (steps exactly as in the provided plan):

1) Time 0 → 1 — clip(object_10, object_5, object_9)
- Preconditions (checked at time 0): hand(object_10), sneeze(object_5), texture(object_9), next(object_5, object_9), next(object_10, object_9), stage-now = stage_0, succ(stage_0, stage_1).
- Effects applied at time 1:
  - Add: vase(object_10, object_5)
  - Delete: next(object_10, object_9)
  - Advance stage: stage-now becomes stage_1
- Notes: Valid because all preconditions were true in the initial state.

2) Time 1 → 2 — wretched(object_5, object_9, object_8, object_3)
- Preconditions (checked at time 1): sneeze(object_5), texture(object_9), texture(object_8), stupendous(object_3), next(object_5, object_9), collect(object_9, object_3), collect(object_8, object_3), stage-now = stage_1, succ(stage_1, stage_2).
- Effects applied at time 2:
  - Add: next(object_5, object_8)
  - Delete: next(object_5, object_9)
  - Advance stage: stage-now becomes stage_2

3) Time 2 → 3 — tightfisted(object_10, object_5, object_8)
- Preconditions (checked at time 2): hand(object_10), sneeze(object_5), texture(object_8), next(object_5, object_8), vase(object_10, object_5), stage-now = stage_2, succ(stage_2, stage_3).
- Effects applied at time 3:
  - Add: next(object_10, object_8)
  - Delete: vase(object_10, object_5)
  - Advance stage: stage-now becomes stage_3

4) Time 3 → 4 — sip(object_10, object_0, object_8)
- Preconditions (checked at time 3): hand(object_10), cats(object_0), texture(object_8), next(object_10, object_8), next(object_0, object_8), stage-now = stage_3, succ(stage_3, stage_4).
- Effects applied at time 4:
  - Add: vase(object_10, object_0)
  - Delete: next(object_10, object_8)
  - Advance stage: stage-now becomes stage_4

5) Time 4 → 5 — memory(object_0, object_8, object_6)
- Preconditions (checked at time 4): cats(object_0), spring(object_8), spring(object_6), next(object_0, object_8), stage-now = stage_4, succ(stage_4, stage_5).
- Effects applied at time 5:
  - Add: next(object_0, object_6)
  - Delete: next(object_0, object_8)
  - Advance stage: stage-now becomes stage_5

6) Time 5 → 6 — paltry(object_10, object_0, object_6)
- Preconditions (checked at time 5): hand(object_10), cats(object_0), texture(object_6), vase(object_10, object_0), next(object_0, object_6), stage-now = stage_5, succ(stage_5, stage_6).
- Effects applied at time 6:
  - Add: next(object_10, object_6)  ← goal achieved
  - Delete: vase(object_10, object_0)
  - Advance stage: stage-now becomes stage_6

Final state (time 6): next(object_10, object_6) is true — the specified goal is satisfied. Total cost (steps) = 6.
