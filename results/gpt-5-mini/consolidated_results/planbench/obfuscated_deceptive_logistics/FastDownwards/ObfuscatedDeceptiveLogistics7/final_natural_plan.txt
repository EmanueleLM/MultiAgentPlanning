Plan execution summary (stages enforce one action per discrete timestep; initial current-stage = s0). Total cost = 3 (three actions, 1 time unit each).

Schedule:
- t = 0..1: stage s0 → s1
- t = 1..2: stage s1 → s2
- t = 2..3: stage s2 → s3

Step 1 — (t = 0 → 1) Action: clip object_9 object_4 object_8 (consumes stage s0, advances to s1)
- Preconditions checked at t=0:
  - hand object_9 (true in init)
  - sneeze object_4 (true in init)
  - texture object_8 (true in init)
  - next object_4 object_8 (true in init)
  - next object_9 object_8 (true in init)
  - current-stage s0 and succ(s0, s1) (true)
- Effects applied at t=1:
  - Add: vase object_9 object_4
  - Delete: next object_9 object_8
  - Advance stage: current-stage becomes s1

Step 2 — (t = 1 → 2) Action: wretched object_4 object_8 object_7 object_2 (consumes stage s1, advances to s2)
- Preconditions checked at t=1:
  - sneeze object_4 (true in init)
  - texture object_8 (true in init)
  - texture object_7 (true in init)
  - stupendous object_2 (true in init)
  - next object_4 object_8 (was true in init and not deleted by Step 1)
  - collect object_8 object_2 (true in init)
  - collect object_7 object_2 (true in init)
  - current-stage s1 and succ(s1, s2) (true)
- Effects applied at t=2:
  - Add: next object_4 object_7
  - Delete: next object_4 object_8
  - Advance stage: current-stage becomes s2

Step 3 — (t = 2 → 3) Action: tightfisted object_9 object_4 object_7 (consumes stage s2, advances to s3)
- Preconditions checked at t=2:
  - hand object_9 (true in init)
  - sneeze object_4 (true in init)
  - texture object_7 (true in init)
  - next object_4 object_7 (added by Step 2)
  - vase object_9 object_4 (added by Step 1 and not yet deleted)
  - current-stage s2 and succ(s2, s3) (true)
- Effects applied at t=3:
  - Add: next object_9 object_7
  - Delete: vase object_9 object_4
  - Advance stage: current-stage becomes s3

Final state (after t=3)
- Goal predicates:
  - next object_10 object_5 — was true in the initial state and remained true throughout.
  - next object_9 object_7 — established by Step 3.
- Both goal predicates satisfied. Total plan cost: 3 (three discrete-stage actions).
