Summary: Execute the three planned actions in order. Each step lists the action, the grounded parameters, a brief timestamp/duration, the key preconditions used (from the initial state or earlier effects), and the effects produced. This sequence exactly follows the given plan and achieves the scenario_1 goals (next object_10 object_5) and (next object_9 object_7).

1) Time 00:00 → 00:01 — Action: clip(object_9, object_4, object_8) [stage_1 → stage_2]
   - Preconditions used:
     - available(stage_1) and succ(stage_1, stage_2) (stage token for step 1)
     - hand(object_9) (initial fact)
     - sneeze(object_4) (initial fact)
     - texture(object_8) (initial fact)
     - next(object_4, object_8) (initial fact)
     - next(object_9, object_8) (initial fact)
   - Effects:
     - consumes available(stage_1) and makes available(stage_2)
     - adds vase(object_9, object_4)
     - deletes next(object_9, object_8)
   - Notes: This establishes the vase between object_9 and object_4 needed later, and removes the previous next relation from object_9 to object_8.

2) Time 00:01 → 00:02 — Action: wretched(object_4, object_8, object_7, object_2) [stage_2 → stage_3]
   - Preconditions used:
     - available(stage_2) and succ(stage_2, stage_3) (stage token for step 2)
     - sneeze(object_4) (initial fact)
     - texture(object_8) and texture(object_7) (initial facts)
     - stupendous(object_2) (initial fact)
     - next(object_4, object_8) (initial fact still true at this point)
     - collect(object_8, object_2) and collect(object_7, object_2) (initial facts)
   - Effects:
     - consumes available(stage_2) and makes available(stage_3)
     - adds next(object_4, object_7)
     - deletes next(object_4, object_8)
   - Notes: This moves the "next" relation for object_4 from object_8 to object_7, producing the intermediate relation needed for the final step.

3) Time 00:02 → 00:03 — Action: tightfisted(object_9, object_4, object_7) [stage_3 → stage_4]
   - Preconditions used:
     - available(stage_3) and succ(stage_3, stage_4) (stage token for step 3)
     - hand(object_9) (initial fact)
     - sneeze(object_4) (initial fact)
     - texture(object_7) (initial fact)
     - next(object_4, object_7) (produced by step 2)
     - vase(object_9, object_4) (produced by step 1)
   - Effects:
     - consumes available(stage_3) and makes available(stage_4)
     - adds next(object_9, object_7)
     - deletes vase(object_9, object_4)
   - Notes: This produces the required goal relation next(object_9, object_7).

Final state with respect to goals:
- next(object_10, object_5) — was true in the initial state and remains true (goal satisfied).
- next(object_9, object_7) — produced by step 3 (goal satisfied).

Plan cost: 3 actions (unit cost per action).
