Summary: follow the provided plan exactly. Each step lists the action name, the objects bound to each parameter (with their intended roles), a timestamp and duration, the key preconditions that were true when the action executed, and the resulting add/delete effects on the state.

Initial relevant facts (from the problem) used below:
- texture: object_5, object_6, object_7, object_8
- next: object_0→object_5, object_10→object_5, object_3→object_5, object_4→object_8, object_9→object_5
- collect: object_5→object_1, object_6→object_1, object_7→object_2, object_8→object_2
- spring: object_5, object_7
(Other unary type roles: object_9,object_10 are hands; object_3,object_4 are sneezes; object_1,object_2 are stupendous.)

Plan (5 steps; cost = 5). Timestamps are illustrative (each step duration = 1.0s):

1) Time 0.0s (duration 1.0s) — Action: clip object_9 object_3 object_5
- Parameters / roles:
  - object_9 = hand
  - object_3 = sneeze
  - object_5 = obj (target texture)
- Preconditions checked (all true before execution):
  - texture(object_5)
  - next(object_3, object_5)
  - next(object_9, object_5)
- Effects (state changes):
  - Add: vase(object_9, object_3)
  - Delete: next(object_9, object_5)
- Notes: object_9 is no longer next to object_5 after this step; a vase relation between object_9 and object_3 is created.

2) Time 1.0s (duration 1.0s) — Action: clip object_10 object_3 object_5
- Parameters / roles:
  - object_10 = hand
  - object_3 = sneeze
  - object_5 = obj
- Preconditions (all true before execution):
  - texture(object_5)
  - next(object_3, object_5)
  - next(object_10, object_5)
- Effects:
  - Add: vase(object_10, object_3)
  - Delete: next(object_10, object_5)
- Notes: object_10 is no longer next to object_5 after this step; a vase relation between object_10 and object_3 is created.

3) Time 2.0s (duration 1.0s) — Action: wretched object_3 object_5 object_6 object_1
- Parameters / roles:
  - object_3 = sneeze (the mover)
  - object_5 = obj (source object)
  - object_6 = obj (destination object)
  - object_1 = stupendous (collector index)
- Preconditions (all true before execution):
  - texture(object_5)
  - texture(object_6)
  - collect(object_5, object_1)
  - collect(object_6, object_1)
  - next(object_3, object_5)  (object_3 was still next to object_5)
- Effects:
  - Add: next(object_3, object_6)
  - Delete: next(object_3, object_5)
- Notes: object_3 moves its "next" relation from object_5 to object_6.

4) Time 3.0s (duration 1.0s) — Action: tightfisted object_9 object_3 object_6
- Parameters / roles:
  - object_9 = hand
  - object_3 = sneeze
  - object_6 = obj (target)
- Preconditions (all true before execution):
  - texture(object_6)
  - next(object_3, object_6)   (established in step 3)
  - vase(object_9, object_3)   (established in step 1)
- Effects:
  - Add: next(object_9, object_6)
  - Delete: vase(object_9, object_3)
- Notes: object_9 becomes next to object_6; its vase relation with object_3 is removed.

5) Time 4.0s (duration 1.0s) — Action: tightfisted object_10 object_3 object_6
- Parameters / roles:
  - object_10 = hand
  - object_3 = sneeze
  - object_6 = obj
- Preconditions (all true before execution):
  - texture(object_6)
  - next(object_3, object_6)   (still true from step 3)
  - vase(object_10, object_3)  (established in step 2)
- Effects:
  - Add: next(object_10, object_6)
  - Delete: vase(object_10, object_3)
- Notes: object_10 becomes next to object_6; its vase relation with object_3 is removed.

Final state (relevant facts) after step 5:
- next(object_10, object_6) — achieved
- next(object_9, object_6)  — achieved
- The goal (next object_10 object_6 and next object_9 object_6) is satisfied.
- Some intermediate facts removed as documented (vase and old next relations).

Plan cost: 5 (5 actions).
