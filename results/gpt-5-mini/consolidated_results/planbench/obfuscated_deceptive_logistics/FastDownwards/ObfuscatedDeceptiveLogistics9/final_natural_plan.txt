Plan (5 actions, each 1 time unit; total cost = 5). Each step lists the action, its exact arguments (including stage transition), the assumed preconditions that allow it to fire, and the explicit effects produced.

Step 1 — time 0.0 → 1.0
Action: clip object_10 object_3 object_5 (stage s0 → s1)
- Preconditions (satisfied at start):
  - current s0, succ s0 s1
  - hand object_10
  - sneeze object_3
  - texture object_5
  - next object_3 object_5
  - next object_10 object_5
- Effects (applied at time 1.0):
  - add: vase object_10 object_3
  - delete: next object_10 object_5
  - advance stage: unset current s0, set current s1

Step 2 — time 1.0 → 2.0
Action: clip object_9 object_3 object_5 (stage s1 → s2)
- Preconditions:
  - current s1, succ s1 s2
  - hand object_9
  - sneeze object_3
  - texture object_5
  - next object_3 object_5
  - next object_9 object_5
- Effects (applied at time 2.0):
  - add: vase object_9 object_3
  - delete: next object_9 object_5
  - advance stage: unset current s1, set current s2

Step 3 — time 2.0 → 3.0
Action: wretched object_3 object_5 object_6 object_1 (stage s2 → s3)
- Preconditions:
  - current s2, succ s2 s3
  - sneeze object_3
  - texture object_5
  - texture object_6
  - stupendous object_1
  - next object_3 object_5
  - collect object_5 object_1
  - collect object_6 object_1
- Effects (applied at time 3.0):
  - add: next object_3 object_6
  - delete: next object_3 object_5
  - advance stage: unset current s2, set current s3

Step 4 — time 3.0 → 4.0
Action: tightfisted object_10 object_3 object_6 (stage s3 → s4)
- Preconditions:
  - current s3, succ s3 s4
  - hand object_10
  - sneeze object_3
  - texture object_6
  - next object_3 object_6
  - vase object_10 object_3
- Effects (applied at time 4.0):
  - add: next object_10 object_6
  - delete: vase object_10 object_3
  - advance stage: unset current s3, set current s4

Step 5 — time 4.0 → 5.0
Action: tightfisted object_9 object_3 object_6 (stage s4 → s5)
- Preconditions:
  - current s4, succ s4 s5
  - hand object_9
  - sneeze object_3
  - texture object_6
  - next object_3 object_6
  - vase object_9 object_3
- Effects (applied at time 5.0):
  - add: next object_9 object_6
  - delete: vase object_9 object_3
  - advance stage: unset current s4, set current s5

Result after Step 5 (time = 5.0)
- Goals achieved:
  - next object_10 object_6 (established at Step 4)
  - next object_9 object_6 (established at Step 5)

Notes:
- Each action corresponds exactly to one plan step and advances the discrete stage by one (s0→s1→s2→s3→s4→s5).
- Each action was treated as taking 1.0 time unit (consistent with total cost = 5).
