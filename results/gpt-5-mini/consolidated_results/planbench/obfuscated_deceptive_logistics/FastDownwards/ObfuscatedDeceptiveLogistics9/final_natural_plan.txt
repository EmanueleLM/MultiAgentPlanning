Below is a step-by-step, human-readable rendering of the given plan. Each step lists the action (with its object arguments), the time interval (unit duration per stage transition), the key preconditions that must hold at the start of the step, and the main effects produced at the end of the step. The sequence is identical to the provided plan (7 actions, cost = 7).

Step 1 — t = 0 → 1
- Action: clip(object_10, object_4, object_6)
- Preconditions at t=0: hand(object_10), sneeze(object_4), texture(object_6), next(object_4, object_6), next(object_10, object_6), current(stage_0)
- Effects at t=1: make vase(object_10, object_4) true; delete next(object_10, object_6); advance current to stage_1
- Notes: This binds object_10 to object_4 as a vase pair and removes object_10→object_6.

Step 2 — t = 1 → 2
- Action: wretched(object_4, object_6, object_7, object_2)
- Preconditions at t=1: sneeze(object_4), texture(object_6), texture(object_7), stupendous(object_2), next(object_4, object_6), collect(object_6, object_2), collect(object_7, object_2), current(stage_1)
- Effects at t=2: make next(object_4, object_7) true; delete next(object_4, object_6); advance current to stage_2
- Notes: Moves object_4’s "next" link from object_6 to object_7.

Step 3 — t = 2 → 3
- Action: tightfisted(object_10, object_4, object_7)
- Preconditions at t=2: hand(object_10), sneeze(object_4), texture(object_7), next(object_4, object_7), vase(object_10, object_4), current(stage_2)
- Effects at t=3: make next(object_10, object_7) true; delete vase(object_10, object_4); advance current to stage_3
- Notes: This establishes next(object_10, object_7) — satisfying the first goal atom.

Step 4 — t = 3 → 4
- Action: wretched(object_5, object_8, object_9, object_3)
- Preconditions at t=3: sneeze(object_5), texture(object_8), texture(object_9), stupendous(object_3), next(object_5, object_8), collect(object_8, object_3), collect(object_9, object_3), current(stage_3)
- Effects at t=4: make next(object_5, object_9) true; delete next(object_5, object_8); advance current to stage_4
- Notes: Repositions object_5’s "next" link from object_8 to object_9 in preparation for the object_11 chain.

Step 5 — t = 4 → 5
- Action: clip(object_11, object_5, object_9)
- Preconditions at t=4: hand(object_11), sneeze(object_5), texture(object_9), next(object_5, object_9), next(object_11, object_9), current(stage_4)
- Effects at t=5: make vase(object_11, object_5) true; delete next(object_11, object_9); advance current to stage_5
- Notes: Creates vase(object_11, object_5) and removes object_11→object_9.

Step 6 — t = 5 → 6
- Action: wretched(object_5, object_9, object_8, object_3)
- Preconditions at t=5: sneeze(object_5), texture(object_9), texture(object_8), stupendous(object_3), next(object_5, object_9), collect(object_9, object_3), collect(object_8, object_3), current(stage_5)
- Effects at t=6: make next(object_5, object_8) true; delete next(object_5, object_9); advance current to stage_6
- Notes: Restores object_5’s "next" link to object_8 (after having used object_5 to manipulate object_11’s link).

Step 7 — t = 6 → 7
- Action: tightfisted(object_11, object_5, object_8)
- Preconditions at t=6: hand(object_11), sneeze(object_5), texture(object_8), next(object_5, object_8), vase(object_11, object_5), current(stage_6)
- Effects at t=7: make next(object_11, object_8) true; delete vase(object_11, object_5); advance current to stage_7
- Notes: This establishes next(object_11, object_8) — satisfying the second goal atom.

Final state (after t = 7)
- Achieved goal atoms: next(object_10, object_7) and next(object_11, object_8) are both true.
- Total plan cost (unit per action): 7.

This sequence exactly matches the provided plan, with each step shown at unit time intervals [t, t+1], preconditions evaluated at the step start, and effects applied at the step end.
