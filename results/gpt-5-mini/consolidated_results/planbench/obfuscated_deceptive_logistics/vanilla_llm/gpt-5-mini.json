    "response": "No valid plan exists from the given initial state. Explanation:\n\n- The goal requires next(object_7,object_6) and next(object_8,object_6). next(object_7,object_6) is already true in the initial state; the only missing atom is next(object_8,object_6).\n\n- Only four actions can add a next(...) fact: paltry, wretched, memory, tightfisted. Consider each for producing next(8,6):\n\n  1. paltry(8, X, 6) requires:\n     - hand 8 (satisfied),\n     - cats X,\n     - texture 6 (satisfied),\n     - vase(8,X),\n     - next(X,6).\n     We can pick X = 0 because cats 0 and next(0,6) are present. That leaves vase(8,0) as the missing precondition. Vase facts can only be produced by sip or clip with first argument equal to 8; both sip and clip require next(8,6) as a precondition. So creating vase(8,0) would require next(8,6) already \u2014 circular dependency. Thus paltry cannot produce next(8,6).\n\n  2. tightfisted(8, X, 6) requires hand 8 (ok), sneeze X, texture 6, next(X,6), and vase(8,X). The only X with sneeze and next(X,6) initially is X = 4 (sneeze 4 and next 4 6 exist). Again vase(8,4) is required and can only be made by sip/clip(8, ...), which need next(8,6). So tightfisted also is blocked by the same circularity.\n\n  3. memory(8, A, 6) requires cats 8, spring A, spring 6, and next(8,A). While springs and an appropriate next(8,A) (next 8 5) exist, cats 8 does not and no action adds cats facts. So memory cannot be enabled.\n\n  4. wretched(8,1,6,3) would require sneeze 8 (not present) and additionally needs collect(1,3) and collect(6,3) for the same object_3. Initial collect facts are collect(5,1) and collect(6,2) \u2014 there is no common object_3 that makes both collect(5,X) and collect(6,X) true. Also no action changes collect or sneeze. So wretched cannot be used.\n\nBecause none of the actions that can create next(8,6) can be enabled from the initial facts (and no action can introduce the missing enabling facts), next(object_8,object_6) is unreachable. Therefore there is no valid plan under the current initial conditions.\n\nIf you want a concrete way to make the goal reachable, a minimal useful change is to add cats object_8 to the initial facts. Then memory(object_8,object_5,object_6) would be applicable (cats 8, spring 5, spring 6, next 8 5 all hold) and would produce next(8,6) in one step. With that single extra initial fact, the plan would be:\n\n- memory object_8 object_5 object_6\n\n(and next 7 6 is already true)."

Short proof sketch why it's unreachable:\n\n  - The only operators that can add a next(a,b) where a is a \"hand\" object (like object_9) are paltry and tightfisted.\n  - paltry(object_9, o1, b) requires next object_0 b (because paltry uses o1 = the cats object_0). next object_0 can only ever be 5 or 7 in this domain: initially next object_0 object_5, and the only operator that changes next object_0 is memory, which only swaps between spring-labeled objects present (here 5 and 7). So paltry can only ever produce next hand -> 5 or 7, never -> 6.\n  - tightfisted(object_9, s, b) requires (a) a sneeze node s (only object_3 or object_4) with next s b, and (b) a vase object_9 s. To get next object_9 object_6 via tightfisted we could use s = object_3 because next object_3 object_6 is present initially. But we then need vase object_9 object_3.\n  - A vase object_9 object_3 can only be produced by clip(object_9, object_3, x) for some x, and clip requires both next object_3 x and next object_9 x to hold. If x = object_6, that would require next object_9 object_6 already (circular). If x = object_5, that requires next object_9 object_5, which itself is not reachable by paltry (as argued) or tightfisted without already having vase/object relations that depend on next object_9 object_6. Thus there is a circular dependency preventing creation of vase object_9 object_3 unless next object_9 object_6 already holds.\n  - Therefore next object_9 object_6 cannot be derived from the initial facts with the available operators.\n\nConclusion:\n- The plan above achieves two of the three goals (next object_10 object_8 and next object_11 object_7).\n- The third goal (next object_9 object_6) is not reachable given the operators and initial state; no full plan exists that achieves all three goals simultaneously."

Tightfisted object_11 object_5 object_9.\n   - After these steps: next object_11 object_9 is achieved.\n\nResult:\n- Achieved: next object_11 object_9 and next object_12 object_8.\n- Not achievable: next object_10 object_7.\n\nWhy next object_10 object_7 is not achievable (brief justification):\n- To produce next object_10 object_7 you must use either Paltry or Tightfisted (these are the actions that set next for a hand object).\n  - Paltry(object_10, c, object_7) requires cats(c) and next(c, object_7). The only cats are object_0 and object_1, and neither can ever have next(..., object_7) because Memory only moves a cat's next between spring objects (object_6 and object_8) \u2014 object_7 is not a spring here. So Paltry cannot create next object_10 object_7.\n  - Tightfisted(object_10, s, object_7) requires vase(object_10, s) and next(s, object_7) where s is a sneeze object. The only sneeze with next(..., object_7) initially is object_4. So we would need to create vase(object_10, object_4).\n- Creating vase(object_10, object_4) can only be done by Clip (sets vase(h,s) but requires next(h,t) and next(s,t) for some t) or Sip (sets vase(h,c) only for cat c). Sip cannot produce a vase whose second argument is a sneeze (object_4). So only Clip could produce vase(object_10, object_4). Clip(object_10, object_4, t) would therefore require next(object_10, t) and next(object_4, t) for the same t.\n- Initially next(object_10, t) holds only for t = object_9. So t would have to be object_9. That requires next(object_4, object_9) to hold. But next(object_4, object_9) cannot be produced by Wretched on object_4 because Wretched can only change object_4's next to some object t2 when collect(t1, stup) and collect(t2, stup) share the same stup; object_4's current target is object_7 (collect object_7 object_2), while object_9 collects to a different stup (collect object_9 object_3). There is no way with the given collect/stupendous facts to make next(object_4, object_9).\n- Therefore vase(object_10, object_4) cannot be created, so Tightfisted cannot be used to set next object_10 object_7, and Paltry cannot be used either (cats cannot reach object_7). This makes next object_10 object_7 unreachable from the given initial state and actions.\n\nIf you want, I can:\n- produce the same plan in another notation, or\n- try a (possibly exhaustive) search to prove formally that next object_10 object_7 is unreachable, or\n- try relaxed alternative goals or modifications to objects/initial facts that would make next object_10 object_7 reachable."

Reasoning (short):\n\n1) Which actions can make a next fact of the form next X 7?\n- paltry(X, Y, 7) adds next X 7 but requires next Y 7 and cats Y (Y must be a cat).\n- tightfisted(X, Y, 7) adds next X 7 but requires next Y 7 and sneeze Y (Y must be a sneeze).\n- memory adds next for a cats-object P to some R, but R must be a spring (only object_6 or object_8 are springs here), so memory can never produce next P 7 because 7 is not a spring.\n- wretched adds next for a sneeze-object A to some C (C can be 7 if texture 7), but wretched requires an existing next A B (it moves next A B -> next A C). So wretched cannot bootstrap a next for a sneeze object unless that sneeze object already has a next fact.\n\n2) Inspect initial state:\n- Cats: object_0, object_1.\n- Sneeze: object_4, object_5.\n- Springs: object_6, object_8.\n- There are no initial next facts with target 7, and no initial next facts with subject in {object_4, object_5} (the sneeze objects).\n- The only existing next facts for the cat objects are next 0 8 and next 1 6. Memory can move those cat nexts only to other springs (6 or 8), never to 7.\n\n3) Conclusion about reaching next hand->7 (for hand = object_10,11,12):\n- To create next object_10 7 (or for 11,12) you must use either paltry or tightfisted (the only operators that add next hand->z). Both require next Y 7 for some Y (paltry: Y a cat; tightfisted: Y a sneeze).\n- There is no way to establish next Y 7 for a cat Y: memory only targets springs (6 or 8), so next cat->7 cannot be produced.\n- There is no way to establish next Y 7 for a sneeze Y: the only operator that can change next for a sneeze is wretched, but wretched requires an existing next for that sneeze (it cannot create the first next for a sneeze); there are initially no next facts for sneeze objects, so wretched cannot be bootstrapped.\n\nTherefore none of next object_10 object_7, next object_11 object_7, next object_12 object_7 can be achieved; the goal is unreachable with the given actions and initial state.\n\nIf you want, I can:\n- propose the minimal changes to the initial state that would make the goal reachable (e.g. give one sneeze object an initial next to object_6 so wretched can produce next->7, or make object_7 a spring so memory can produce next cat->7), or\n- search for a plan under a modified initial state you specify.

    "response": "Short answer: There is no valid plan from the given initial state that achieves your goal. Two of the required goal atoms (next object_11 object_7 and next object_12 object_7) are unreachable; hence the whole goal set is unreachable.\n\nWhy (concise proof):\n\n1) Which actions can add next object_11 ? (i.e. change next for object_11)\n   - Actions whose effect can add next object_11 X are paltry, wretched, memory, tightfisted (they have \"Once ... the following facts will be true: next object_0 object_2\").\n   - For using any of those with object_0 = object_11:\n     - memory requires cats object_11 \u2014 cats holds only for object_0 (object_0), so memory is inapplicable for object_11.\n     - wretched requires sneeze object_11 \u2014 initial sneeze facts are only for object_3 and object_4, so wretched is inapplicable for object_11.\n     - paltry requires vase object_11 object_1 and cats object_1. cats is true only for object_0, so paltry would require vase object_11 object_0 (i.e. vase 11 0).\n     - tightfisted requires vase object_11 object_1 where object_1 must be a sneeze object (3 or 4). So tightfisted would require vase 11 3 or vase 11 4.\n\n2) How can vase 11 X be produced?\n   - The only actions that can produce vase facts are sip and clip (both set vase object_0 object_1 true).\n   - sip producing vase 11 Y requires as preconditions next object_11 K (some K) and next object_Y K (and cats Y etc.). So sip requires next 11 K already true.\n   - clip producing vase 11 Y requires as preconditions next 11 K and next Y K (and sneeze Y etc.). So clip also requires next 11 K already true.\n\n3) Conclusion for object_11:\n   - Any action that would add the required vase(11, \u00b7) needs next(11, \u00b7) already true. That makes creating the needed vase for object_11 circular and impossible from the initial state. Therefore no action can produce the vase facts needed by paltry/tightfisted to change next for object_11. Hence next object_11 object_7 is unreachable.\n\n4) The same argument applies to object_12:\n   - memory/wretched inapplicable for object_12 (no cats 12, no sneeze 12).\n   - paltry/tightfisted require vase 12 \u00b7, and any action that would produce vase 12 \u00b7 (sip/clip) requires next 12 \u00b7 already true. So next 12 cannot be changed from its initial value next 12 6 to next 12 7.\n\nBecause two of the goal atoms are unreachable, the overall goal set is unreachable and there is no valid plan from the given initial state.\n\nIf you want a plan, possible remedies (pick one or more):\n- Add an initial vase fact such as vase object_11 object_0 or vase object_12 object_0 (so paltry can be used), or\n- Add sneeze object_11 or sneeze object_12 (so wretched/tightfisted/clip alternatives may become applicable), or\n- Allow cats to hold for additional objects (so memory/sip/paltry become applicable for them), or\n- Add an initial next object_11 K (i.e. bootstrap vase creation via sip/clip becomes possible).\n\nIf you want, tell me which allowed modification(s) you prefer and I will produce a concrete plan."

The overall goal (next 10 8, next 11 6, next 12 8, next 9 5) is not achievable \u2014 there is no valid plan that reaches all four goal facts. The obstruction is structural and unavoidable; I give the short proof below and then note which parts are reachable.\n\nWhy the full goal is impossible (short proof)\n- The only actions that can establish a next relation for a hand object_h are paltry(object_h, cats, t) and tightfisted(object_h, sneeze, t).\n  - paltry can only make next(object_h, t) with t equal to a value that cats (object_0) currently points to. In the domain cats is only object_0, and memory(object_0, ..) can only switch object_0 between spring objects 5 and 7 (because the only spring objects are 5 and 7). So paltry can only ever produce next(object_h, 5) or next(object_h, 7), never next(object_h, 6).\n  - tightfisted can produce next(object_h, t) only for t that some sneeze object currently points to; sneeze objects are object_3 and object_4 and each can only toggle within its \u201ccollect\u201d group:\n    - object_3 can only be in {5,6} (collect pairs connect 5\u21946 via stupendous object_1).\n    - object_4 can only be in {7,8} (collect pairs connect 7\u21948 via stupendous object_2).\n    So the only sneeze that can ever have t=6 is object_3.\n- To apply tightfisted(11, object_3, 6) (the only way to make next object_11 6) you also need vase object_11 object_3 to exist at that time.\n- The only action that can create a vase between a hand and a sneeze is clip(hand, sneeze, t), and clip can create vase(hand, sneeze) only when next(hand, t) and next(sneeze, t) already both hold. For vase object_11 object_3 to be created by clip, you therefore need next(object_11, 6) to already hold (because next(object_3, 6) is the t we would use). That is circular: clip requires next(object_11, 6) to create the vase needed to later enable tightfisted to create next(object_11, 6).\n- There is no other action that can create vase object_11 object_3 (sip creates vase with cats only, paltry/tightfisted delete vases rather than move them). Hence vase object_11 object_3 cannot be produced unless next(object_11, 6) already existed; therefore next(object_11, 6) cannot be established starting from the given initial state.\n\nBecause next object_11 6 is therefore unreachable, the full conjunction of four goal facts is unreachable. (If any single goal atom is unreachable then the overall goal is unreachable.)\n\nWhat is reachable\n- Some of the target next facts are reachable independently. For example next object_10 object_8 can be achieved by:\n  1) wretched(object_4, 8, 7, object_2) \u2014 toggle next(4) from 8\u21927\n  2) clip(object_10, object_4, 7) \u2014 creates vase(10,4), deletes next(10,7)\n  3) wretched(object_4, 7, 8, object_2) \u2014 toggle next(4) back 7\u21928\n  4) tightfisted(object_10, object_4, 8) \u2014 uses vase(10,4) and next(4,8) to add next(10,8)\n  (A similar pattern can produce next(12,8) using sip + memory + paltry to get next(12,7) and then the same clip/wretched/tightfisted maneuver.)\n- But even if you can realize three of the four desired next facts by suitable sequences, the fact next(11,6) is the blocking atom; because it is impossible the full goal conjunction cannot be achieved.\n\nIf you want, I can:\n- produce concrete action sequences that achieve each reachable target (e.g. explicit step lists for next 10 8 and next 12 8), or\n- search for a maximal subset of the goal that is jointly achievable and give a plan to reach that subset, or\n- revise the goal (for example replace next 11 6 with next 11 7 or 11 5) and attempt to synthesize a full plan for the revised goal set.\n\nWhich would you prefer?"

    "response": "Summary: Your full goal (next o10 o6, next o11 o9, next o12 o7, next o13 o9) is not reachable from the given initial state and actions. Reason: each hand\u2019s current texture (the \"next\" it already has) constrains which textures it can be moved to; actions only let a hand move within the two-texture pair controlled by a sneeze (o4 controls {6,7}, o5 controls {8,9}). That makes some target edges impossible:\n\nWhy infeasible\n- o10 starts with next o10 o9. Because the only sneeze that can be used to flip a 9 is o5 (which toggles 9<->8), o10 can only be changed to 8 or remain 9. It cannot ever reach 6. So next o10 o6 is impossible.\n- o12 starts with next o12 o9. Same reasoning as o10: it can only end up in {8,9}, so next o12 o7 is impossible.\n- o13 starts with next o13 o6. Sneeze o4 controls {6,7}, so o13 can only be {6,7}; it cannot reach 9. So next o13 o9 is impossible.\n\nThe only goal atom from your requested set that is individually reachable is next o11 o9 (o11 starts at 8 and can be flipped to 9 using sneeze o5). So the whole conjunction cannot be achieved.\n\nFeasible alternative\nA natural feasible variant is to move each hand into the texture that is reachable within its sneeze-group:\n- set next o10 o8 (9->8),\n- set next o11 o9 (8->9),\n- set next o12 o8 (9->8),\n- set next o13 o7 (6->7).\n\nBelow is a concrete, valid action sequence (order matters) that achieves that feasible alternative. I also note why each step is legal briefly.\n\nPlan (achieves next o10 o8, next o11 o9, next o12 o8, next o13 o7)\n\n1) wretched o5 9 8 o3\n   - preconditions: sneeze o5, next o5 o9, collect o9 o3, collect o8 o3, stupendous o3 \u2014 all true initially.\n   - effect: next o5 o8 (o5: 9 -> 8).\n\n2) clip o11 o5 8\n   - pre: hand o11, sneeze o5, texture o8, next o5 o8 (set by step 1), next o11 o8 (initial).\n   - effect: vase o11 o5, deletes next o11 o8.\n\n3) wretched o5 8 9 o3\n   - flips o5 back: next o5 o9.\n\n4) tightfisted o11 o5 9\n   - pre: hand o11, sneeze o5, texture o9, next o5 o9 (from step 3), vase o11 o5 (from step 2).\n   - effect: next o11 o9 (goal for o11 achieved), deletes vase o11 o5.\n\n5) clip o10 o5 9\n   - pre: hand o10, sneeze o5, texture o9, next o5 o9 (still true), next o10 o9 (initial).\n   - effect: vase o10 o5, deletes next o10 o9.\n\n6) clip o12 o5 9\n   - pre: hand o12, sneeze o5, texture o9, next o5 o9, next o12 o9 (initial).\n   - effect: vase o12 o5, deletes next o12 o9.\n\n7) wretched o5 9 8 o3\n   - flip o5 back to 8: next o5 o8.\n\n8) tightfisted o10 o5 8\n   - pre: hand o10, sneeze o5, texture o8, next o5 o8 (step 7), vase o10 o5 (step 5).\n   - effect: next o10 o8 (o10 done).\n\n9) tightfisted o12 o5 8\n   - pre: same pattern for o12 with vase from step 6 and next o5 o8.\n   - effect: next o12 o8 (o12 done).\n\n10) wretched o4 7 6 o2\n    - pre: sneeze o4, next o4 o7 (initial), collect o7 o2 and collect o6 o2, stupendous o2.\n    - effect: next o4 o6 (o4: 7 -> 6).\n\n11) clip o13 o4 6\n    - pre: hand o13, sneeze o4, texture o6, next o4 o6 (step 10), next o13 o6 (initial).\n    - effect: vase o13 o4, deletes next o13 o6.\n\n12) wretched o4 6 7 o2\n    - flip o4 back to 7: next o4 o7.\n\n13) tightfisted o13 o4 7\n    - pre: hand o13, sneeze o4, texture o7, next o4 o7 (step 12), vase o13 o4 (step 11).\n    - effect: next o13 o7 (o13 done).\n\nAfter step 13 you have:\n- next o10 o8,\n- next o11 o9,\n- next o12 o8,\n- next o13 o7.\n\nFinal note\n- If you really must have next o10 o6, next o12 o7 or next o13 o9, you cannot reach those given the current initial next values and the action schemas \u2014 the texture groups are disconnected for hands. To make the original goal possible you would need to change either the initial next edges (so a hand starts in the 6/7 group for o10 and o12 or in the 8/9 group for o13) or add an action that can move a hand across texture groups (for example an action that can create vase with a cat whose next is the desired texture without requiring matching textures first).\n\nWould you like:\n- a compact plan file in some particular format (PDDL-style, or a simple list), or\n- verification that no other sequence can reach the original goal (I can produce a short formal argument / state-space reasoning)?"

That can produce vase object_12 object_0 or object_1, but then paltry(object_12,B,7) would additionally require next B 7. B in {object_0,object_1} do not have next-to-7, and there is no way (given the available springs/collect/stupendous facts) to produce next object_0 object_7 or next object_1 object_7 (the memory operator would need a spring that does not exist).\n    - Clip(object_12,B,C) requires sneeze(B) (so B must be object_4 or object_5) and both next B C and next object_12 C. To create vase object_12 object_4 so we could later use tightfisted(12,4,7), we would need some C with next object_12 C and next object_4 C. The only initial next for object_12 is C=object_8, but next object_4 object_8 does not exist and cannot be created with the available operators/collect facts (wretched cannot produce it because the required collect facts would not match). So we cannot produce a vase object_12 B with a B that simultaneously meets the \"next B 7\" (for tightfisted) or \"cats B and next B 7\" (for paltry) requirements in a way that leads to next object_12 object_7.\n- In short: every route to get next object_12 object_7 is blocked by missing required facts (cats on object_12 or sneeze on object_12, or impossibility of producing the needed vase and corresponding next B 7), so next object_12 object_7 cannot be achieved from the given initial state with the provided operators.\n\nIf you want, I can:\n- produce the final state after executing the six actions above, or\n- try to search for any alternative trick I might have missed (but with the fixed predicate sets above the obstacle for object_12 is structural)."

    "response": "No valid plan exists \u2014 the goal next object_11 object_10 is unreachable from the given initial state and operators.\n\nSketch of the impossibility proof (concise):\n\n- Which operators can add next(11,10)?\n  - paltry(11, b, 10) would add next(11,10), but paltry requires cats(b). The only cats fact in the initial state is cats object_0, so paltry can only be used with b = object_0 (0). That instance would require next(0,10) as a precondition. From the initial state next(0,*) can only be 8 (next 0 8) and memory can only swap between 8 and 5 (springs are only 5 and 8), so next(0,10) is impossible. Hence paltry cannot produce next(11,10).\n  - tightfisted(11, b, 10) is the only remaining way to produce next(11,10). Its preconditions are:\n    hand(11) (satisfied),\n    sneeze(b) (sneeze facts exist only for b \u2208 {3,4}),\n    texture(10) (satisfied),\n    next(b,10),\n    vase(11,b).\n\n  So for success we must pick b = 3 or b = 4 and achieve both next(b,10) and vase(11,b).\n\n- Case b = 3:\n  - vase(11,3) can be produced (clip(11,3,6) is possible after making next(3,6): using the wretched chain 3: 7\u21925\u21926 we can produce next(3,6), then clip(11,3,6) yields vase(11,3)). So vase(11,3) is achievable.\n  - But next(3,10) is required as well. The only operator that creates next(3,*) is wretched with a = 3, and wretched(3,b,c,d) requires collect(b,d) and collect(c,d) for the same d. The collect facts partition objects by d: for d = 1 the collect set is {5,6,7}; for d = 2 the collect set is {8,9,10}. To get c = 10 with a = 3 you would need next(3,b) for some b in {10,8,9} so that a wretched can use d = 2, but there is no way to reach any of those b from the initial next(3,7) via the available wretched transitions (3 cycles only among {5,6,7}). Therefore next(3,10) cannot be achieved. So b = 3 fails.\n\n- Case b = 4:\n  - next(4,10) is achievable directly (wretched(4,8,10,2) is enabled by initial next(4,8), textures, stupendous(2), and collect(8,2), collect(10,2)).\n  - We also need vase(11,4). The only operators that add vase are clip and sip. sip requires cats(4) which is false (cats exists only for object_0), so sip cannot produce vase(11,4). The only remaining option is clip(11,4,c), which requires next(4,c) and next(11,c) for the same c. From the initial state the only next(11,*) fact is next(11,6), so c must be 6. Thus clip(11,4,6) would require next(4,6). However next(4,6) cannot be produced: wretched on a = 4 would require collect(8,d) (because initial next(4,8) is the starting point) and collect(6,d) for the same d; collect(8,2) and collect(6,1) have different d, so there is no wretched that yields next(4,6). Hence vase(11,4) is unattainable. So b = 4 fails.\n\nBecause both possible b values for tightfisted are ruled out and paltry is also impossible, next(11,10) cannot be reached from the given initial state with the available actions. Therefore no plan exists that achieves the goal.\n\nIf you want, I can (a) produce the longest feasible partial sequence of actions that is executable (e.g. the wretched chain for object_3 and the clip that yields vase(11,3)), or (b) try code to search exhaustively to confirm unsolvability step-by-step. Which would you prefer?"

    "response": "Short answer: There is no valid plan that achieves both goals next object_11 object_7 and next object_12 object_5 from the given initial facts and action definitions. The domain constraints create an unavoidable \u201cgrouping\u201d bottleneck that prevents making those particular next links.\n\nReasoning (concise):\n\n- Which actions can add a next fact of the form next X Y?\n  - paltry, memory, wretched and tightfisted add a next fact next object_0 object_2 (with the specific object parameters).\n  - For X = object_12 (to get next object_12 object_5) the only applicable creators are paltry (needs hand 12 and vase 12 0) or tightfisted (needs hand 12, a sneeze S, vase 12 S and next S 5). memory/wretched require object_12 to be cats or sneeze, which it is not.\n\n- Therefore to make next object_12 object_5 you must first create a vase whose first argument is object_12 (vase 12 K for some K), then apply paltry or tightfisted. vases are only created by clip or sip.\n\n- sip requires two existing next facts sharing the same target t: next 12 t and next K t \u2014 so sip cannot create a vase 12 K unless next 12 t already exists for some t (i.e. circular for our target 5).\n\n- clip creates vase 12 K if there is a sneeze K and an object t such that both next K t and next 12 t already hold. Initially next 12 points to object_10 (t = object_10). So clip could make vase 12 K only if we can make some sneeze K have next K object_10. The sneeze nodes are object_3 and object_4.\n  - object_4 can be made to point to object_10 (wretched can change its next inside the group {8,9,10}), so vase 12 4 is attainable (via wretched(4,8,10,2) then clip(12,4,10)). So vase 12 4 can be produced.\n  - But to use tightfisted(12,4,5) to get next 12 5 we need next 4 5 to hold. object_4's reachable next targets are limited to the collector-group {8,9,10} (because collect facts partition targets: {5,6,7} collected by object_1 and {8,9,10} collected by object_2). There is no way to make object_4 point to object_5 (different collector group), so next 4 5 is impossible. paltry(12,0,5) would require vase 12 0, but 0 is not a sneeze and clip cannot create vase 12 0 (clip needs a sneeze second argument), and sip would be circular as noted. Hence next object_12 object_5 cannot be achieved.\n\n- A symmetric argument blocks next object_11 object_7:\n  - Initially next 11 points to object_9 (group {8,9,10}). To get next 11 7 (group {5,6,7}) you would need paltry(11,0,7) (needs vase 11 0) or tightfisted(11,S,7) (needs vase 11 S and next S 7). clip can create vase 11 4 (by making next 4 9 and using the existing next 11 9), but then tightfisted(11,4,7) would require next 4 7, which is impossible for the same collector-group reason: object_4 cannot be made to point into {5,6,7}. sip would again require next 11 t and next 0 t for some t already present and is circular. Therefore next 11 7 cannot be achieved either.\n\n- Because each of the two goal next-facts is blocked by the same grouping/collector constraints (and the vase creation requirements), there is no sequence of actions that produces the two goal next facts from the given initial state.\n\nIf you want, I can:\n- produce a short sequence of actions that are reachable and show intermediate reachable vases/nexts (for example, you can make next 4->9 and vase 11 4, or next 4->10 and vase 12 4), to illustrate what is reachable; or\n- try a modified goal (e.g. next object_11 object_9 or next object_12 object_10) and produce a concrete valid plan to reach it."

The available actions that can set next for object_0 are paltry, wretched, memory and tightfisted.\n- wretched and memory both require either sneeze(object_0) or cats(object_0). For object_13 neither sneeze(object_13) nor cats(object_13) is true in the initial state, and there are no actions that add sneeze or cats facts. Therefore wretched and memory cannot be used with object_13 as object_0.\n- That leaves paltry and tightfisted as the only actions that could add next(13, ...). Both paltry and tightfisted require a vase(13, X) precondition:\n  - paltry requires vase(13, X) with X being a cats-object (object_1 must have cats).\n  - tightfisted requires vase(13, X) with X being a sneeze-object (object_1 must have sneeze).\n- Vase facts can only be produced by sip or clip. sip produces vase(object_0, object_1) but requires that next(object_0, Y) and next(object_1, Y) both already hold for some Y. For object_13 the only existing next is next(13,7), so to use sip to make vase(13, cat) we would need some cat object that already has next(...,7). Neither cat (only object_0 and object_1) has next(...,7) initially, and there is no way to make a cat object gain next(...,7) with the available actions and initial facts (memory could change a cat's next, but it requires spring facts that don't allow producing next(...,7) here).\n- clip can produce vase(13, X) where X is a sneeze-object (4 or 5), and we can indeed create vase(13,4) by first making next(4,7) (wretched(4,8,7,2)) and then clip(13,4,7). So vase(13,4) is reachable. However using tightfisted to turn vase(13,4) into next(13,9) requires next(4,9) to be true. Creating next(4,9) via wretched/memory/etc. is impossible given the fixed collect/spring facts (the required collect pairs to do that do not exist). In short: either paltry needs vase(13,cat) which sip can't make because cats don't have the necessary next-to-7, or tightfisted needs vase(13,sneeze) plus next(sneeze,9), and we cannot get the required next(sneeze,9) and vase combination together under the current static collect/spring facts.\n- Therefore, with the current initial facts and action definitions, I cannot produce any valid action sequence that achieves next object_13 object_9.\n\nIf you want\n- I can run an exhaustive forward search (breadth-first) through the state space to double-check reachability and either produce a proof-plan or show a counterexample that the goal is unreachable.\n- Or you can allow one small change (for example: add next(object_1,7) or add a collect fact or make object_13 sneeze or cat), and I can show a full plan that reaches both goals. Which would you prefer?"

The only operator that creates vase(..., object_0) is sip(h, object_0, t), but sip itself requires next(h, t) (so to get vase(object_12, object_0) by sip you already need next(object_12, t) \u2014 circular).\n  - tightfisted(h, s, t) which requires vase(h, s) where s is a sneeze-object, and next(s, t). vase(h, s) can only be produced by clip(h, s, t') when next(h, t') and next(s, t') hold simultaneously.\n- The sneeze objects are object_3 and object_4. By the initial facts and available wretched transitions:\n  - sneeze object_3's next can only ever be in the set {object_5, object_6, object_7} (these share collect(..., stupendous object_1)). So any tightfisted using s = object_3 can only add next(h, t) for t in {5,6,7}.\n  - sneeze object_4's next can only ever be in the set {object_8, object_9, object_10} (these share collect(..., stupendous object_2)). So any tightfisted using s = object_4 can only add next(h, t) for t in {8,9,10}.\n- object_12's initial next is next(object_12, object_6). To build vase(12, s) by clip you need a common texture t' so that next(12, t') and next(s, t') hold at the same time. The only candidate s that can match t' = object_6 is s = object_3 (because object_3 can be moved to object_6 by wretched). If you build vase(12, object_3) then tightfisted(12, object_3, t) can only yield next(12, t) with t \u2208 {5,6,7}. In particular, tightfisted cannot produce next(12, object_8) because object_8 is not in that set.\n- Trying s = object_4 would require making next(12, t') with t' \u2208 {8,9,10} before you can clip(12,4,t') to get vase(12,4). But making next(12, t') in the first place would require a vase for object_12 (paltry or tightfisted), leading back to the same circular dependencies.\n- Therefore there is no way (given the operators and initial facts) to produce next(object_12, object_8).\n\nConclusion\n- A correct plan that achieves all three goals does not exist. The two reachable goals can be achieved with the 7-step plan above; the remaining goal next(object_12, object_8) is unreachable (proof sketched above). If you want, I can:\n  - produce the full state trajectory after each action of the 7-step plan, or\n  - try alternative attempts that target object_12 and show the dead-ends in more detail.

Reasoning (short proof):\n\nWhich actions can make a new next(A,B) true?\n- paltry(A,_,B)\n- wretched(A,_,B,_)\n- memory(A,_,B)\n- tightfisted(A,_,B)\n\nSo to get next object_11 object_5 (and similarly for object_12 and object_13) we must use one of those four action types with the first parameter = the hand object (11,12 or 13). Check the preconditions for each constructor when the first parameter is one of {11,12,13}:\n\n1) memory(A,...) requires cats A. In the initial state cats is true only for object_0. cats object_11 / cats object_12 / cats object_13 are not present and no action creates cats, so memory cannot produce next for 11/12/13.\n\n2) wretched(A,...) requires sneeze A. Sneeze holds initially only for object_3 and object_4. There is no action that can make sneeze true for object_11/12/13, so wretched cannot produce next for 11/12/13.\n\n3) paltry(A, C, B) requires vase(A,C) as a precondition (plus cats C, next C B, etc.). vase facts can only be created by sip or clip. Both sip and clip require, among their preconditions, next A B' (i.e. a next with the same A as the vase\u2019s first argument) \u2014 in other words, creating a vase(A,...) via sip/clip itself requires an existing next(A, ...) fact. Thus paltry would require a vase(A,...) that cannot be created unless a next(A,...) already exists: circular/bootstrapping impossibility.\n\n4) tightfisted(A, S, B) also requires vase(A,S) as a precondition, and so faces the same circularity as paltry: vase(A,...) can only be produced by sip/clip, and those require an existing next(A,...) fact. Hence tightfisted cannot bootstrap a next(A,...) either.\n\nTherefore for each hand object A \u2208 {object_11, object_12, object_13}:\n- memory and wretched cannot be used because their required cats(A) or sneeze(A) are absent and cannot be produced;\n- paltry and tightfisted cannot be used because they require vase(A,...) which cannot be produced without an existing next(A,...) (circular dependency).\n\nHence next object_11 object_5, next object_12 object_9 and next object_13 object_10 are unreachable from the given initial facts.\n\n(As a side note: some intermediate next facts are reachable \u2014 for example memory( object_0, object_8, object_5 ) is a valid action and would produce next object_0 object_5 \u2014 and wretched can change next for objects that already have the required sneeze/cats/collect/stupendous preconditions \u2014 but none of these allow breaking the circularity described above for the three hand objects.)\n\nIf you want a plan that would make the goals achievable, I can suggest the minimal additions to the initial state that break the circularity (for example: give cats or sneeze to the relevant hand objects, or provide an initial vase for each hand object). Tell me which kind of change you prefer and I will produce a concrete plan."

    "response": "Summary: No valid plan exists from the given initial facts \u2014 each requested next(...) (next 12 6, next 13 10, next 14 11) would require creating a vase relation that itself can only be created if that next(...) (or an equivalent next with the same head) already exists. That makes each required next relation impossible to produce from the available actions and initial facts. I show the reasoning for each goal below.\n\nKey observation: the only actions that can make a next X Y true are paltry, wretched, memory and tightfisted. For each target head (12, 13, 14) you must satisfy one of those actions\u2019 preconditions. In every case the preconditions introduce a circular dependency (they require a vase that can only be produced by actions that themselves require the target next relation). Details:\n\n1) Goal next 12 6\n- To obtain next 12 6 we must run one of: paltry(12,?,6), wretched(12,?,6,?), memory(12,?,6) or tightfisted(12,?,6).\n- wretched needs sneeze 12 \u2014 false in the initial state.\n- memory needs cats 12 \u2014 false in the initial state.\n- That leaves paltry or tightfisted.\n  - paltry(12,o1,6) requires: hand 12 (true), cats o1 (only o1 = 0 or 1 possible), texture 6 (true), vase(12,o1) and next(o1,6).\n    - For cats: o1 must be 0 or 1. next(1,6) is present, so o1=1 would work for next(o1,6), but paltry additionally needs vase(12,1).\n  - tightfisted(12,o1,6) requires: hand 12 (true), sneeze o1 (only 4 or 5), texture 6 (true), next(o1,6) and vase(12,o1).\n    - next(4,6) and next(5,6) are not present initially, so tightfisted is not viable now.\n- So we are driven to need vase(12,1). How can vase(12,1) be created? Only sip or clip (or tightfisted could use an existing vase, it does not create one) can make vase facts:\n  - sip(12,1,t) requires next(12,t) as a precondition (it requires next object_0 object_2).\n  - clip(12,1,t) also requires next(12,t).\nThus creating vase(12,1) via sip/clip requires a next with head 12 to already exist (for the same object_2), in particular that would require next(12,6) (or another next(12,...) that itself depends on next(12,6) in the same circular way). Therefore vase(12,1) cannot be produced before next(12,6). That yields a circular dependency, so next 12 6 is unreachable.\n\n2) Goal next 13 10\n- wretched or memory require sneeze 13 or cats 13 \u2014 both false.\n- paltry(13,o1,10) needs hand 13 (true), cats o1 (only o1 = 0 or 1), texture 10 (true), vase(13,o1), and next(o1,10).\n  - next(0,10) and next(1,10) are both false initially, so paltry cannot be done now.\n- tightfisted(13,o1,10) needs hand 13 (true), sneeze o1 (4 or 5), texture 10 (true), next(o1,10) and vase(13,o1).\n  - next(5,10) is true initially, so tightfisted could produce next(13,10) IF we had vase(13,5).\n- How to get vase(13,5)? Only sip/clip can create vase facts.\n  - Both sip and clip creating vase(13,5) require next(13, t) for some t (they require next object_0 object_2). In particular, to create vase(13,5) via clip/sip you need a preexisting next with head 13 (e.g. next(13,10) or next(13,8)), so again creation of vase(13,5) depends on next(13,...) already existing. That is circular with the desired next(13,10). So next 13 10 is unreachable.\n\n3) Goal next 14 11\n- Similar reasoning as for 13: wretched/memory require sneeze14 or cats14 \u2014 false.\n- paltry(14,o1,11) needs vase(14,o1) and next(o1,11) where cats(o1) must hold (cats only 0 or 1); neither next(0,11) nor next(1,11) is present initially, so paltry cannot run now.\n- tightfisted(14,o1,11) would need vase(14,o1) and next(o1,11) with sneeze o1 (4 or 5). If we pick o1=5, next(5,11) is not initially present (it is possible to create some next(5,11) via wretched, but vase(14,5) is still required).\n- vase(14,5) can only be created by sip/clip, which again require a preexisting next with head 14 (circular).\nSo next 14 11 is also unreachable.\n\nConclusion\nEach goal next(head, target) requires a vase(head, ...) that can only be produced by sip/clip, and sip/clip demand a next with the same head already exist (or other preconditions that reduce to the same circularity). The other next-producing actions (wretched, memory) are unusable for these heads because the actions require sneeze or cats facts for the head objects which the initial state does not supply. Therefore there is no sequence of the given actions that can attain next 12 6, next 13 10 and next 14 11 from the given initial state.\n\nIf you want, I can:\n- show the small proof graph of dependencies,\n- search for any alternative indirect sequences (but I\u2019m confident none exist given the circular dependencies described), or\n- suggest minimal changes to the initial facts (e.g., add cats object_12 or sneeze object_12 or add an initial vase for some hand) that would make the goals achievable \u2014 and then produce a concrete plan for that modified instance. Which would you prefer?"

The four-step sequence is valid and each precondition is satisfied at the time the action is applied.\n\nWhy next object_13 object_10 and next object_14 object_9 cannot be achieved\n- Any operator that can create or change next X Y for X = object_13 or object_14 must either (a) have object_13/object_14 as the first parameter of an operator that produces next object_0 object_2 (paltry, memory, wretched, tightfisted), or (b) indirectly produce a vase needed by paltry/tightfisted and then use paltry/tightfisted to change the next-link.\n- memory and wretched require cats(object_*) or sneeze(object_*), respectively, on the first parameter. object_13 and object_14 are not listed as cats or sneeze in the initial facts, so memory and wretched cannot be applied with object_0 = object_13 or object_14.\n- That leaves paltry and tightfisted to change next for object_13 or object_14. Both paltry and tightfisted require vase object_13 <something> or vase object_14 <something>.\n- The only operators that create vase facts are sip and clip:\n  - sip requires cats on its second parameter (only object_0 and object_1 are cats). To create vase object_14 object_1 (with object_1 = 0 or 1) sip needs next object_14 Z and next object_1 Z for the same Z. In the initial state next object_14 points to 8, next object_0 points to 6 and next object_1 points to 9. Memory can only change next for object_0/object_1 to spring targets (6 or 9), so you cannot make next object_0 or next object_1 point to 8. Therefore you cannot create a vase for object_14 by sip.\n  - clip requires the second parameter to be a sneeze object (4 or 5). For clip to create vase object_14 5 it would need some Z with next object_5 Z and next object_14 Z. That would require making next object_5 point to 8 (to match next object_14's 8). With the available collect/spring/stupendous facts you cannot make next object_5 point to 8 (the necessary collect facts are absent), so clip cannot create the required vase either.\n- Similar constraints block creation of the vase(s) needed to set next object_13 object_10. While sip(13,0,6) is possible and does create vase object_13 object_0, turning that into next object_13 object_10 would still require next object_0 object_10 (or other matching next facts) that are not reachable because memory can only set next object_0 to spring targets (6 or 9), not to 10, and the other operators cannot produce the needed next links without circular dependencies on vases that cannot be produced.\n- In short: for object_13 and object_14 the only operators that can establish the needed next-links require vase facts that cannot be produced given the initial next/collect/spring/stupendous/texture facts. Attempts to create those vases run into circular requirements (they would require next-links that themselves require those vases), or into missing collect/spring facts that wretched would need to produce necessary intermediate next-links.\n\nIf you want\n- I can produce a formal unreachable-proof style (listing which preconditions are impossible to satisfy),\n- or I can search for any alternative sequences if you are willing to relax or add an initial fact (for example, adding next object_14 object_9 or a collect/spring that would enable a necessary wretched)."

To change the \"next\" link of a hand object (like object_14) you must (in this domain) either:\n  - have a vase linking that hand to a sneeze object S and have S currently point to the desired target (so tightfisted hand S target works), or\n  - have a vase linking that hand to the cats object_0 and have object_0 currently point to the desired target (so paltry can produce it).\n- For next object_14 object_7 you would need either a sneeze S with next S object_7 (S must be object_3 to reach 7 because only object_3 can point to members of {5,6,7}), and also a vase object_14 object_3; or you would need next object_0 object_7 and vase object_14 object_0.\n- Given the available operators and the initial facts, there is no way to produce a vase object_14 object_3 (clip requires some object X that both object_14 and object_3 currently point to \u2014 no such X is available or can be constructed without circularity), and memory can only change next object_0 between object_5 and object_8 (springs), so object_0 cannot be made to point to object_7. Therefore next object_14 object_7 is not reachable under the given operators and initial facts (while the other three goal edges are reachable and achieved by the plan above).\n\nIf you want, I can:\n- try to find any additional operator sequences that might make next object_14 object_7 reachable if you change/relax some initial facts (e.g., add a spring or collect relation), or\n- produce a step-by-step state trace (listing which next / vase facts are added/deleted) so you can verify every intermediate state."

The only cats is object_0; next object_0 can only ever be object_8 or object_5 (memory only toggles between springs 8 and 5), so paltry can only put a hand\u2019s next to 5 or 8, never to 10.\n  - tightfisted(h, s, t) adds next h t but requires vase(h, s) and next(s, t) with s a sneeze. So to get t = object_10 via tightfisted we need:\n    - a sneeze s with next s object_10 (only sneeze object_4 initially has next -> object_10), and\n    - a vase(h, s) (i.e., vase(h,4)).\n- The only action that creates vase(h,4) is clip(h,4,t), but clip requires next(h,t) and next(4,t) already be true for the same t. For t = object_10 this is circular (next(h,10) would have to already exist). For t in {object_8,object_9,object_10} (the textures 4 can have via wretched), either:\n  - t = object_10: circular, or\n  - t = object_8 or object_9: to make next(h,8) or next(h,9) we would need paltry or tightfisted to add them, but paltry can only place hands on 5 or 8 if vase(h,0) exists and that vase(h,0) can only be created by sip when hand h already shares next with object_0 \u2014 leading back to the same dependency; tightfisted would need vase(h,s') first. All alternatives are circular or blocked by the limited domain of next(object_0,...).\n- In short: there is no non-circular way to produce vase(object_11, object_4) or vase(object_13, object_4) given the initial next facts and available operators. Without such a vase, tightfisted cannot place next object_11 object_10 or next object_13 object_10.\n\nConclusion\n- Feasible, non-circular plan above achieves next object_12 object_6 and next object_14 object_7.\n- next object_11 object_10 and next object_13 object_10 are unreachable from the given initial facts and operators (reason sketched above). If you want, I can (a) produce a formal unreachable proof (showing the invariants), or (b) search again if you add/change initial facts (e.g., allow next object_0 object_10 or add a sneeze with next->10 that can be used differently)."
