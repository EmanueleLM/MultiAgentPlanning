These restorations are explicit effects of wretched and memory actions in the trace; they are observable state transitions (not implicit bookkeeping). Auditor/validator might flag such deletions+restorations as bookkeeping shortcuts, but in this trace they are produced by legitimate action effects.\n- Vase facts are frequently produced and consumed (e.g., vase object_10 object_4 created at Step 2 and deleted at Step 4); tracking these ephemeral vase relations is essential to validate chained actions.\n- The per-action stage precondition (current stage_i and succ stage_i stage_j) is satisfied at every step because the plan's stage arguments provide a contiguous stage progression.\n\nSummary\n- The plan precisely executes 21 steps (stage_0 → stage_21).\n- Each step’s required ground preconditions were present at execution time; each step’s effects update the state consistently.\n- The final state contains the required goal next relations: next object_10 object_6, next object_11 object_7, next object_12 object_7, next object_9 object_6.\n\nIf you want, I can convert this narration into a compact table, or produce a single-line human-readable sentence per step (e.g., “t1: sip(object_9,object_0,object_7) — consumed next(9,7), produced vase(9,0)”), or produce an explicit state snapshot after each step.

No actions were added or removed.\n- Each step lists the grounded preconditions and effects derived from the domain specification for the corresponding schema (clip, wretched, tightfisted).\n- The plan is temporally and causally consistent under the domain model: every precondition used by an action is satisfied by initial facts or by effects of earlier actions in the trace.\n- Final goals achieved (explicitly produced by the steps above):\n  - next object_11 object_7 (produced at Step 6)\n  - next object_12 object_8 (produced at Step 10)\n  - next object_12 object_10 (produced at Step 12)\n  - next object_13 object_9 (produced at Step 8)\n- Reported plan cost (from the original plan): 12 (unit cost).\n\nIf you want, I can also produce a compact table of predicate-state changes over time (showing the state of relevant next/ vase facts before and after each step) to further illustrate how the goals are reached.",
