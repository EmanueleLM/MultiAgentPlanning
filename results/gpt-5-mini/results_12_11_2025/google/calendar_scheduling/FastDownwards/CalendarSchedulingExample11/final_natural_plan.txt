Step 1 — schedule(meeting1, s13, alexander, elizabeth, walter)
- Action: Schedule "meeting1" for Alexander, Elizabeth, and Walter.
- Time slot: s13 = Monday 15:00–15:30 (30 minutes).
- Preconditions satisfied: the meeting was not yet scheduled, the three participants are distinct, and each was free at s13.
- Effects: The meeting is now scheduled at 15:00–15:30; Alexander, Elizabeth, and Walter are marked occupied for that slot (their free status for s13 is removed).
- Goal achieved: meeting1 is scheduled at s13 (Monday 15:00–15:30).
