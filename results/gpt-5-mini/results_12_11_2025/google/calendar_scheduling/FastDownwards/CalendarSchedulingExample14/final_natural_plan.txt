Step 1 — Action: choose-slot s1500_1530 t1500 t1530 bradley brandon jerry

- What this does: Schedule the 30-minute meeting in slot s1500_1530 (15:00–15:30).
- Time span: t1500 → t1530 (15:00 to 15:30), duration 30 minutes.
- Participants (as given in the action parameters): Bradley, Brandon, Jerry.
- Preconditions met (checked before scheduling): the slot is within work hours (09:00–17:00), the slot starts at 15:00 and ends at 15:30 (a single 30-minute granularity step), and Bradley, Brandon, and Jerry are free at that slot; no meeting was already scheduled.
- Effects (results of the action): the meeting is now scheduled; slot s1500_1530 is chosen; s1500_1530 is no longer marked free for Bradley, Brandon, or Jerry.
- Notes: This chosen slot (15:00–15:30) is consistent with all calendars and respects Brandon’s stated soft preference to avoid meetings before 14:30.  

Goal achieved: (scheduled) and (chosen s1500_1530).
