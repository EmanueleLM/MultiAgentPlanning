Step 1 — Schedule meeting (12:00–12:30, Monday; duration 30 minutes)
- Action: Schedule the meeting at timeslot t1200 (12:00–12:30).
- Participants: Margaret, Donna, Helen.
- Justification / Preconditions satisfied:
  - t1200 was audited as feasible (intersection of availabilities) and is the earliest audited feasible slot.
  - Margaret, Donna, and Helen are all free at t1200.
  - Helen’s preference (no meetings after 13:30) is respected — this slot ends well before 13:30.
- Effects:
  - The meeting is now scheduled at 12:00–12:30.
  - Margaret, Donna, and Helen are no longer free at that timeslot.
