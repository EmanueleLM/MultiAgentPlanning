1) Schedule meeting — Monday 14:30–15:00 (30 minutes) for Roy, Kathryn, and Amy.
   - Action taken: schedule-meeting slot_14_30_15_00
   - Time: 14:30 to 15:00 (duration 30 minutes)
   - Rationale: slot_14_30_15_00 is free for Roy, Kathryn, and Amy (free-all) and has been marked allowed after auditing; it does not violate Amy’s soft preference (she prefers not to meet after 15:30).
   - Outcome: meeting-scheduled; scheduled-at slot_14_30_15_00.

This single step completes the goal: a 30-minute meeting for Roy, Kathryn, and Amy is scheduled on Monday.
