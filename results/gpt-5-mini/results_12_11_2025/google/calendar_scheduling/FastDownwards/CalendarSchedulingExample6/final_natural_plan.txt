1) Action: schedule-meeting slot1430 slot1500 thomas dylan jerry
   - Natural-language: Schedule a 60-minute meeting for Thomas, Dylan, and Jerry starting at 14:30 on Monday.
   - Time window: 14:30–15:30 (this occupies the two 30-minute slots 14:30–15:00 and 15:00–15:30).
   - Preconditions satisfied: slot1430 was marked as the earliest feasible start; all three participants were required, distinct, and free at both slot1430 and slot1500.
   - Effects (result): the meeting is recorded as scheduled (meeting_scheduled), the scheduled start is 14:30, and the 14:30 and 15:00 slots are no longer free for Thomas, Dylan, and Jerry.
