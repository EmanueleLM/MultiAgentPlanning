Step 1 — Action: (schedule_meeting t1200)

- What is done: Schedule a 30-minute meeting for Heather, Nicholas, and Zachary.
- When: Monday, 12:00–12:30 (timeslot t1200).
- Duration: 30 minutes.
- Justification/feasibility:
  - Heather: not busy at t1200 (Heather's busy slots: 09:00, 10:30, 13:00, 13:30, 14:30, 16:00).
  - Nicholas: no meetings on Monday (free at t1200).
  - Zachary: not busy at t1200 (Zachary's busy slots include 09:00–10:30, 11:00–12:00, 12:30–13:00, 13:30–16:30; t1200 is free).
  - The slot is inside the work window 09:00–17:00 and lasts the required 30 minutes.
  - Respects Zachary's soft preference to avoid times after 14:00 (selected time is before 14:00).
- Effects:
  - meeting_scheduled becomes true.
  - scheduled_at t1200 becomes true.
