Step 1 — schedule-meeting s5
- Action (PDDL): (schedule-meeting s5)
- Human-readable: Schedule a 30-minute meeting on Monday from 11:00 to 11:30 with Adam, Jerry, and Matthew.
- Duration / timestamp: 11:00–11:30 (30 minutes)
- Preconditions checked: s5 is within work hours (09:00–17:00) and s5 is not busy for Adam, Jerry, or Matthew.
- Effects (what this action establishes):
  - meeting-scheduled is true.
  - meeting is scheduled at 11:00–11:30.
  - Adam, Jerry, and Matthew are now busy for 11:00–11:30.
- Rationale / audit: The auditor’s intersection showed s5 (11:00–11:30) is free for all three participants, so scheduling at s5 satisfies the goal.
- Goal status after this step: Goal achieved — a 30-minute Monday meeting is scheduled for Adam, Jerry, and Matthew at 11:00–11:30.
