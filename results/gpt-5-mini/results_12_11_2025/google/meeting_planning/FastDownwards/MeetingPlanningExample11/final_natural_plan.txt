Summary:
- The plan departs Nob Hill at 09:00, arrives Sunset District by 09:30 (travel cost 25 minutes, charged once).
- The agent waits at Sunset District through 14:00, then meets Carol for three contiguous 30‑minute slots (14:00–15:30), totaling 90 minutes contiguous meeting time (which satisfies the requirement of at least 75 minutes).
- All meeting slots fall inside Carol’s availability window (14:00–20:30).
- Total minimized objective (total-cost) = 25 (minutes of travel).
