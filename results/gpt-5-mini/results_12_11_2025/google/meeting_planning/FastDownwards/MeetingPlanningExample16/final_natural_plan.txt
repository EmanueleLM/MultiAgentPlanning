1) choose-best(schedule_full375)
- Action: Select the audited schedule named "schedule_full375" as the best schedule to follow.
- Rationale: This schedule provides the maximum contiguous meeting duration with Ronald (it covers his entire availability window) and therefore satisfies the traveler's hard requirement to meet Ronald for at least 105 minutes.
- Note on timing: selection is a logical decision (no time duration itself).

2) execute-meeting(schedule_full375)
- Action: Carry out the meeting defined by "schedule_full375": meet Ronald continuously at Russian Hill from 15:15 to 21:30.
- Duration: 375 minutes (6 hours 15 minutes), which exceeds the required minimum of 105 minutes.
- Practical timing detail: to be present at Russian Hill by 15:15, depart Chinatown at 15:08 (Chinatown → Russian Hill travel time = 7 minutes) unless already at Russian Hill earlier.

Result: The selected schedule (schedule_full375) is chosen and executed; the goal is achieved — Ronald is met for the required (and maximized) contiguous duration.
