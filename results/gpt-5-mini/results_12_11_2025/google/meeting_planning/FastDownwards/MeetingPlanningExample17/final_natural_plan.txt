Below is a human-readable, step-by-step rendering of the PDDL plan. It follows the plan exactly: the long initial wait at Alamo Square is represented in the PDDL plan as minute-by-minute "stay" actions (t540->t541, t541->t542, …, t793->t794). I describe that block as the equivalent continuous waiting period but note it corresponds to 254 individual one-minute stay actions in the plan. All other actions (travel, start-meet, each minute of the meeting, and the finish-meet) are listed individually and with timestamps.

1–254. Stay at Alamo Square (minute-by-minute):
- Remain at Alamo Square continuously from 09:00 to 13:14.  
  (In the PDDL plan this is implemented as 254 consecutive one-minute stay actions: stay alamo_square t540→t541, t541→t542, …, t793→t794.)

255. Travel: depart Alamo Square for Sunset District
- Action: travel alamo_square → sunset_district
- Departure timeslot: t794 (13:14)
- Travel duration: 16 minutes (directed travel)
- Arrival timeslot: t810 (13:30)
- Note: This corresponds exactly to the travel action (travel alamo_square sunset_district t794 t795 … t810) in the plan.

256. Start meeting with Matthew
- Action: start-meet
- Timestamp: t810 (13:30)
- Location: Sunset District
- Person: Matthew

268. Stay at Sunset District (13:41 → 13:42)
- Action: stay sunset_district t821 → t822

269. Stay at Sunset District (13:42 → 13:43)
- Action: stay sunset_district t822 → t823

270. Stay at Sunset District (13:43 → 13:44)
- Action: stay sunset_district t823 → t824

271. Stay at Sunset District (13:44 → 13:45)
- Action: stay sunset_district t824 → t825

272. Finish meeting with Matthew (meeting lasted 15 minutes)

- Finish timestamp: t825 (13:45)

Summary / correspondence to the PDDL plan:
- The plan begins with 254 one-minute stay actions at Alamo Square from 09:00 (t540) through departure at 13:14 (t794). I summarized those stays as a continuous wait but they map exactly to the sequence stay alamo_square t540 t541, stay alamo_square t541 t542, …, stay alamo_square t793 t794 in the PDDL plan.
- Then the plan performs the single travel action departing t794 and arriving t810 (13:30).
- The meeting is started at 13:30 (t810), followed by 15 one-minute stay actions at Sunset District covering 13:30–13:45 (t810→t825), and then finish-meet at 13:45 (t825) which records that Matthew has been met.
- This sequence exactly matches the PDDL plan and satisfies the goal: meet Matthew for at least 15 minutes during his availability window (13:30–14:30).
