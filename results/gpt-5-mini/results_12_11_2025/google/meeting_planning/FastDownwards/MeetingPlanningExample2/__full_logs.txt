Action: at-richmond. Cumulative minutes-from-midnight: 540.\n- Wait in Richmond until departure at 16:53.\n  - 16:53 (1013): Depart Richmond District. Action: travel-richmond-to-financial. Travel duration: 22 minutes (graph: richmond->financial = 22).\n- 17:15 (1035): Arrive at Financial District. Action: at-financial.

This satisfies the requirement of at least 60 minutes and maximizes meeting minutes within Betty's availability window (17:15\u201321:45).\n- End time: 21:45 (1305). Optionally, travel back afterwards (not required to satisfy goal).\n\nSummary of key times (minutes-from-midnight):\n- Start: 09:00 = 540\n- Depart Richmond: 16:53 = 1013\n- Arrive Financial: 17:15 = 1035\n- Meeting start: 1035\n- Meeting end: 1305\n- Meeting total: 270 minutes\n\nRationale: Leaving Richmond at 16:53 arrives exactly at Betty's earliest availability (17:15). Staying continuously until 21:45 yields the maximum feasible meeting time (270 minutes), which both satisfies the minimum 60-minute requirement and maximizes met-betty under the given constraints and travel times."

    "proposed_solution": "I will remain in Richmond District until late afternoon, then travel to Financial District to meet Betty as soon as she becomes available and stay until her availability ends.\n\nSchedule (chronological steps):\n- 09:00 (540): Arrive and start at Richmond District. Action: at-richmond. Cumulative minutes-from-midnight: 540.\n- Wait in Richmond until departure at 16:53.\n  - 16:53 (1013): Depart Richmond District. Action: travel-richmond-to-financial. Travel duration: 22 minutes (graph: richmond->financial = 22).\n- 17:15 (1035): Arrive at Financial District. Action: at-financial.

This satisfies the requirement of at least 60 minutes and maximizes meeting minutes within Betty's availability window (17:15\u201321:45).\n- End time: 21:45 (1305). Optionally, travel back afterwards (not required to satisfy goal).\n\nSummary of key times (minutes-from-midnight):\n- Start: 09:00 = 540\n- Depart Richmond: 16:53 = 1013\n- Arrive Financial: 17:15 = 1035\n- Meeting start: 1035\n- Meeting end: 1305\n- Meeting total: 270 minutes\n\nRationale: Leaving Richmond at 16:53 arrives exactly at Betty's earliest availability (17:15). Staying continuously until 21:45 yields the maximum feasible meeting time (270 minutes), which both satisfies the minimum 60-minute requirement and maximizes met-betty under the given constraints and travel times."

Encode locations as predicates (at-richmond) and (at-financial) that are mutually exclusive. Provide actions for traveling between districts with numeric time increases matching the graph, a small wait action (e.g., wait-5) to advance time, and meeting actions (meet-betty-60 and meet-betty-15) that increase both time and met-betty subject to the availability window. Include initial time 540 (09:00), availability window start 1035 (17:15), end 1305 (21:45), and a goal that requires met-betty >= 60 and time <= 1305. Add a metric to maximize met-betty.",

    "proposed_solution": "I will remain in Richmond District until late afternoon, then travel to Financial District to meet Betty as soon as she becomes available and stay until her availability ends.\n\nSchedule (chronological steps):\n- 09:00 (540): Arrive and start at Richmond District. Action: at-richmond. Cumulative minutes-from-midnight: 540.\n- Wait in Richmond until departure at 16:53.\n  - 16:53 (1013): Depart Richmond District. Action: travel-richmond-to-financial. Travel duration: 22 minutes (graph: richmond->financial = 22).\n- 17:15 (1035): Arrive at Financial District. Action: at-financial. (1013 + 22 = 1035)\n- 17:15\u201321:45 (1035\u20131305): Meet Betty at Financial District. Total meeting duration = 270 minutes (4 hours 30 minutes). This satisfies the requirement of at least 60 minutes and maximizes meeting minutes within Betty's availability window (17:15\u201321:45).\n- End time: 21:45 (1305). Optionally, travel back afterwards (not required to satisfy goal).\n\nSummary of key times (minutes-from-midnight):\n- Start: 09:00 = 540\n- Depart Richmond: 16:53 = 1013\n- Arrive Financial: 17:15 = 1035\n- Meeting start: 1035\n- Meeting end: 1305\n- Meeting total: 270 minutes\n\nRationale: Leaving Richmond at 16:53 arrives exactly at Betty's earliest availability (17:15). Staying continuously until 21:45 yields the maximum feasible meeting time (270 minutes), which both satisfies the minimum 60-minute requirement and maximizes met-betty under the given constraints and travel times."

    "proposed_solution": "I will remain in Richmond District until late afternoon, then travel to Financial District to meet Betty as soon as she becomes available and stay until her availability ends.\n\nSchedule (chronological steps):\n- 09:00 (540): Arrive and start at Richmond District. Action: at-richmond. Cumulative minutes-from-midnight: 540.\n- Wait in Richmond until departure at 16:53.\n  - 16:53 (1013): Depart Richmond District. Action: travel-richmond-to-financial. Travel duration: 22 minutes (graph: richmond->financial = 22).\n- 17:15 (1035): Arrive at Financial District. Action: at-financial. (1013 + 22 = 1035)\n- 17:15\u201321:45 (1035\u20131305): Meet Betty at Financial District. Total meeting duration = 270 minutes (4 hours 30 minutes). This satisfies the requirement of at least 60 minutes and maximizes meeting minutes within Betty's availability window (17:15\u201321:45).\n- End time: 21:45 (1305). Optionally, travel back afterwards (not required to satisfy goal).\n\nSummary of key times (minutes-from-midnight):\n- Start: 09:00 = 540\n- Depart Richmond: 16:53 = 1013\n- Arrive Financial: 17:15 = 1035\n- Meeting start: 1035\n- Meeting end: 1305\n- Meeting total: 270 minutes\n\nRationale: Leaving Richmond at 16:53 arrives exactly at Betty's earliest availability (17:15). Staying continuously until 21:45 yields the maximum feasible meeting time (270 minutes), which both satisfies the minimum 60-minute requirement and maximizes met-betty under the given constraints and travel times."

    "proposed_solution": "I will remain in Richmond District until late afternoon, then travel to Financial District to meet Betty as soon as she becomes available and stay until her availability ends.\n\nSchedule (chronological steps):\n- 09:00 (540): Arrive and start at Richmond District. Action: at-richmond. Cumulative minutes-from-midnight: 540.\n- Wait in Richmond until departure at 16:53.\n  - 16:53 (1013): Depart Richmond District. Action: travel-richmond-to-financial. Travel duration: 22 minutes (graph: richmond->financial = 22).\n- 17:15 (1035): Arrive at Financial District. Action: at-financial. (1013 + 22 = 1035)\n- 17:15\u201321:45 (1035\u20131305): Meet Betty at Financial District. Total meeting duration = 270 minutes (4 hours 30 minutes). This satisfies the requirement of at least 60 minutes and maximizes meeting minutes within Betty's availability window (17:15\u201321:45).\n- End time: 21:45 (1305). Optionally, travel back afterwards (not required to satisfy goal).\n\nSummary of key times (minutes-from-midnight):\n- Start: 09:00 = 540\n- Depart Richmond: 16:53 = 1013\n- Arrive Financial: 17:15 = 1035\n- Meeting start: 1035\n- Meeting end: 1305\n- Meeting total: 270 minutes\n\nRationale: Leaving Richmond at 16:53 arrives exactly at Betty's earliest availability (17:15). Staying continuously until 21:45 yields the maximum feasible meeting time (270 minutes), which both satisfies the minimum 60-minute requirement and maximizes met-betty under the given constraints and travel times."

    "proposed_solution": "I will remain in Richmond District until late afternoon, then travel to Financial District to meet Betty as soon as she becomes available and stay until her availability ends.\n\nSchedule (chronological steps):\n- 09:00 (540): Arrive and start at Richmond District. Action: at-richmond. Cumulative minutes-from-midnight: 540.\n- Wait in Richmond until departure at 16:53.\n  - 16:53 (1013): Depart Richmond District. Action: travel-richmond-to-financial. Travel duration: 22 minutes (graph: richmond->financial = 22).\n- 17:15 (1035): Arrive at Financial District. Action: at-financial. (1013 + 22 = 1035)\n- 17:15\u201321:45 (1035\u20131305): Meet Betty at Financial District. Total meeting duration = 270 minutes (4 hours 30 minutes). This satisfies the requirement of at least 60 minutes and maximizes meeting minutes within Betty's availability window (17:15\u201321:45).\n- End time: 21:45 (1305). Optionally, travel back afterwards (not required to satisfy goal).\n\nSummary of key times (minutes-from-midnight):\n- Start: 09:00 = 540\n- Depart Richmond: 16:53 = 1013\n- Arrive Financial: 17:15 = 1035\n- Meeting start: 1035\n- Meeting end: 1305\n- Meeting total: 270 minutes\n\nRationale: Leaving Richmond at 16:53 arrives exactly at Betty's earliest availability (17:15). Staying continuously until 21:45 yields the maximum feasible meeting time (270 minutes), which both satisfies the minimum 60-minute requirement and maximizes met-betty under the given constraints and travel times."

    "proposed_solution": "I will remain in Richmond District until late afternoon, then travel to Financial District to meet Betty as soon as she becomes available and stay until her availability ends.\n\nSchedule (chronological steps):\n- 09:00 (540): Arrive and start at Richmond District. Action: at-richmond. Cumulative minutes-from-midnight: 540.\n- Wait in Richmond until departure at 16:53.\n  - 16:53 (1013): Depart Richmond District. Action: travel-richmond-to-financial. Travel duration: 22 minutes (graph: richmond->financial = 22).\n- 17:15 (1035): Arrive at Financial District. Action: at-financial. (1013 + 22 = 1035)\n- 17:15\u201321:45 (1035\u20131305): Meet Betty at Financial District. Total meeting duration = 270 minutes (4 hours 30 minutes). This satisfies the requirement of at least 60 minutes and maximizes meeting minutes within Betty's availability window (17:15\u201321:45).\n- End time: 21:45 (1305). Optionally, travel back afterwards (not required to satisfy goal).\n\nSummary of key times (minutes-from-midnight):\n- Start: 09:00 = 540\n- Depart Richmond: 16:53 = 1013\n- Arrive Financial: 17:15 = 1035\n- Meeting start: 1035\n- Meeting end: 1305\n- Meeting total: 270 minutes\n\nRationale: Leaving Richmond at 16:53 arrives exactly at Betty's earliest availability (17:15). Staying continuously until 21:45 yields the maximum feasible meeting time (270 minutes), which both satisfies the minimum 60-minute requirement and maximizes met-betty under the given constraints and travel times."

    "proposed_solution": "I will remain in Richmond District until late afternoon, then travel to Financial District to meet Betty as soon as she becomes available and stay until her availability ends.\n\nSchedule (chronological steps):\n- 09:00 (540): Arrive and start at Richmond District. Action: at-richmond. Cumulative minutes-from-midnight: 540.\n- Wait in Richmond until departure at 16:53.\n  - 16:53 (1013): Depart Richmond District. Action: travel-richmond-to-financial. Travel duration: 22 minutes (graph: richmond->financial = 22).\n- 17:15 (1035): Arrive at Financial District. Action: at-financial. (1013 + 22 = 1035)\n- 17:15\u201321:45 (1035\u20131305): Meet Betty at Financial District. Total meeting duration = 270 minutes (4 hours 30 minutes). This satisfies the requirement of at least 60 minutes and maximizes meeting minutes within Betty's availability window (17:15\u201321:45).\n- End time: 21:45 (1305). Optionally, travel back afterwards (not required to satisfy goal).\n\nSummary of key times (minutes-from-midnight):\n- Start: 09:00 = 540\n- Depart Richmond: 16:53 = 1013\n- Arrive Financial: 17:15 = 1035\n- Meeting start: 1035\n- Meeting end: 1305\n- Meeting total: 270 minutes\n\nRationale: Leaving Richmond at 16:53 arrives exactly at Betty's earliest availability (17:15). Staying continuously until 21:45 yields the maximum feasible meeting time (270 minutes), which both satisfies the minimum 60-minute requirement and maximizes met-betty under the given constraints and travel times."

    "proposed_solution": "I will remain in Richmond District until late afternoon, then travel to Financial District to meet Betty as soon as she becomes available and stay until her availability ends.\n\nSchedule (chronological steps):\n- 09:00 (540): Arrive and start at Richmond District. Action: at-richmond. Cumulative minutes-from-midnight: 540.\n- Wait in Richmond until departure at 16:53.\n  - 16:53 (1013): Depart Richmond District. Action: travel-richmond-to-financial. Travel duration: 22 minutes (graph: richmond->financial = 22).\n- 17:15 (1035): Arrive at Financial District. Action: at-financial. (1013 + 22 = 1035)\n- 17:15\u201321:45 (1035\u20131305): Meet Betty at Financial District. Total meeting duration = 270 minutes (4 hours 30 minutes). This satisfies the requirement of at least 60 minutes and maximizes meeting minutes within Betty's availability window (17:15\u201321:45).\n- End time: 21:45 (1305). Optionally, travel back afterwards (not required to satisfy goal).\n\nSummary of key times (minutes-from-midnight):\n- Start: 09:00 = 540\n- Depart Richmond: 16:53 = 1013\n- Arrive Financial: 17:15 = 1035\n- Meeting start: 1035\n- Meeting end: 1305\n- Meeting total: 270 minutes\n\nRationale: Leaving Richmond at 16:53 arrives exactly at Betty's earliest availability (17:15). Staying continuously until 21:45 yields the maximum feasible meeting time (270 minutes), which both satisfies the minimum 60-minute requirement and maximizes met-betty under the given constraints and travel times."

    "proposed_solution": "I will remain in Richmond District until late afternoon, then travel to Financial District to meet Betty as soon as she becomes available and stay until her availability ends.\n\nSchedule (chronological steps):\n- 09:00 (540): Arrive and start at Richmond District. Action: at-richmond. Cumulative minutes-from-midnight: 540.\n- Wait in Richmond until departure at 16:53.\n  - 16:53 (1013): Depart Richmond District. Action: travel-richmond-to-financial. Travel duration: 22 minutes (graph: richmond->financial = 22).\n- 17:15 (1035): Arrive at Financial District. Action: at-financial. (1013 + 22 = 1035)\n- 17:15\u201321:45 (1035\u20131305): Meet Betty at Financial District. Total meeting duration = 270 minutes (4 hours 30 minutes). This satisfies the requirement of at least 60 minutes and maximizes meeting minutes within Betty's availability window (17:15\u201321:45).\n- End time: 21:45 (1305). Optionally, travel back afterwards (not required to satisfy goal).\n\nSummary of key times (minutes-from-midnight):\n- Start: 09:00 = 540\n- Depart Richmond: 16:53 = 1013\n- Arrive Financial: 17:15 = 1035\n- Meeting start: 1035\n- Meeting end: 1305\n- Meeting total: 270 minutes\n\nRationale: Leaving Richmond at 16:53 arrives exactly at Betty's earliest availability (17:15). Staying continuously until 21:45 yields the maximum feasible meeting time (270 minutes), which both satisfies the minimum 60-minute requirement and maximizes met-betty under the given constraints and travel times."
