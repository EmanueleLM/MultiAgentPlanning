Summary / compliance notes:
- Per-day assignment: Day1–Day3 = Prague; Day4–Day6 = Vienna (Day4–6 in plan: Day4 assigned to Vienna, Day5 & Day6 stayed); Day7–Day9 = Porto.
- Flights used (direct only): Prague → Vienna (on Day 4), Vienna → Porto (on Day 7). These are consistent with the allowed direct-flight graph (Prague↔Vienna and Vienna↔Porto). No Prague↔Porto direct flight was used.
- Hard constraints respected: Workshop in Prague on Days 1–3 satisfied.
- Total plan actions match the provided PDDL plan exactly (9 actions). Total unit cost reported in plan: 9.
