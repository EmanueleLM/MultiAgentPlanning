Initial state: Day 1 = Reykjavik.

Plan steps (each action corresponds exactly to one assign-next step in the PDDL plan). Each step assigns the city for the successor day; when a city changes it is executed as a direct flight on the morning of the successor day. Each step occupies one full day (the successor day).

1) (assign-next day1 day2 reykjavik reykjavik)  
   - Action: Assign Day 2 = Reykjavik (stay).  
   - Description/timing: Remain in Reykjavik for Day 2 (no flight).

2) (assign-next day2 day3 reykjavik vienna)  
   - Action: Assign Day 3 = Vienna.  
   - Description/timing: On the morning between Day 2 and Day 3 take a direct flight Reykjavik → Vienna; spend Day 3 in Vienna.

3) (assign-next day3 day4 vienna vienna)  
   - Action: Assign Day 4 = Vienna (stay).  
   - Description/timing: Remain in Vienna for Day 4.

4) (assign-next day4 day5 vienna vienna)  
   - Action: Assign Day 5 = Vienna (stay).  
   - Description/timing: Remain in Vienna for Day 5.

5) (assign-next day5 day6 vienna vienna)  
   - Action: Assign Day 6 = Vienna (stay).  
   - Description/timing: Remain in Vienna for Day 6.

6) (assign-next day6 day7 vienna vienna)  
   - Action: Assign Day 7 = Vienna (stay).  
   - Description/timing: Remain in Vienna for Day 7.

7) (assign-next day7 day8 vienna venice)  
   - Action: Assign Day 8 = Venice.  
   - Description/timing: On the morning between Day 7 and Day 8 take a direct flight Vienna → Venice; spend Day 8 in Venice.

8) (assign-next day8 day9 venice venice)  
   - Action: Assign Day 9 = Venice (stay).  
   - Description/timing: Remain in Venice for Day 9.

9) (assign-next day9 day10 venice venice)  
   - Action: Assign Day 10 = Venice (stay).  
   - Description/timing: Remain in Venice for Day 10.

10) (assign-next day10 day11 venice venice)  
    - Action: Assign Day 11 = Venice (stay).  
    - Description/timing: Remain in Venice for Day 11.

Final day-by-day assignment (result of the above actions):
- Day 1: Reykjavik
- Day 2: Reykjavik
- Day 3: Vienna
- Day 4: Vienna
- Day 5: Vienna
- Day 6: Vienna
- Day 7: Vienna
- Day 8: Venice
- Day 9: Venice
- Day 10: Venice
- Day 11: Venice

Per-city totals:
- Reykjavik: 2 days (Days 1–2)
- Vienna: 5 days (Days 3–7)
- Venice: 4 days (Days 8–11)

Notes / compliance:
- Total = 11 days.  
- All inter-city transitions use direct flights (Reykjavik↔Vienna, Vienna↔Venice); stays are allowed via self-connections.  
- The wedding constraint is satisfied: the traveler is in Venice on Days 8–11 (at least one day between Day 8 and Day 11).  
- This sequence exactly matches the provided PDDL plan actions (10 assign-next steps).
