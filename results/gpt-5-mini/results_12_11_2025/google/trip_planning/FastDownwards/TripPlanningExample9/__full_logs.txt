Target FastDownward by using classical planning with :typing and :numeric-fluents. Represent days as a numeric fluent (days-remaining) initialized to 15. Represent per-city needs as numeric fluents (need-riga, need-manchester, need-split) initialized from the audit. Provide actions: fly(x,y) with preconditions at(x) and direct(x,y) and effects move the agent to y; stay(c) with preconditions at(c), (> days-remaining 0), (> need-c 0) and effects decrement both days-remaining and the relevant need by 1.

Provide actions: fly(x,y) with preconditions at(x) and direct(x,y) and effects move the agent to y; stay(c) with preconditions at(c), (> days-remaining 0), (> need-c 0) and effects decrement both days-remaining and the relevant need by 1. The goal is (= days-remaining 0) and all needs equal 0. Do not use ad hoc quota tokens or post-hoc penalties. Always enclose the PDDL domain between <domain></domain> and the PDDL problem between <problem></problem> tags.",

NATURAL-PLAN sas_plan_10
------------------------------
Initial state (given): Day 1 — at Riga (Riga occupied on day 1).

Plan steps (each action from the PDDL plan, in order). For every "stay" the action consumes/occupies the successor day; for every "fly" the action departs on the end of one day and arrives to occupy the successor day.

1) (stay riga d1 d2)  
   - Action: Stay in Riga.  
   - Effect/timestamp: Occupy Day 2 in Riga (1 full day: Day 2).

2) (stay riga d2 d3)  
   - Action: Stay in Riga.  
   - Effect/timestamp: Occupy Day 3 in Riga (1 full day: Day 3).

3) (stay riga d3 d4)  
   - Action: Stay in Riga.  
   - Effect/timestamp: Occupy Day 4 in Riga (1 full day: Day 4).

4) (stay riga d4 d5)  
   - Action: Stay in Riga.  
   - Effect/timestamp: Occupy Day 5 in Riga (1 full day: Day 5).

5) (fly riga manchester d5 d6)  
   - Action: Fly from Riga to Manchester.  
   - Effect/timestamp: Depart at the end of Day 5 and arrive to occupy Day 6 in Manchester (arrival/occupancy: Day 6).

6) (stay manchester d6 d7)  
   - Action: Stay in Manchester.  
   - Effect/timestamp: Occupy Day 7 in Manchester (1 full day: Day 7).

7) (stay manchester d7 d8)  
   - Action: Stay in Manchester.  
   - Effect/timestamp: Occupy Day 8 in Manchester (1 full day: Day 8).

8) (stay manchester d8 d9)  
   - Action: Stay in Manchester.  
   - Effect/timestamp: Occupy Day 9 in Manchester (1 full day: Day 9).

9) (fly manchester split d9 d10)  
   - Action: Fly from Manchester to Split.  
   - Effect/timestamp: Depart at the end of Day 9 and arrive to occupy Day 10 in Split (arrival/occupancy: Day 10).

10) (stay split d10 d11)  
    - Action: Stay in Split.  
    - Effect/timestamp: Occupy Day 11 in Split (1 full day: Day 11).

11) (stay split d11 d12)  
    - Action: Stay in Split.  
    - Effect/timestamp: Occupy Day 12 in Split (1 full day: Day 12).

12) (stay split d12 d13)  
    - Action: Stay in Split.  
    - Effect/timestamp: Occupy Day 13 in Split (1 full day: Day 13).

13) (stay split d13 d14)  
    - Action: Stay in Split.  
    - Effect/timestamp: Occupy Day 14 in Split (1 full day: Day 14).

14) (stay split d14 d15)  
    - Action: Stay in Split.  
    - Effect/timestamp: Occupy Day 15 in Split (1 full day: Day 15).

Final status (after executing the above actions):
- Days occupied by city:
  - Riga: Days 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 → 5 days total
  - Manchester: Days 6, 7, 8, 9 → 4 days total
  - Split: Days 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15 → 6 days total
- Total days consumed: 15 (Days 1–15).
- All moves use only direct flights (Riga↔Manchester and Manchester→Split) and each city is visited exactly once, matching the specified/verified itinerary.

To minimally relax preferences while preserving all hard constraints (total length = 11, only direct flights used, and being in Venice at least one day in days 8..11 for the wedding), I reduced Vienna from 7 to 5 days (a 2-day reduction). The resulting plan (Reykjavik days 1\u20132 \u2192 Vienna days 3\u20137 \u2192 Venice days 8\u201311) uses only the direct flight edges Reykjavik\u2194Vienna and Vienna\u2194Venice and places the traveler in Venice during days 8\u201311 (wedding window satisfied)."

To minimally relax preferences while preserving all hard constraints (total length = 11, only direct flights used, and being in Venice at least one day in days 8..11 for the wedding), I reduced Vienna from 7 to 5 days (a 2-day reduction). The resulting plan (Reykjavik days 1\u20132 \u2192 Vienna days 3\u20137 \u2192 Venice days 8\u201311) uses only the direct flight edges Reykjavik\u2194Vienna and Vienna\u2194Venice and places the traveler in Venice during days 8\u201311 (wedding window satisfied)."

To minimally relax preferences while preserving all hard constraints (total length = 11, only direct flights used, and being in Venice at least one day in days 8..11 for the wedding), I reduced Vienna from 7 to 5 days (a 2-day reduction). The resulting plan (Reykjavik days 1\u20132 \u2192 Vienna days 3\u20137 \u2192 Venice days 8\u201311) uses only the direct flight edges Reykjavik\u2194Vienna and Vienna\u2194Venice and places the traveler in Venice during days 8\u201311 (wedding window satisfied)."

To minimally relax preferences while preserving all hard constraints (total length = 11, only direct flights used, and being in Venice at least one day in days 8..11 for the wedding), I reduced Vienna from 7 to 5 days (a 2-day reduction). The resulting plan (Reykjavik days 1\u20132 \u2192 Vienna days 3\u20137 \u2192 Venice days 8\u201311) uses only the direct flight edges Reykjavik\u2194Vienna and Vienna\u2194Venice and places the traveler in Venice during days 8\u201311 (wedding window satisfied)."

================================================================================


NATURAL-PLAN sas_plan_4
------------------------------
Initial state: Day 1 = Reykjavik.

Plan steps (each action corresponds exactly to one assign-next step in the PDDL plan). Each step assigns the city for the successor day; when a city changes it is executed as a direct flight on the morning of the successor day. Each step occupies one full day (the successor day).

1) (assign-next day1 day2 reykjavik reykjavik)  
   - Action: Assign Day 2 = Reykjavik (stay).  
   - Description/timing: Remain in Reykjavik for Day 2 (no flight).

2) (assign-next day2 day3 reykjavik vienna)  
   - Action: Assign Day 3 = Vienna.  
   - Description/timing: On the morning between Day 2 and Day 3 take a direct flight Reykjavik → Vienna; spend Day 3 in Vienna.

3) (assign-next day3 day4 vienna vienna)  
   - Action: Assign Day 4 = Vienna (stay).  
   - Description/timing: Remain in Vienna for Day 4.

4) (assign-next day4 day5 vienna vienna)  
   - Action: Assign Day 5 = Vienna (stay).  
   - Description/timing: Remain in Vienna for Day 5.

5) (assign-next day5 day6 vienna vienna)  
   - Action: Assign Day 6 = Vienna (stay).  
   - Description/timing: Remain in Vienna for Day 6.

6) (assign-next day6 day7 vienna vienna)  
   - Action: Assign Day 7 = Vienna (stay).  
   - Description/timing: Remain in Vienna for Day 7.

7) (assign-next day7 day8 vienna venice)  
   - Action: Assign Day 8 = Venice.  
   - Description/timing: On the morning between Day 7 and Day 8 take a direct flight Vienna → Venice; spend Day 8 in Venice.

8) (assign-next day8 day9 venice venice)  
   - Action: Assign Day 9 = Venice (stay).  
   - Description/timing: Remain in Venice for Day 9.

9) (assign-next day9 day10 venice venice)  
   - Action: Assign Day 10 = Venice (stay).  
   - Description/timing: Remain in Venice for Day 10.

10) (assign-next day10 day11 venice venice)  
    - Action: Assign Day 11 = Venice (stay).  
    - Description/timing: Remain in Venice for Day 11.

Final day-by-day assignment (result of the above actions):
- Day 1: Reykjavik
- Day 2: Reykjavik
- Day 3: Vienna
- Day 4: Vienna
- Day 5: Vienna
- Day 6: Vienna
- Day 7: Vienna
- Day 8: Venice
- Day 9: Venice
- Day 10: Venice
- Day 11: Venice

Per-city totals:
- Reykjavik: 2 days (Days 1–2)
- Vienna: 5 days (Days 3–7)
- Venice: 4 days (Days 8–11)

Notes / compliance:
- Total = 11 days.  
- All inter-city transitions use direct flights (Reykjavik↔Vienna, Vienna↔Venice); stays are allowed via self-connections.  
- The wedding constraint is satisfied: the traveler is in Venice on Days 8–11 (at least one day between Day 8 and Day 11).  
- This sequence exactly matches the provided PDDL plan actions (10 assign-next steps).

Modeling guidelines: 1) Types: city, day. 2) Predicates: (cur ?d - day), (next ?d ?d - day), (at ?c - city), (booked ?d - day ?c - city), (direct ?c1 - city ?c2 - city). 3) Actions: stay (book the current day at the current city and advance to the next day), fly (book the current day at the current city and move to a direct-flight neighbor as the new current city, then advance day), finalize-last-day (book day d6 without advancing). 4) Initial state: cur d1, at berlin unless the audited plan states a different day-1 city, next links d1->d2->d3->d4->d5->d6, direct edges according to the flight graph (both directions). 5) Hard goals: every day d1..d6 is booked to exactly one city; booked d5 bucharest and booked d6 bucharest. 6) Use action costs with total-cost and a metric minimize total-cost; assign cost 1 to each action. 7) Ensure the problem objects include all cities and days, and the goal conjunctively requires that all six days are booked and the Bucharest days are enforced. Output format: provide <domain>...</domain> followed by <problem>...</problem> only."

NATURAL-PLAN sas_plan_10
------------------------------
1) Day d1 — stay in Berlin (action: stay d1 d2 berlin)
   - Occupy the whole day in Berlin and book day d1 as Berlin.
   - No flight on this day. Advance current day to d2.

2) Day d2 — fly Berlin → Warsaw (action: fly d2 d3 berlin warsaw)
   - Book day d2 as Berlin, then take a direct flight from Berlin to Warsaw on day d2 (same-day direct flight).
   - Arrive in Warsaw and advance current day to d3.

3) Day d3 — stay in Warsaw (action: stay d3 d4 warsaw)
   - Occupy the whole day in Warsaw and book day d3 as Warsaw.
   - No flight on this day. Advance current day to d4.

4) Day d4 — fly Warsaw → Bucharest (action: fly d4 d5 warsaw bucharest)
   - Book day d4 as Warsaw, then take a direct flight from Warsaw to Bucharest on day d4 (same-day direct flight).
   - Arrive in Bucharest and advance current day to d5.

5) Day d5 — stay in Bucharest (action: stay d5 d6 bucharest)
   - Occupy the whole day in Bucharest and book day d5 as Bucharest.
   - No flight on this day. Advance current day to d6.

6) Day d6 — finalize last day in Bucharest (action: finalize-last-day d6 bucharest)
   - Book day d6 as Bucharest and finalize the itinerary (no further day advancement).

Summary:
- Day-by-day cities: d1: Berlin; d2: Berlin; d3: Warsaw; d4: Warsaw; d5: Bucharest; d6: Bucharest.
- Flight legs taken: Berlin → Warsaw (on d2), Warsaw → Bucharest (on d4). Both are direct flights per the validated graph.
- All hard constraints satisfied: exactly one city booked per day for 6 days; Bucharest on d5 and d6.
- Plan actions: 6 actions (cost = 6).

NATURAL-PLAN sas_plan_2
------------------------------
Initial state: Day 1 — in Berlin.

Planned steps (one per action in the provided plan):

1) Stay (day1 → day2) — Remain in Berlin.  
   - Time: throughout Day 1, arriving at Day 2 in Berlin.  
   - Result: at Day 2 = Berlin.

2) Stay (day2 → day3) — Remain in Berlin.  
   - Time: throughout Day 2, arriving at Day 3 in Berlin.  
   - Result: at Day 3 = Berlin.

3) Stay (day3 → day4) — Remain in Berlin.  
   - Time: throughout Day 3, arriving at Day 4 in Berlin.  
   - Result: at Day 4 = Berlin. (Conference day — hard requirement satisfied.)

4) Fly (day4 → day5) — Direct flight from Berlin to Munich.  
   - Time: flight taken between Day 4 and Day 5, arriving on Day 5 in Munich.  
   - Result: at Day 5 = Munich.

5) Fly (day5 → day6) — Direct flight from Munich to Dubrovnik.  
   - Time: flight taken between Day 5 and Day 6, arriving on Day 6 in Dubrovnik.  
   - Result: at Day 6 = Dubrovnik.

6) Stay (day6 → day7) — Remain in Dubrovnik.  
   - Time: throughout Day 6, arriving at Day 7 in Dubrovnik.  
   - Result: at Day 7 = Dubrovnik.

7) Stay (day7 → day8) — Remain in Dubrovnik.  
   - Time: throughout Day 7, arriving at Day 8 in Dubrovnik.  
   - Result: at Day 8 = Dubrovnik.

Summary / verification:
- Sequence enforces: Berlin days 1–4 (contiguous), Munich day 5, Dubrovnik days 6–8 (contiguous).  
- Flights taken (direct only): Day4→Day5 Berlin→Munich; Day5→Day6 Munich→Dubrovnik.  
- Total flights: 2. Total actions: 7. Reported plan cost: 7 (unit cost).  
- All actions respect the one-move-per-day constraint and the direct-flight connectivity.

PROBLEM
------------------------------
You plan to visit 3 European cities for 11 days in total. You only take direct flights to commute between cities. You plan to stay in Venice for 6 days. You would like to visit Dubrovnik for 4 days. You would like to visit Istanbul for 3 days.

Here are the cities that have direct flights:
from Dubrovnik to Istanbul, Istanbul and Venice.

Find a trip plan of visiting the cities for 11 days by taking direct flights to commute between them.
================================================================================


ENVIRONMENT
------------------------------
You plan to visit 3 European cities for 11 days in total. You only take direct flights to commute between cities. You plan to stay in Venice for 6 days. You would like to visit Dubrovnik for 4 days. You would like to visit Istanbul for 3 days.

Here are the cities that have direct flights:
from Dubrovnik to Istanbul, Istanbul and Venice.

Find a trip plan of visiting the cities for 11 days by taking direct flights to commute between them.
================================================================================


FINAL-PLAN
------------------------------
I don’t have the flight graph, the trip preferences, or the auditor’s recommendation in your last message — those are required to generate a correct, solver-ready PDDL domain and problem that respect the auditor’s feasible alternative. Please provide the following concrete details so I can produce the PDDL exactly as required:

1. The set of cities (names).
2. The directed flight edges (list of ordered pairs e.g., A -> B), only these edges may be used.
3. The start city (where the traveler is on day1).
4. The auditor’s recommendation (if the original goal is infeasible): the exact sequence of cities the auditor requires visiting and the number of days to allocate to each city (these must sum to exactly 11 days). If the auditor gave a sequence but not day counts, please supply day counts per city (or confirm you want me to distribute days equally where feasible).
5. Any hard constraints/preferences that must be encoded as strict constraints (examples you might have stated earlier): forbidden cities, earliest/latest arrival day constraints for specific cities, required ordering beyond the auditor’s sequence, whether flights can only occur at day boundaries (I will assume flights occur instantaneously between days and that each day you are located in exactly one city).
6. Whether multiple flights per day are allowed (I will default to one transition per day: either stay or fly to the next day’s city).
7. If there are multiple agents, please confirm number and starting cities for each agent and whether agents interact. (If single traveler, say so.)

If you want me to proceed with a consistent example (I can produce a fully valid PDDL instance that follows all modeling rules you gave), tell me to “use a concrete example” and I will generate PDDL with an example flight graph and an auditor-recommended itinerary summing to 11 days. Otherwise please supply the items 1–4 (minimum) and any additional hard constraints, and I will produce the domain and problem PDDL enclosed in <domain>...</domain> and <problem>...</problem>.

Encode hard requirements: exactly 3 days in Frankfurt, exactly 3 in Bucharest, the remaining days in Stuttgart to meet the 10-day horizon as reconciled by the auditor, and attending the workshop by having at least one Stuttgart day within the window (day5..day10). You may use numeric fluents or compiled counters to enforce exact day counts per city. Actions should assign each day in order and allow either staying in the same city or moving along a direct flight edge; illegal jumps must be impossible. The problem must instantiate objects for all days and cities, define the direct-flight adjacency, define the workshop window days, and set the goal to have all days assigned consistently with counts satisfied and the workshop attended.

Encode hard requirements: exactly 3 days in Frankfurt, exactly 3 in Bucharest, the remaining days in Stuttgart to meet the 10-day horizon as reconciled by the auditor, and attending the workshop by having at least one Stuttgart day within the window (day5..day10). You may use numeric fluents or compiled counters to enforce exact day counts per city. Actions should assign each day in order and allow either staying in the same city or moving along a direct flight edge; illegal jumps must be impossible.

NATURAL-PLAN sas_plan_9
------------------------------
Step 1 — place-bucharest-start (day1 day2 day3 day4)
- Action: Place a 3-day contiguous block in Bucharest starting at day1.
- Assignment: day1 = Bucharest, day2 = Bucharest, day3 = Bucharest.
- Duration / timestamps: Days 1–3 (3 days).
- Notes: This is the initial placement; the next day to assign after this block is day4.

Step 2 — place-frankfurt-after (day3 day4 day5 day6 day7 bucharest)
- Action: Place a 3-day contiguous block in Frankfurt immediately after the Bucharest block.
- Assignment: day4 = Frankfurt, day5 = Frankfurt, day6 = Frankfurt.
- Duration / timestamps: Days 4–6 (3 days).
- Transition: A direct flight is taken between day3 and day4 from Bucharest → Frankfurt (required and available).
- Notes: After this block the next day to assign is day7.

Step 3 — place-stuttgart-after (day6 day7 day8 day9 day10 day11 frankfurt)
- Action: Place a 4-day contiguous block in Stuttgart immediately after the Frankfurt block.
- Assignment: day7 = Stuttgart, day8 = Stuttgart, day9 = Stuttgart, day10 = Stuttgart.
- Duration / timestamps: Days 7–10 (4 days).
- Transition: A direct flight is taken between day6 and day7 from Frankfurt → Stuttgart (required and available).
- Notes: The sentinel day11 is used as the pointer beyond the final assigned day.

Final check (compliance with specification)
- Total horizon: 10 days (day1..day10) — fully assigned.
- City counts: Bucharest = 3 days, Frankfurt = 3 days, Stuttgart = 4 days — matches the goal.
- Workshop window: At least one Stuttgart day falls in day5..day10 (Stuttgart occupies days 7–10) — requirement satisfied.
- All inter-day moves obey direct-flight edges (Bucharest↔Frankfurt and Frankfurt↔Stuttgart).
