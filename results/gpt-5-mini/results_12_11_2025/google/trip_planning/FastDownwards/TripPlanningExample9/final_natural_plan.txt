Step 1 — place-bucharest-start (day1 day2 day3 day4)
- Action: Place a 3-day contiguous block in Bucharest starting at day1.
- Assignment: day1 = Bucharest, day2 = Bucharest, day3 = Bucharest.
- Duration / timestamps: Days 1–3 (3 days).
- Notes: This is the initial placement; the next day to assign after this block is day4.

Step 2 — place-frankfurt-after (day3 day4 day5 day6 day7 bucharest)
- Action: Place a 3-day contiguous block in Frankfurt immediately after the Bucharest block.
- Assignment: day4 = Frankfurt, day5 = Frankfurt, day6 = Frankfurt.
- Duration / timestamps: Days 4–6 (3 days).
- Transition: A direct flight is taken between day3 and day4 from Bucharest → Frankfurt (required and available).
- Notes: After this block the next day to assign is day7.

Step 3 — place-stuttgart-after (day6 day7 day8 day9 day10 day11 frankfurt)
- Action: Place a 4-day contiguous block in Stuttgart immediately after the Frankfurt block.
- Assignment: day7 = Stuttgart, day8 = Stuttgart, day9 = Stuttgart, day10 = Stuttgart.
- Duration / timestamps: Days 7–10 (4 days).
- Transition: A direct flight is taken between day6 and day7 from Frankfurt → Stuttgart (required and available).
- Notes: The sentinel day11 is used as the pointer beyond the final assigned day.

Final check (compliance with specification)
- Total horizon: 10 days (day1..day10) — fully assigned.
- City counts: Bucharest = 3 days, Frankfurt = 3 days, Stuttgart = 4 days — matches the goal.
- Workshop window: At least one Stuttgart day falls in day5..day10 (Stuttgart occupies days 7–10) — requirement satisfied.
- All inter-day moves obey direct-flight edges (Bucharest↔Frankfurt and Frankfurt↔Stuttgart).
