PROBLEM
------------------------------
I am playing with a set of objects. Here are the actions I can do

Paltry object_0 object_1 object_2.

I have the following restrictions on my actions:
To perform paltry action, the following facts need to be true: hand object_0, cats object_1, texture object_2, vase object_0 object_1, and next object_1 object_2
Once paltry is performed the following facts will be true: next object_0 object_2

To perform wretched action, the following facts need to be true: sneeze object_0, texture object_1, texture object_2, stupendous object_3, next object_0 object_1, collect object_1 object_3, and collect object_2 object_3
Once wretched is performed the following facts will be true: next object_0 object_2

Once memory is performed the following facts will be true: next object_0 object_2
Once memory is performed the following facts will be false: next object_0 object_1
To perform tightfisted action, the following facts need to be true: hand object_0, sneeze object_1, texture object_2, next object_1 object_2, and vase object_0 object_1
Once tightfisted is performed the following facts will be true: next object_0 object_2

NATURAL-PLAN sas_plan_1
------------------------------
Goal: make next(object_8, object_6) true.

- Step 1 (t=0.0–1.0, duration 1): memory object_1 object_6 object_7
  - Preconditions (hold): cats object_1; spring object_6; spring object_7; next object_1 object_6.
  - Effects: add next object_1 object_7; delete next object_1 object_6.

- Step 2 (t=1.0–2.0, duration 1): sip object_8 object_1 object_7
  - Preconditions (hold): hand object_8; cats object_1; texture object_7; next object_8 object_7; next object_1 object_7.
  - Effects: add vase object_8 object_1; delete next object_8 object_7.

- Step 3 (t=2.0–3.0, duration 1): memory object_1 object_7 object_6
  - Preconditions (hold): cats object_1; spring object_7; spring object_6; next object_1 object_7.
  - Effects: add next object_1 object_6; delete next object_1 object_7.

- Step 4 (t=3.0–4.0, duration 1): paltry object_8 object_1 object_6
  - Preconditions (hold): hand object_8; cats object_1; texture object_6; vase object_8 object_1; next object_1 object_6.
  - Effects: add next object_8 object_6; delete vase object_8 object_1.

Result: next object_8 object_6 is achieved at t=4.0.

PROBLEM
------------------------------
I am playing with a set of objects. Here are the actions I can do

Paltry object_0 object_1 object_2.
Sip object_0 object_1 object_2.
Clip object_0 object_1 object_2.
Wretched object_0 object_1 object_2 object_3.
Memory object_0 object_1 object_2.
Tightfisted object_0 object_1 object_2.

I have the following restrictions on my actions:
To perform paltry action, the following facts need to be true: hand object_0, cats object_1, texture object_2, vase object_0 object_1, and next object_1 object_2
Once paltry is performed the following facts will be true: next object_0 object_2
Once paltry is performed the following facts will be false: vase object_0 object_1
To perform sip action, the following facts need to be true: hand object_0, cats object_1, texture object_2, next object_0 object_2, and next object_1 object_2
Once sip is performed the following facts will be true: vase object_0 object_1
Once sip is performed the following facts will be false: next object_0 object_2
To perform clip action, the following facts need to be true: hand object_0, sneeze object_1, texture object_2, next object_1 object_2, and next object_0 object_2
Once clip is performed the following facts will be true: vase object_0 object_1
Once clip is performed the following facts will be false: next object_0 object_2
To perform wretched action, the following facts need to be true: sneeze object_0, texture object_1, texture object_2, stupendous object_3, next object_0 object_1, collect object_1 object_3, and collect object_2 object_3
Once wretched is performed the following facts will be true: next object_0 object_2
Once wretched is performed the following facts will be false: next object_0 object_1
To perform memory action, the following facts need to be true: cats object_0, spring object_1, spring object_2, and next object_0 object_1
Once memory is performed the following facts will be true: next object_0 object_2
Once memory is performed the following facts will be false: next object_0 object_1
To perform tightfisted action, the following facts need to be true: hand object_0, sneeze object_1, texture object_2, next object_1 object_2, and vase object_0 object_1
Once tightfisted is performed the following facts will be true: next object_0 object_2
Once tightfisted is performed the following facts will be false: vase object_0 object_1

NATURAL-PLAN sas_plan_1
------------------------------
Here is the human-readable execution of the plan (unit-duration steps, 1 time unit each):

1) t=0–1: memory(object_0, object_6, object_5)
   - Preconditions: cats(object_0), spring(object_6), spring(object_5), next(object_0, object_6)
   - Effect: add next(object_0, object_5); remove next(object_0, object_6)

2) t=1–2: sip(object_8, object_0, object_5)
   - Preconditions: hand(object_8), cats(object_0), texture(object_5), next(object_8, object_5), next(object_0, object_5)
   - Effect: add vase(object_8, object_0); remove next(object_8, object_5)

3) t=2–3: memory(object_0, object_5, object_6)
   - Preconditions: cats(object_0), spring(object_5), spring(object_6), next(object_0, object_5)
   - Effect: add next(object_0, object_6); remove next(object_0, object_5)

4) t=3–4: paltry(object_8, object_0, object_6)
   - Preconditions: hand(object_8), cats(object_0), texture(object_6), vase(object_8, object_0), next(object_0, object_6)
   - Effect: add next(object_8, object_6); remove vase(object_8, object_0)

Goal satisfied at t=4:
- next(object_7, object_6) remains true from the start, and
- next(object_8, object_6) is established in Step 4.
