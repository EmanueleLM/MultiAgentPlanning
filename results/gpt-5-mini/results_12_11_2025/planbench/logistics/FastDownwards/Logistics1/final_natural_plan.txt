Here is the human-readable execution of the plan (unit-duration steps, 1 time unit each):

1) t=0–1: memory(object_0, object_6, object_5)
   - Preconditions: cats(object_0), spring(object_6), spring(object_5), next(object_0, object_6)
   - Effect: add next(object_0, object_5); remove next(object_0, object_6)

2) t=1–2: sip(object_8, object_0, object_5)
   - Preconditions: hand(object_8), cats(object_0), texture(object_5), next(object_8, object_5), next(object_0, object_5)
   - Effect: add vase(object_8, object_0); remove next(object_8, object_5)

3) t=2–3: memory(object_0, object_5, object_6)
   - Preconditions: cats(object_0), spring(object_5), spring(object_6), next(object_0, object_5)
   - Effect: add next(object_0, object_6); remove next(object_0, object_5)

4) t=3–4: paltry(object_8, object_0, object_6)
   - Preconditions: hand(object_8), cats(object_0), texture(object_6), vase(object_8, object_0), next(object_0, object_6)
   - Effect: add next(object_8, object_6); remove vase(object_8, object_0)

Goal satisfied at t=4:
- next(object_7, object_6) remains true from the start, and
- next(object_8, object_6) is established in Step 4.
