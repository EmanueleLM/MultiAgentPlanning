Human-readable execution plan (each step starts at the given timestamp and takes duration 1)

- t=0, dur=1: Execute sip with parameters (object_8, object_0, object_6).
  Effect: creates vase(object_8, object_0); removes next(object_8, object_6).

- t=1, dur=1: Execute sip with parameters (object_7, object_0, object_6).
  Effect: creates vase(object_7, object_0); removes next(object_7, object_6).

- t=2, dur=1: Execute memory with parameters (object_0, object_6, object_5).
  Effect: adds next(object_0, object_5); removes next(object_0, object_6).

- t=3, dur=1: Execute paltry with parameters (object_8, object_0, object_5).
  Effect: adds next(object_8, object_5); removes vase(object_8, object_0).

- t=4, dur=1: Execute paltry with parameters (object_7, object_0, object_5).
  Effect: adds next(object_7, object_5); removes vase(object_7, object_0).

Outcome: Goal achieved — next(object_7, object_5) and next(object_8, object_5) both hold.
