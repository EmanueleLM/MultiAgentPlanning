Here is the human-readable execution of the plan that achieves the goal:

1) t=0, duration=1: (sip object_8 object_0 object_6)
   Effects: add (vase object_8 object_0); del (next object_8 object_6)

2) t=1, duration=1: (sip object_7 object_0 object_6)
   Effects: add (vase object_7 object_0); del (next object_7 object_6)

3) t=2, duration=1: (memory object_0 object_6 object_5)
   Effects: add (next object_0 object_5); del (next object_0 object_6)

4) t=3, duration=1: (paltry object_8 object_0 object_5)
   Effects: add (next object_8 object_5); del (vase object_8 object_0)

5) t=4, duration=1: (paltry object_7 object_0 object_5)
   Effects: add (next object_7 object_5); del (vase object_7 object_0)

Final goal reached: (next object_7 object_5) and (next object_8 object_5).
Total actions: 5; total time (assuming unit durations): 5.
