Human-readable execution plan (assume each action takes 1 time unit)

- Step 1 (t=0 → t=1): clip(object_9, object_4, object_7)
  Description: With hand(object_9), sneeze(object_4), texture(object_7), next(object_4, object_7), and next(object_9, object_7) true, create vase(object_9, object_4) and remove next(object_9, object_7).

- Step 2 (t=1 → t=2): wretched(object_4, object_7, object_8, object_2)
  Description: Using sneeze(object_4), texture(object_7), texture(object_8), stupendous(object_2), next(object_4, object_7), collect(object_7, object_2), and collect(object_8, object_2), change linkage to add next(object_4, object_8) and remove next(object_4, object_7).

- Step 3 (t=2 → t=3): tightfisted(object_9, object_4, object_8)
  Description: With hand(object_9), sneeze(object_4), texture(object_8), next(object_4, object_8), and vase(object_9, object_4), establish next(object_9, object_8) and remove vase(object_9, object_4). Goal achieved: next(object_9, object_8).
