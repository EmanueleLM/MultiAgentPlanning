Below is a clear, human-readable rendering of the supplied plan. Each step is reported in the same order as the plan and includes: the action name, the exact parameters (object identifiers), the time progression (stage/timestamp), the preconditions that are checked at that time, and the effects produced (what is added and what is deleted). Each action advances the discrete stage by one (treated here as one time unit).

Step 1 — Action: sip(object_8, object_0, object_7)
- Time: stage_0 → stage_1 (t = 0 to t = 1; duration = 1 time unit)
- Parameters:
  - o0 = object_8
  - o1 = object_0
  - o2 = object_7
- Preconditions verified at stage_0:
  - hand(object_8)
  - cats(object_0)
  - texture(object_7)
  - next(object_8, object_7)
  - next(object_0, object_7)
- Effects (applied at stage_1):
  - Add: vase(object_8, object_0)
  - Delete: next(object_8, object_7)
- Notes: All preconditions are present in the initial state at stage_0, so the action executes and produces the vase relation while consuming the next(object_8,object_7) token.

Step 2 — Action: memory(object_0, object_7, object_6)
- Time: stage_1 → stage_2 (t = 1 to t = 2; duration = 1 time unit)
- Parameters:
  - o0 = object_0
  - o1 = object_7
  - o2 = object_6
- Preconditions verified at stage_1:
  - cats(object_0)
  - spring(object_7)
  - spring(object_6)
  - next(object_0, object_7)
    (note: next(object_0, object_7) remained true after Step 1)
- Effects (applied at stage_2):
  - Add: next(object_0, object_6)
  - Delete: next(object_0, object_7)
- Notes: This step re-targets object_0’s next pointer from object_7 to object_6, producing next(object_0,object_6) needed by the final step.

Step 3 — Action: paltry(object_8, object_0, object_6)
- Time: stage_2 → stage_3 (t = 2 to t = 3; duration = 1 time unit)
- Parameters:
  - o0 = object_8
  - o1 = object_0
  - o2 = object_6
- Preconditions verified at stage_2:
  - hand(object_8)
  - cats(object_0)
  - texture(object_6)
  - vase(object_8, object_0)      (created by Step 1)
  - next(object_0, object_6)     (created by Step 2)
- Effects (applied at stage_3):
  - Add: next(object_8, object_6)
  - Delete: vase(object_8, object_0)
- Notes: All preconditions hold at stage_2, so this step succeeds and produces the goal predicate.

Final state / Goal achievement:
- After Step 3 (at stage_3), the goal predicate next(object_8, object_6) is true.
- The plan consists exactly of the three actions above and reaches the specified goal in 3 steps / 3 time units.
