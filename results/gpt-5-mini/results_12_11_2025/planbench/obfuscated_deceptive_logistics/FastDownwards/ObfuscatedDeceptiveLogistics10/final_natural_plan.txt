Below is a concise, human-readable trace of the given plan. Each step lists the action, its object parameters, the start→end timestamp, required preconditions (stating whether they are satisfied at that time), the action effects (what is added and what is deleted), and a one-line plain-English description.

1) Step 1 — clip object_10 object_4 object_6  (t0 → t1)
   - Preconditions (required at t0):
     - (hand object_10) — satisfied (given in init)
     - (sneeze object_4) — satisfied (given in init)
     - (texture object_6) — satisfied (given in init)
     - (next object_4 object_6) — satisfied (given in init)
     - (next object_10 object_6) — satisfied (given in init)
     - (last-time t0) and (succ t0 t1) — satisfied (time chain in init)
   - Effects (applied at t1):
     - ADD: (vase object_10 object_4)
     - DELETE: (next object_10 object_6)
     - last-time updated from t0 to t1
   - Description: Using object_10 and object_4 with context object_6, create vase(object_10,object_4) and remove the link next(object_10,object_6). (Time advances t0→t1.)

2) Step 2 — wretched object_4 object_6 object_7 object_2  (t1 → t2)
   - Preconditions (required at t1):
     - (sneeze object_4) — satisfied (init)
     - (texture object_6) — satisfied (init)
     - (texture object_7) — satisfied (init)
     - (stupendous object_2) — satisfied (init)
     - (next object_4 object_6) — satisfied (still present at t1)
     - (collect object_6 object_2) — satisfied (init)
     - (collect object_7 object_2) — satisfied (init)
     - (last-time t1) and (succ t1 t2) — satisfied (from previous step/time chain)
   - Effects (applied at t2):
     - ADD: (next object_4 object_7)
     - DELETE: (next object_4 object_6)
     - last-time updated from t1 to t2
   - Description: Reroute object_4’s successor from object_6 to object_7 (produces next(object_4,object_7) and removes next(object_4,object_6)). (Time t1→t2.)

3) Step 3 — tightfisted object_10 object_4 object_7  (t2 → t3)
   - Preconditions (required at t2):
     - (hand object_10) — satisfied (init)
     - (sneeze object_4) — satisfied (init)
     - (texture object_7) — satisfied (init)
     - (next object_4 object_7) — satisfied (created in Step 2)
     - (vase object_10 object_4) — satisfied (created in Step 1)
     - (last-time t2) and (succ t2 t3) — satisfied
   - Effects (applied at t3):
     - ADD: (next object_10 object_7)
     - DELETE: (vase object_10 object_4)
     - last-time updated from t2 to t3
   - Description: Use the vase linking object_10→object_4 and the new link object_4→object_7 to create next(object_10,object_7) (goal fact for object_10). (Time t2→t3.)

4) Step 4 — wretched object_5 object_8 object_9 object_3  (t3 → t4)
   - Preconditions (required at t3):
     - (sneeze object_5) — satisfied (init)
     - (texture object_8) — satisfied (init)
     - (texture object_9) — satisfied (init)
     - (stupendous object_3) — satisfied (init)
     - (next object_5 object_8) — satisfied (init)
     - (collect object_8 object_3) — satisfied (init)
     - (collect object_9 object_3) — satisfied (init)
     - (last-time t3) and (succ t3 t4) — satisfied
   - Effects (applied at t4):
     - ADD: (next object_5 object_9)
     - DELETE: (next object_5 object_8)
     - last-time updated from t3 to t4
   - Description: Reroute object_5’s successor from object_8 to object_9 (produces next(object_5,object_9)). (Time t3→t4.)

5) Step 5 — clip object_11 object_5 object_9  (t4 → t5)
   - Preconditions (required at t4):
     - (hand object_11) — satisfied (init)
     - (sneeze object_5) — satisfied (init)
     - (texture object_9) — satisfied (init)
     - (next object_5 object_9) — satisfied (created in Step 4)
     - (next object_11 object_9) — satisfied (init)
     - (last-time t4) and (succ t4 t5) — satisfied
   - Effects (applied at t5):
     - ADD: (vase object_11 object_5)
     - DELETE: (next object_11 object_9)
     - last-time updated from t4 to t5
   - Description: Using object_11 and object_5 with context object_9, create vase(object_11,object_5) and remove next(object_11,object_9). (Time t4→t5.)

6) Step 6 — wretched object_5 object_9 object_8 object_3  (t5 → t6)
   - Preconditions (required at t5):
     - (sneeze object_5) — satisfied (init)
     - (texture object_9) — satisfied (init)
     - (texture object_8) — satisfied (init)
     - (stupendous object_3) — satisfied (init)
     - (next object_5 object_9) — satisfied (created in Step 4 and not deleted by Step 5)
     - (collect object_9 object_3) — satisfied (init)
     - (collect object_8 object_3) — satisfied (init)
     - (last-time t5) and (succ t5 t6) — satisfied
   - Effects (applied at t6):
     - ADD: (next object_5 object_8)
     - DELETE: (next object_5 object_9)
     - last-time updated from t5 to t6
   - Description: Reroute object_5’s successor back from object_9 to object_8 (produces next(object_5,object_8)). (Time t5→t6.)

7) Step 7 — tightfisted object_11 object_5 object_8  (t6 → t7)
   - Preconditions (required at t6):
     - (hand object_11) — satisfied (init)
     - (sneeze object_5) — satisfied (init)
     - (texture object_8) — satisfied (init)
     - (next object_5 object_8) — satisfied (created in Step 6)
     - (vase object_11 object_5) — satisfied (created in Step 5)
     - (last-time t6) and (succ t6 t7) — satisfied
   - Effects (applied at t7):
     - ADD: (next object_11 object_8)
     - DELETE: (vase object_11 object_5)
     - last-time updated from t6 to t7
   - Description: Use the vase linking object_11→object_5 and the link object_5→object_8 to create next(object_11,object_8) (goal fact for object_11). (Time t6→t7.)

Final status (after t7):
 - Goal facts achieved:
   - (next object_10 object_7) — created at t3 (Step 3)
   - (next object_11 object_8) — created at t7 (Step 7)
 - Plan cost: 7 actions (unit cost per step).

This sequence strictly follows the provided plan steps and timestamps, lists required preconditions and effects for each action, and shows that both goal predicates are produced by the trace.
