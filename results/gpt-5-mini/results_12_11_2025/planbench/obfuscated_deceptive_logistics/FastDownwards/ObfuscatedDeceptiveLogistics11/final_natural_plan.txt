Below is a clear, step-by-step human-readable trace of the provided plan. Each step corresponds exactly to one action in the given plan (no actions added or removed). I give a simple timestamp (start time in integer units) and a unit duration (1.0) for each step, the operator name, the concrete object arguments, the canonical parameter-to-type binding (from the domain), the preconditions used at that time (brief), and the concrete effects applied (adds and deletes). All predicates used are from the supplied specification: (texture ...), (vase ...), (next ...), (collect ...), (spring ...).

Final state relevant to the goal (after step 12)
- (next object_10 object_7) — established at Step 3 (tightfisted object_10 ...)
- (next object_11 object_7) — established at Step 12 (paltry object_11 ...)
- (next object_9 object_7)  — established at Step 11 (paltry object_9 ...)
- These three required goal facts are all present, so the plan achieves the goal.

Notes about timing/duration:
- I used unit durations for each action (duration = 1.0) and consecutive integer start times (0.0 to 12.0), matching the plan’s 13 unit-cost steps. The ordering is exactly as provided by the plan and is causally consistent with the preconditions/effects described in the domain.

If you want, I can:
- Produce a compact table mapping each plan step to the operator schema name and the exact predicates that justified the step, or
- Produce a timeline visualization showing when each predicate is created and deleted.
