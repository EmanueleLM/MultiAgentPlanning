PROBLEM
------------------------------
I am playing with a set of objects. Here are the actions I can do

Paltry object_0 object_1 object_2.

Clip object_0 object_1 object_2.
Wretched object_0 object_1 object_2 object_3.
Memory object_0 object_1 object_2.
Tightfisted object_0 object_1 object_2.

I have the following restrictions on my actions:
To perform paltry action, the following facts need to be true: hand object_0, cats object_1, texture object_2, vase object_0 object_1, and next object_1 object_2
Once paltry is performed the following facts will be true: next object_0 object_2
Once paltry is performed the following facts will be false: vase object_0 object_1
To perform sip action, the following facts need to be true: hand object_0, cats object_1, texture object_2, next object_0 object_2, and next object_1 object_2
Once sip is performed the following facts will be true: vase object_0 object_1
Once sip is performed the following facts will be false: next object_0 object_2

NATURAL-PLAN sas_plan_10
------------------------------
Plan (3 steps, discrete timestamps t0→t1→t2→t3; cost = 3):

Step 1 — (t0 → t1)
Action: sip object_8 object_0 object_7
- Parameters: ?o0=object_8, ?o1=object_0, ?o2=object_7
- Preconditions checked (all true at t0):
  - (hand object_8)            — present in init
  - (cats object_0)            — present in init
  - (texture object_7)         — present in init
  - (next object_8 object_7)   — present in init
  - (next object_0 object_7)   — present in init
  - (current s0)               — s0 is current at start
  - (succ s0 s1)               — available in init
- Effects applied at t1:
  - Added: (vase object_8 object_0)
  - Deleted: (next object_8 object_7)
  - Time-step: current becomes s1 (current s0 removed, current s1 added)
- Resulting relevant facts after step:
  - vase object_8 object_0 (new)
  - next object_8 object_7 (removed)
  - next object_0 object_7, next object_1 object_7, next object_4 object_6, next object_5 object_7 remain
  - current = s1

Step 2 — (t1 → t2)
Action: memory object_0 object_7 object_6
- Parameters: ?o0=object_0, ?o1=object_7, ?o2=object_6
- Preconditions checked (all true at t1):
  - (cats object_0)           — present in init
  - (spring object_7)         — present in init
  - (spring object_6)         — present in init
  - (next object_0 object_7)  — remained after step 1
  - (current s1)              — set by step 1
  - (succ s1 s2)              — available in init
- Effects applied at t2:
  - Added: (next object_0 object_6)
  - Deleted: (next object_0 object_7)
  - Time-step: current becomes s2 (current s1 removed, current s2 added)
- Resulting relevant facts after step:
  - next object_0 object_6 (new)
  - next object_0 object_7 (removed)
  - vase object_8 object_0 (still present)
  - other next relations remain as before
  - current = s2

Step 3 — (t2 → t3)
Action: paltry object_8 object_0 object_6
- Parameters: ?o0=object_8, ?o1=object_0, ?o2=object_6
- Preconditions checked (all true at t2):
  - (hand object_8)            — init
  - (cats object_0)            — init
  - (texture object_6)         — init
  - (vase object_8 object_0)   — created by step 1
  - (next object_0 object_6)   — created by step 2
  - (current s2)               — set by step 2
  - (succ s2 s3)               — available in init
- Effects applied at t3:
  - Added: (next object_8 object_6)   — GOAL achieved
  - Deleted: (vase object_8 object_0)
  - Time-step: current becomes s3 (current s2 removed, current s3 added)
- Final relevant facts after step:
  - next object_8 object_6 (present) — goal satisfied
  - vase object_8 object_0 (removed)
  - current = s3

Assumptions and notes
- All required initial facts used by each action were present when checked; no extra facts or bookkeeping were introduced beyond the action effects.
- Time is represented by the step variable progression (s0→s1→s2→s3). I used t0,t1,t2,t3 to indicate these discrete transitions.
- The plan exactly matches the provided sequence and achieves the goal (next object_8 object_6) at the end of step 3.

================================================================================


FINAL-PLAN
------------------------------
I don't yet have the structured summaries or the audit_report you referenced. I need those inputs to produce a correct, complete PDDL domain and problem. Please provide the audited inputs in one message (or point me to them). To make the PDDL exact and FastDownward-compatible, include the following concrete details:

1. Agents and types
   - List of agent names (e.g., robot1, operatorA) and any type hierarchy (e.g., agent, vehicle, human).
   - If multi-agent actions exist, indicate whether actions are symmetric or which agent must perform which action.

2. Actions / capabilities (for each action)
   - Canonical name and parameter list (with types).
   - Preconditions (facts required before action).
   - Effects (facts added and deleted).
   - If an action must be performed by a specific agent, state that.
   - If some actions must be atomic multi-agent (joint actions), indicate participants and the required simultaneous semantics.

3. Objects and locations
   - Full list of domain objects (locations, items, tools, slots, days/time-step objects).
   - For ordered phases or time slots (e.g., days, steps), provide the ordered list or successor relations; if contiguous intervals are required, say so.

4. Initial state (audited)
   - All grounded predicates that are true initially (e.g., at(robot1 locA), charged(robot1), tool-on-station).
   - Any false/forbidden facts that must be enforced initially (e.g., not-held(itemX)).

5. Goals (audited)
   - All required terminal facts (e.g., at(package target), assembled(partA)).
   - If goals require sequences or ordering, express which facts must hold at the end and any intermediate milestone constraints that must be achieved in order (we will encode ordering as explicit predicates if needed).

6. Hard constraints / preferences to treat as constraints
   - Any "avoid", "would rather", "earliest", "exactly", "at most" statements must be encoded as hard constraints. For each:
     - "Avoid X" -> specify which actions or states are forbidden.
     - "Earliest at time t" or "exactly k occurrences" -> specify whether this refers to steps in a plan or to phase indices; provide the mapping to explicit time-step objects if needed.

7. Sequencing and contiguity requirements
   - If a task enumerates discrete phases/time slots (e.g., morning, afternoon; day1..day3), provide the exact list and any successor order to enforce contiguity.

8. Resources / capacities (if any)
   - If resources exist (chargers, single-use tools) provide exact counts and initial availability. Note: you requested no post-hoc "pay shortfall" — I will encode resource exclusivity directly (e.g., predicates in-use / available).

9. Optimization / costs (optional)
   - Tell me whether the planner must minimize something (plan length or cost). If yes, provide numeric costs per action; I will then use :action-costs and (increase (total-cost) n) effects.

10. Any example plan fragment (optional)
   - If you have an intended ordering of a few actions, include it so I can model ordering predicates accordingly.

If you prefer, paste the audit_report and structured summaries verbatim and I will convert them into PDDL. If you want a template to fill quickly, reply with the following minimal example filled in:

- Agents: ...
- Types: ...
- Objects: ...
- Time slots / phases (ordered): ...
- Initial facts: ...
- Forbidden facts/actions: ...
- Actions (name, params, preconds, add, del): ...
- Goals (final facts): ...
- Minimize cost? (yes/no) and costs per action if yes.

After I receive these, I'll produce:
- A single PDDL domain (between <domain></domain>) with types, predicates, and fully expanded action schemas (distinct names for multi-agent if needed), using only :strips, :typing, :negative-preconditions in :requirements.
- A single PDDL problem (between <problem></problem>) with all objects, initial state, and a goal that fixes every mandated terminal condition. If ordered sequences are implied, I'll add explicit successor predicates and milestone facts so FastDownward cannot reorder steps.

If you have any constraints about planner features (e.g., must be solvable with FastDownward blind search) mention them now.

NATURAL-PLAN sas_plan_10
------------------------------
Below is a clear, human-readable rendering of the supplied plan. Each step is reported in the same order as the plan and includes: the action name, the exact parameters (object identifiers), the time progression (stage/timestamp), the preconditions that are checked at that time, and the effects produced (what is added and what is deleted). Each action advances the discrete stage by one (treated here as one time unit).

Step 1 — Action: sip(object_8, object_0, object_7)
- Time: stage_0 → stage_1 (t = 0 to t = 1; duration = 1 time unit)
- Parameters:
  - o0 = object_8
  - o1 = object_0
  - o2 = object_7
- Preconditions verified at stage_0:
  - hand(object_8)
  - cats(object_0)
  - texture(object_7)
  - next(object_8, object_7)
  - next(object_0, object_7)
- Effects (applied at stage_1):
  - Add: vase(object_8, object_0)
  - Delete: next(object_8, object_7)
- Notes: All preconditions are present in the initial state at stage_0, so the action executes and produces the vase relation while consuming the next(object_8,object_7) token.

Step 2 — Action: memory(object_0, object_7, object_6)
- Time: stage_1 → stage_2 (t = 1 to t = 2; duration = 1 time unit)
- Parameters:
  - o0 = object_0
  - o1 = object_7
  - o2 = object_6
- Preconditions verified at stage_1:
  - cats(object_0)
  - spring(object_7)
  - spring(object_6)
  - next(object_0, object_7)
    (note: next(object_0, object_7) remained true after Step 1)
- Effects (applied at stage_2):
  - Add: next(object_0, object_6)
  - Delete: next(object_0, object_7)
- Notes: This step re-targets object_0’s next pointer from object_7 to object_6, producing next(object_0,object_6) needed by the final step.

Step 3 — Action: paltry(object_8, object_0, object_6)
- Time: stage_2 → stage_3 (t = 2 to t = 3; duration = 1 time unit)
- Parameters:
  - o0 = object_8
  - o1 = object_0
  - o2 = object_6
- Preconditions verified at stage_2:
  - hand(object_8)
  - cats(object_0)
  - texture(object_6)
  - vase(object_8, object_0)      (created by Step 1)
  - next(object_0, object_6)     (created by Step 2)
- Effects (applied at stage_3):
  - Add: next(object_8, object_6)
  - Delete: vase(object_8, object_0)
- Notes: All preconditions hold at stage_2, so this step succeeds and produces the goal predicate.

Final state / Goal achievement:
- After Step 3 (at stage_3), the goal predicate next(object_8, object_6) is true.
- The plan consists exactly of the three actions above and reaches the specified goal in 3 steps / 3 time units.

NATURAL-PLAN sas_plan_1
------------------------------
1) Time 0 — 1 (duration 1)
Action: memory(object_0, object_6, object_5)
Meaning: Move the "next" pointer for object_0 from object_6 to object_5.
Preconditions checked before the action:
- cats object_0 (true in init)
- spring object_6 (true in init)
- spring object_5 (true in init)
- next object_0 object_6 (true in init)
Effects (applied at end of step):
- add next object_0 object_5
- remove next object_0 object_6

2) Time 1 — 2 (duration 1)
Action: sip(object_8, object_0, object_5)
Meaning: Using object_8 and object_0 with reference to object_5, create a vase relation between object_8 and object_0 and remove object_8's "next" link to object_5.
Preconditions checked before the action:
- hand object_8 (true in init)
- cats object_0 (true in init)
- texture object_5 (true in init)
- next object_8 object_5 (true in init)
- next object_0 object_5 (true after step 1)
Effects (applied at end of step):
- add vase object_8 object_0
- remove next object_8 object_5

3) Time 2 — 3 (duration 1)
Action: memory(object_0, object_5, object_6)
Meaning: Move the "next" pointer for object_0 back from object_5 to object_6.
Preconditions checked before the action:
- cats object_0 (true)
- spring object_5 (true in init)
- spring object_6 (true in init)
- next object_0 object_5 (true after step 1, and restored by step 1/unchanged except sip did not touch it)
Effects (applied at end of step):
- add next object_0 object_6
- remove next object_0 object_5

4) Time 3 — 4 (duration 1)
Action: paltry(object_8, object_0, object_6)
Meaning: Using object_8 and object_0 with reference to object_6, set object_8's "next" link to object_6 and remove the vase relation between object_8 and object_0.
Preconditions checked before the action:
- hand object_8 (true)
- cats object_0 (true)
- texture object_6 (true)
- vase object_8 object_0 (created in step 2)
- next object_0 object_6 (restored in step 3)
Effects (applied at end of step):
- add next object_8 object_6
- remove vase object_8 object_0

Summary:
- Total plan cost / total duration: 4 (four unit-duration actions).
- Final relevant facts include next object_7 object_6 (unchanged from init) and next object_8 object_6 (established in step 4). Both goal conjuncts (next object_7 object_6 and next object_8 object_6) are satisfied.

Note: actor_b's private goal set included next object_9 object_6 in the forensic input you supplied; object_9 does not appear in the observed object set (the objects list provided contained only object_0..object_8). Per the instruction "Do not invent resources ... beyond the provided data," I did not create or reference object_9 in the PDDL. If you want a separate problem instance reflecting actor_b's private goal (next object_8 object_7 and next object_9 object_6), please either (a) provide object_9 in the declared object set, or (b) provide an explicit alias mapping that ties object_9 to one of the existing object_i names. Once you supply that, I will produce an additional problem instance (or amend this one) that encodes the necessary initial facts and goals and that enforces any required step ordering explicitly.

The sip actions create vase(object_8,object_0) and vase(object_7,object_0)\n    and delete the respective next subject->6 facts. memory on object_0 re-targets next object_0 object_6 -> next object_0 object_5.\n    Each paltry then requires vase(object_i,object_0) and next object_0 object_5 and produces next object_i object_5, delivering the two goal facts.\n\nScenario 2 (from second STATEMENT):\n  No feasible plan exists under the published action schemas and the given initial facts.\n  Explanation: The goal requires adding next object_9 object_6 while initial state only has next object_9 object_7.\n    Actions that can add next facts for subject object_9 are memory, wretched, paltry/tightfisted (after producing a vase).\n    - memory requires cats object_9 (absent) so cannot retarget object_9.\n    - wretched requires sneeze on the subject (sneeze object_9 absent) and two collect relations to the same stupendous object (collects in the initial state use different collectors), so wretched cannot be applied to object_9.\n    - paltry/tightfisted would need an existing vase object_9 <mid> and a next <mid> object_6. Forming a vase via sip/clip requires a matching common `next ?x ?z` and `next ?y ?z`. For any choice of z that would allow creating vase(object_9, y) one of these next links is missing (we cannot create the needed `next object_9 object_z` without already having next object_9 object_6).\n    Because no action produces cats/sneeze/collect facts and no available causal chain produces the necessary intermediate `next` link, the required next object_9 object_6 cannot be produced. Thus the second scenario is unsalvageable without altering the action schemas or initial facts."

The sip actions create vase(object_8,object_0) and vase(object_7,object_0)\n    and delete the respective next subject->6 facts. memory on object_0 re-targets next object_0 object_6 -> next object_0 object_5.\n    Each paltry then requires vase(object_i,object_0) and next object_0 object_5 and produces next object_i object_5, delivering the two goal facts.\n\nScenario 2 (from second STATEMENT):\n  No feasible plan exists under the published action schemas and the given initial facts.\n  Explanation: The goal requires adding next object_9 object_6 while initial state only has next object_9 object_7.\n    Actions that can add next facts for subject object_9 are memory, wretched, paltry/tightfisted (after producing a vase).\n    - memory requires cats object_9 (absent) so cannot retarget object_9.\n    - wretched requires sneeze on the subject (sneeze object_9 absent) and two collect relations to the same stupendous object (collects in the initial state use different collectors), so wretched cannot be applied to object_9.\n    - paltry/tightfisted would need an existing vase object_9 <mid> and a next <mid> object_6. Forming a vase via sip/clip requires a matching common `next ?x ?z` and `next ?y ?z`. For any choice of z that would allow creating vase(object_9, y) one of these next links is missing (we cannot create the needed `next object_9 object_z` without already having next object_9 object_6).\n    Because no action produces cats/sneeze/collect facts and no available causal chain produces the necessary intermediate `next` link, the required next object_9 object_6 cannot be produced. Thus the second scenario is unsalvageable without altering the action schemas or initial facts."

The sip actions create vase(object_8,object_0) and vase(object_7,object_0)\n    and delete the respective next subject->6 facts. memory on object_0 re-targets next object_0 object_6 -> next object_0 object_5.\n    Each paltry then requires vase(object_i,object_0) and next object_0 object_5 and produces next object_i object_5, delivering the two goal facts.\n\nScenario 2 (from second STATEMENT):\n  No feasible plan exists under the published action schemas and the given initial facts.\n  Explanation: The goal requires adding next object_9 object_6 while initial state only has next object_9 object_7.\n    Actions that can add next facts for subject object_9 are memory, wretched, paltry/tightfisted (after producing a vase).\n    - memory requires cats object_9 (absent) so cannot retarget object_9.\n    - wretched requires sneeze on the subject (sneeze object_9 absent) and two collect relations to the same stupendous object (collects in the initial state use different collectors), so wretched cannot be applied to object_9.\n    - paltry/tightfisted would need an existing vase object_9 <mid> and a next <mid> object_6. Forming a vase via sip/clip requires a matching common `next ?x ?z` and `next ?y ?z`. For any choice of z that would allow creating vase(object_9, y) one of these next links is missing (we cannot create the needed `next object_9 object_z` without already having next object_9 object_6).\n    Because no action produces cats/sneeze/collect facts and no available causal chain produces the necessary intermediate `next` link, the required next object_9 object_6 cannot be produced. Thus the second scenario is unsalvageable without altering the action schemas or initial facts."

The sip actions create vase(object_8,object_0) and vase(object_7,object_0)\n    and delete the respective next subject->6 facts. memory on object_0 re-targets next object_0 object_6 -> next object_0 object_5.\n    Each paltry then requires vase(object_i,object_0) and next object_0 object_5 and produces next object_i object_5, delivering the two goal facts.\n\nScenario 2 (from second STATEMENT):\n  No feasible plan exists under the published action schemas and the given initial facts.\n  Explanation: The goal requires adding next object_9 object_6 while initial state only has next object_9 object_7.\n    Actions that can add next facts for subject object_9 are memory, wretched, paltry/tightfisted (after producing a vase).\n    - memory requires cats object_9 (absent) so cannot retarget object_9.\n    - wretched requires sneeze on the subject (sneeze object_9 absent) and two collect relations to the same stupendous object (collects in the initial state use different collectors), so wretched cannot be applied to object_9.\n    - paltry/tightfisted would need an existing vase object_9 <mid> and a next <mid> object_6. Forming a vase via sip/clip requires a matching common `next ?x ?z` and `next ?y ?z`. For any choice of z that would allow creating vase(object_9, y) one of these next links is missing (we cannot create the needed `next object_9 object_z` without already having next object_9 object_6).\n    Because no action produces cats/sneeze/collect facts and no available causal chain produces the necessary intermediate `next` link, the required next object_9 object_6 cannot be produced. Thus the second scenario is unsalvageable without altering the action schemas or initial facts."

The sip actions create vase(object_8,object_0) and vase(object_7,object_0)\n    and delete the respective next subject->6 facts. memory on object_0 re-targets next object_0 object_6 -> next object_0 object_5.\n    Each paltry then requires vase(object_i,object_0) and next object_0 object_5 and produces next object_i object_5, delivering the two goal facts.\n\nScenario 2 (from second STATEMENT):\n  No feasible plan exists under the published action schemas and the given initial facts.\n  Explanation: The goal requires adding next object_9 object_6 while initial state only has next object_9 object_7.\n    Actions that can add next facts for subject object_9 are memory, wretched, paltry/tightfisted (after producing a vase).\n    - memory requires cats object_9 (absent) so cannot retarget object_9.\n    - wretched requires sneeze on the subject (sneeze object_9 absent) and two collect relations to the same stupendous object (collects in the initial state use different collectors), so wretched cannot be applied to object_9.\n    - paltry/tightfisted would need an existing vase object_9 <mid> and a next <mid> object_6. Forming a vase via sip/clip requires a matching common `next ?x ?z` and `next ?y ?z`. For any choice of z that would allow creating vase(object_9, y) one of these next links is missing (we cannot create the needed `next object_9 object_z` without already having next object_9 object_6).\n    Because no action produces cats/sneeze/collect facts and no available causal chain produces the necessary intermediate `next` link, the required next object_9 object_6 cannot be produced. Thus the second scenario is unsalvageable without altering the action schemas or initial facts."

The sip actions create vase(object_8,object_0) and vase(object_7,object_0)\n    and delete the respective next subject->6 facts. memory on object_0 re-targets next object_0 object_6 -> next object_0 object_5.\n    Each paltry then requires vase(object_i,object_0) and next object_0 object_5 and produces next object_i object_5, delivering the two goal facts.\n\nScenario 2 (from second STATEMENT):\n  No feasible plan exists under the published action schemas and the given initial facts.\n  Explanation: The goal requires adding next object_9 object_6 while initial state only has next object_9 object_7.\n    Actions that can add next facts for subject object_9 are memory, wretched, paltry/tightfisted (after producing a vase).\n    - memory requires cats object_9 (absent) so cannot retarget object_9.\n    - wretched requires sneeze on the subject (sneeze object_9 absent) and two collect relations to the same stupendous object (collects in the initial state use different collectors), so wretched cannot be applied to object_9.\n    - paltry/tightfisted would need an existing vase object_9 <mid> and a next <mid> object_6. Forming a vase via sip/clip requires a matching common `next ?x ?z` and `next ?y ?z`. For any choice of z that would allow creating vase(object_9, y) one of these next links is missing (we cannot create the needed `next object_9 object_z` without already having next object_9 object_6).\n    Because no action produces cats/sneeze/collect facts and no available causal chain produces the necessary intermediate `next` link, the required next object_9 object_6 cannot be produced. Thus the second scenario is unsalvageable without altering the action schemas or initial facts."

The sip actions create vase(object_8,object_0) and vase(object_7,object_0)\n    and delete the respective next subject->6 facts. memory on object_0 re-targets next object_0 object_6 -> next object_0 object_5.\n    Each paltry then requires vase(object_i,object_0) and next object_0 object_5 and produces next object_i object_5, delivering the two goal facts.\n\nScenario 2 (from second STATEMENT):\n  No feasible plan exists under the published action schemas and the given initial facts.\n  Explanation: The goal requires adding next object_9 object_6 while initial state only has next object_9 object_7.\n    Actions that can add next facts for subject object_9 are memory, wretched, paltry/tightfisted (after producing a vase).\n    - memory requires cats object_9 (absent) so cannot retarget object_9.\n    - wretched requires sneeze on the subject (sneeze object_9 absent) and two collect relations to the same stupendous object (collects in the initial state use different collectors), so wretched cannot be applied to object_9.\n    - paltry/tightfisted would need an existing vase object_9 <mid> and a next <mid> object_6. Forming a vase via sip/clip requires a matching common `next ?x ?z` and `next ?y ?z`. For any choice of z that would allow creating vase(object_9, y) one of these next links is missing (we cannot create the needed `next object_9 object_z` without already having next object_9 object_6).\n    Because no action produces cats/sneeze/collect facts and no available causal chain produces the necessary intermediate `next` link, the required next object_9 object_6 cannot be produced. Thus the second scenario is unsalvageable without altering the action schemas or initial facts."

The sip actions create vase(object_8,object_0) and vase(object_7,object_0)\n    and delete the respective next subject->6 facts. memory on object_0 re-targets next object_0 object_6 -> next object_0 object_5.\n    Each paltry then requires vase(object_i,object_0) and next object_0 object_5 and produces next object_i object_5, delivering the two goal facts.\n\nScenario 2 (from second STATEMENT):\n  No feasible plan exists under the published action schemas and the given initial facts.\n  Explanation: The goal requires adding next object_9 object_6 while initial state only has next object_9 object_7.\n    Actions that can add next facts for subject object_9 are memory, wretched, paltry/tightfisted (after producing a vase).\n    - memory requires cats object_9 (absent) so cannot retarget object_9.\n    - wretched requires sneeze on the subject (sneeze object_9 absent) and two collect relations to the same stupendous object (collects in the initial state use different collectors), so wretched cannot be applied to object_9.\n    - paltry/tightfisted would need an existing vase object_9 <mid> and a next <mid> object_6. Forming a vase via sip/clip requires a matching common `next ?x ?z` and `next ?y ?z`. For any choice of z that would allow creating vase(object_9, y) one of these next links is missing (we cannot create the needed `next object_9 object_z` without already having next object_9 object_6).\n    Because no action produces cats/sneeze/collect facts and no available causal chain produces the necessary intermediate `next` link, the required next object_9 object_6 cannot be produced. Thus the second scenario is unsalvageable without altering the action schemas or initial facts."

The sip actions create vase(object_8,object_0) and vase(object_7,object_0)\n    and delete the respective next subject->6 facts. memory on object_0 re-targets next object_0 object_6 -> next object_0 object_5.\n    Each paltry then requires vase(object_i,object_0) and next object_0 object_5 and produces next object_i object_5, delivering the two goal facts.\n\nScenario 2 (from second STATEMENT):\n  No feasible plan exists under the published action schemas and the given initial facts.\n  Explanation: The goal requires adding next object_9 object_6 while initial state only has next object_9 object_7.\n    Actions that can add next facts for subject object_9 are memory, wretched, paltry/tightfisted (after producing a vase).\n    - memory requires cats object_9 (absent) so cannot retarget object_9.\n    - wretched requires sneeze on the subject (sneeze object_9 absent) and two collect relations to the same stupendous object (collects in the initial state use different collectors), so wretched cannot be applied to object_9.\n    - paltry/tightfisted would need an existing vase object_9 <mid> and a next <mid> object_6. Forming a vase via sip/clip requires a matching common `next ?x ?z` and `next ?y ?z`. For any choice of z that would allow creating vase(object_9, y) one of these next links is missing (we cannot create the needed `next object_9 object_z` without already having next object_9 object_6).\n    Because no action produces cats/sneeze/collect facts and no available causal chain produces the necessary intermediate `next` link, the required next object_9 object_6 cannot be produced. Thus the second scenario is unsalvageable without altering the action schemas or initial facts."

The sip actions create vase(object_8,object_0) and vase(object_7,object_0)\n    and delete the respective next subject->6 facts. memory on object_0 re-targets next object_0 object_6 -> next object_0 object_5.\n    Each paltry then requires vase(object_i,object_0) and next object_0 object_5 and produces next object_i object_5, delivering the two goal facts.\n\nScenario 2 (from second STATEMENT):\n  No feasible plan exists under the published action schemas and the given initial facts.\n  Explanation: The goal requires adding next object_9 object_6 while initial state only has next object_9 object_7.\n    Actions that can add next facts for subject object_9 are memory, wretched, paltry/tightfisted (after producing a vase).\n    - memory requires cats object_9 (absent) so cannot retarget object_9.\n    - wretched requires sneeze on the subject (sneeze object_9 absent) and two collect relations to the same stupendous object (collects in the initial state use different collectors), so wretched cannot be applied to object_9.\n    - paltry/tightfisted would need an existing vase object_9 <mid> and a next <mid> object_6. Forming a vase via sip/clip requires a matching common `next ?x ?z` and `next ?y ?z`. For any choice of z that would allow creating vase(object_9, y) one of these next links is missing (we cannot create the needed `next object_9 object_z` without already having next object_9 object_6).\n    Because no action produces cats/sneeze/collect facts and no available causal chain produces the necessary intermediate `next` link, the required next object_9 object_6 cannot be produced. Thus the second scenario is unsalvageable without altering the action schemas or initial facts."

================================================================================


NATURAL-PLAN sas_plan_1
------------------------------
Summary: Follow the given plan exactly. Each step uses actor_a. I assign each action a 1.0 time-unit duration and consecutive timestamps for readability. For each step I list the action, parameters, required preconditions (and whether they are present initially or produced earlier), and the immediate effects. Final goal check is included.

Initial facts used (from the problem's :init):
- cats(object_0)
- hand(object_7), hand(object_8)
- texture(object_5), texture(object_6)
- spring(object_5), spring(object_6)
- next(object_0, object_6), next(object_3, object_5), next(object_4, object_6), next(object_7, object_6), next(object_8, object_6)
- collect(object_5, object_1), collect(object_6, object_2)
- sneeze(object_3), sneeze(object_4)
- stupendous(object_1), stupendous(object_2)

Plan steps (timestamps and verification)

Step 1 — t = 0.0 → 1.0 (duration 1.0)
- Action: actor_a performs sip(object_8, object_0, object_6)
- Schema preconditions for sip(x,y,z): (hand x), (cats y), (texture z), (next x z), (next y z)
- Preconditions checked:
  - hand(object_8) — present in initial facts
  - cats(object_0) — present in initial facts
  - texture(object_6) — present in initial facts
  - next(object_8, object_6) — present in initial facts
  - next(object_0, object_6) — present in initial facts
- All preconditions satisfied.
- Effects (applied immediately at end of step):
  - Add: vase(object_8, object_0)
  - Delete: next(object_8, object_6)

Step 2 — t = 1.0 → 2.0 (duration 1.0)
- Action: actor_a performs sip(object_7, object_0, object_6)
- Preconditions needed (sip):
  - hand(object_7) — present in initial facts
  - cats(object_0) — present in initial facts
  - texture(object_6) — present in initial facts
  - next(object_7, object_6) — present in initial facts
  - next(object_0, object_6) — still present (not deleted by Step 1)
- All preconditions satisfied.
- Effects:
  - Add: vase(object_7, object_0)
  - Delete: next(object_7, object_6)

Step 3 — t = 2.0 → 3.0 (duration 1.0)
- Action: actor_a performs memory(object_0, object_6, object_5)
- Schema preconditions for memory(x,y,z): (cats x), (spring y), (spring z), (next x y)
- Preconditions checked:
  - cats(object_0) — present in initial facts
  - spring(object_6) — present in initial facts
  - spring(object_5) — present in initial facts
  - next(object_0, object_6) — present in initial facts and not deleted by prior steps (both Step 1 and Step 2 deleted next for object_8 and object_7 respectively, but not next(object_0, object_6))
- All preconditions satisfied.
- Effects:
  - Add: next(object_0, object_5)
  - Delete: next(object_0, object_6)

Step 4 — t = 3.0 → 4.0 (duration 1.0)
- Action: actor_a performs paltry(object_8, object_0, object_5)
- Schema preconditions for paltry(x,y,z): (hand x), (cats y), (texture z), (vase x y), (next y z)
- Preconditions checked:
  - hand(object_8) — initial fact (still true)
  - cats(object_0) — initial fact
  - texture(object_5) — initial fact
  - vase(object_8, object_0) — added by Step 1
  - next(object_0, object_5) — added by Step 3
- All preconditions satisfied.
- Effects:
  - Add: next(object_8, object_5)
  - Delete: vase(object_8, object_0)

Step 5 — t = 4.0 → 5.0 (duration 1.0)
- Action: actor_a performs paltry(object_7, object_0, object_5)
- Preconditions (paltry):
  - hand(object_7) — initial fact
  - cats(object_0) — initial fact
  - texture(object_5) — initial fact
  - vase(object_7, object_0) — added by Step 2
  - next(object_0, object_5) — added by Step 3 (still present)
- All preconditions satisfied.
- Effects:
  - Add: next(object_7, object_5)
  - Delete: vase(object_7, object_0)

Final state relevant facts (after all steps)
- next(object_8, object_5) — added in Step 4
- next(object_7, object_5) — added in Step 5
- The goal required:
  - next(object_7, object_5)
  - next(object_8, object_5)
- Both goal facts are true in the final state.

Conclusion: The five-step sequence exactly matches the given plan, all preconditions are present at the times they are required (either from the initial facts or from earlier steps), and the plan achieves the final goal by t = 5.0.

Key blockers:\n- Actions that can create a next relation (paltry, memory, wretched, tightfisted) require predicates (cats on specific objects, spring on endpoints, or sneeze on the source) that are not available for object_9 or the necessary intermediates in Scenario 2.\n- Actions that create vase facts (sip, clip) require the target next relation already to exist (they consume next(...) facts), so they cannot bootstrap a new next object_9 object_8.\n- No action creates sneeze or cats or spring facts; those predicates are only present in initial facts and cannot be manufactured if missing.\nBecause of these constraints, there is no legal sequence that produces next object_9 object_8 from the Scenario 2 initials.\n\nSummary:\n- Proposed executable plan: the four-step plan shown above (memory, sip, memory, paltry) achieves the first scenario goals.\n- The second scenario goal is proven unreachable given the fixed action schemata and the supplied initial facts."

NATURAL-PLAN sas_plan_2
------------------------------
Below is a clear, step-by-step human-readable execution of the provided plan. Each step matches exactly one action from the plan, with the same parameter bindings and the stage progression shown. I give a simple timestamp (unit steps) and list the key preconditions that must hold and the effects produced so you can verify compliance with the specification.

Initial important facts (before step 0)
- current stage: s0
- Relevant initial predicates:
  - (cats object_0), (cats object_1)
  - (hand object_8), (hand object_9)
  - (next object_0 object_6), (next object_1 object_6), (next object_4 object_6),
    (next object_5 object_7), (next object_8 object_7), (next object_9 object_7)
  - (spring object_6), (spring object_7)
  - (texture object_6), (texture object_7)
  - (stupendous object_2), (stupendous object_3)
  - (collect object_6 object_2), (collect object_7 object_3)
- Stage successor chain: s0 -> s1 -> s2 -> s3 -> s4

Step 1 — time 0 to 1 (duration 1)
- Action: memory object_1 object_6 object_7 s0 s1
- Bound parameters:
  - ?o0 = object_1 (cats)
  - ?o1 = object_6 (spring)
  - ?o2 = object_7 (spring)
  - current stage: s0, next stage: s1
- Preconditions checked (all true at time 0):
  - (cats object_1)
  - (spring object_6)
  - (spring object_7)
  - (next object_1 object_6)
  - (current s0) and (succ s0 s1)
- Effects applied at time 1:
  - Add: (next object_1 object_7)    — object_1's next pointer moved to object_7
  - Delete: (next object_1 object_6)
  - Stage: remove (current s0), add (current s1)
- Resulting relevant facts after Step 1:
  - (next object_1 object_7) is now true
  - (next object_1 object_6) is now false
  - current stage = s1

Step 2 — time 1 to 2 (duration 1)
- Action: sip object_9 object_1 object_7 s1 s2
- Bound parameters:
  - ?o0 = object_9 (hand)
  - ?o1 = object_1 (cats)
  - ?o2 = object_7 (texture)
  - current stage: s1, next stage: s2
- Preconditions checked (all true at time 1):
  - (hand object_9)
  - (cats object_1)
  - (texture object_7)
  - (next object_9 object_7)    — was true initially and still true
  - (next object_1 object_7)    — created by Step 1
  - (current s1) and (succ s1 s2)
- Effects applied at time 2:
  - Add: (vase object_9 object_1)
  - Delete: (next object_9 object_7)
  - Stage: remove (current s1), add (current s2)
- Resulting relevant facts after Step 2:
  - (vase object_9 object_1) is true
  - (next object_9 object_7) is now false
  - (next object_1 object_7) still true
  - current stage = s2

Step 3 — time 2 to 3 (duration 1)
- Action: memory object_1 object_7 object_6 s2 s3
- Bound parameters:
  - ?o0 = object_1 (cats)
  - ?o1 = object_7 (spring)
  - ?o2 = object_6 (spring)
  - current stage: s2, next stage: s3
- Preconditions checked (all true at time 2):
  - (cats object_1)
  - (spring object_7)
  - (spring object_6)
  - (next object_1 object_7)    — created in Step 1 and not deleted by Step 2
  - (current s2) and (succ s2 s3)
- Effects applied at time 3:
  - Add: (next object_1 object_6)    — object_1's next pointer moved back to object_6
  - Delete: (next object_1 object_7)
  - Stage: remove (current s2), add (current s3)
- Resulting relevant facts after Step 3:
  - (next object_1 object_6) is true again
  - (next object_1 object_7) is now false
  - current stage = s3

Step 4 — time 3 to 4 (duration 1)
- Action: paltry object_9 object_1 object_6 s3 s4
- Bound parameters:
  - ?o0 = object_9 (hand)
  - ?o1 = object_1 (cats)
  - ?o2 = object_6 (texture)
  - current stage: s3, next stage: s4
- Preconditions checked (all true at time 3):
  - (hand object_9)
  - (cats object_1)
  - (texture object_6)
  - (vase object_9 object_1)      — created in Step 2
  - (next object_1 object_6)      — created in Step 3
  - (current s3) and (succ s3 s4)
- Effects applied at time 4:
  - Add: (next object_9 object_6)    — THIS produces the required goal predicate
  - Delete: (vase object_9 object_1)
  - Stage: remove (current s3), add (current s4)
- Resulting relevant facts after Step 4:
  - (next object_9 object_6) is now true
  - (vase object_9 object_1) is now false
  - current stage = s4

Final verification (after time 4)
- Goal predicates required by the problem:
  - (next object_8 object_7) — remained true throughout (untouched by the plan)
  - (next object_9 object_6) — produced by Step 4 and is true
- Stage reached: s4 (final current stage)
- Total plan cost: 4 (four actions, unit cost each)

Summary (succinct)
1. t=0–1: memory(object_1, object_6, object_7) — moves next of object_1 to object_7; s0→s1
2. t=1–2: sip(object_9, object_1, object_7) — creates vase(object_9,object_1), removes next(object_9,object_7); s1→s2
3. t=2–3: memory(object_1, object_7, object_6) — moves next of object_1 back to object_6; s2→s3
4. t=3–4: paltry(object_9, object_1, object_6) — creates next(object_9,object_6) (goal); s3→s4

No steps were added or removed; each step above corresponds exactly to the actions in the provided plan and the described preconditions/effects show the plan is compliant with the domain and achieves the final goal.

NATURAL-PLAN sas_plan_10

Summary of initial relevant facts (time 0, current = stage_0)
- hand(object_9)
- sneeze(object_3), sneeze(object_4)
- texture(object_5), texture(object_6), texture(object_7), texture(object_8)
- next(object_0, object_7), next(object_3, object_5), next(object_4, object_7), next(object_9, object_7)
- collect(object_7, object_2), collect(object_8, object_2), collect(object_5, object_1), collect(object_6, object_1)
- spring(object_5), spring(object_7)
- stupendous(object_1), stupendous(object_2)
- current(stage_0)

Planned action sequence (each step exactly as in the provided plan). Each step shows timestamp (start→end), duration (1 time unit), applicable preconditions, effects, and the immediate state changes.

Step 1 — clip(object_9, object_4, object_7)  
- Time: 0 → 1 (duration 1) — stage transition stage_0 → stage_1  
- Preconditions checked (all true at time 0):
  - hand(object_9)
  - sneeze(object_4)
  - texture(object_7)
  - next(object_4, object_7)
  - next(object_9, object_7)
  - current(stage_0) and succ(stage_0, stage_1)
- Effects applied at time 1:
  - Add: vase(object_9, object_4)
  - Delete: next(object_9, object_7)
  - Advance current stage: current(stage_0) removed, current(stage_1) added
- Resulting notable facts after Step 1:
  - next(object_9, object_7) is removed
  - vase(object_9, object_4) is present
  - current = stage_1

Step 2 — wretched(object_4, object_7, object_8, object_2)  
- Time: 1 → 2 (duration 1) — stage transition stage_1 → stage_2  
- Preconditions checked (all true at time 1):
  - sneeze(object_4)
  - texture(object_7)
  - texture(object_8)
  - stupendous(object_2)
  - next(object_4, object_7) (remained true after Step 1)
  - collect(object_7, object_2)
  - collect(object_8, object_2)
  - current(stage_1) and succ(stage_1, stage_2)
- Effects applied at time 2:
  - Add: next(object_4, object_8)
  - Delete: next(object_4, object_7)
  - Advance current stage: current(stage_1) removed, current(stage_2) added
- Resulting notable facts after Step 2:
  - next(object_4, object_7) is removed
  - next(object_4, object_8) is present
  - current = stage_2

Step 3 — tightfisted(object_9, object_4, object_8)  
- Time: 2 → 3 (duration 1) — stage transition stage_2 → stage_3  
- Preconditions checked (all true at time 2):
  - hand(object_9)
  - sneeze(object_4)
  - texture(object_8)
  - next(object_4, object_8) (added in Step 2)
  - vase(object_9, object_4) (added in Step 1)
  - current(stage_2) and succ(stage_2, stage_3)
- Effects applied at time 3:
  - Add: next(object_9, object_8)  ← this matches the problem goal
  - Delete: vase(object_9, object_4)
  - Advance current stage: current(stage_2) removed, current(stage_3) added
- Resulting notable facts after Step 3:
  - next(object_9, object_8) is present (goal satisfied)
  - vase(object_9, object_4) removed
  - current = stage_3

Conclusion
- All three actions are applicable in sequence given the initial state and the stage progression constraints.  
- After executing the sequence exactly as given, the goal next(object_9, object_8) holds at time 3.  
- Total plan duration (as reported here): 3 time units.

================================================================================


FINAL-PLAN
------------------------------
I can produce the requested FastDownwards-compatible PDDL domain and problem, but I need the concrete specification details to ensure I do not invent or omit constraints. Please provide the following inputs (or confirm that I should proceed with conservative defaults):

1. Domain name you want used in the PDDL files.

2. Agent roles and their distinct capabilities (e.g., agent types and action names). If there are multiple agents, list each agent type and which actions are unique to it.

3. Normalized action templates (one line per action) describing:
   - action name
   - agent performing it (if applicable)
   - parameters (typed)
   - preconditions (as atomic predicates)
   - effects (atomic positive/negative effects)
   - any ordering constraints relative to other actions (e.g., action A must be done before B)
   - any hard transactional constraints (e.g., "exactly one pickup before deliver", time-slot constraints)

4. Predicates used (normalized vocabulary). If you only provided natural-language descriptions, please map them to predicate names and argument types (for example: (at ?robot - robot ?loc - location), (task-completed ?t - task)).

5. Object universe for the problem: list all objects and their types (agents, locations, tasks, time-slot/day objects, etc.). If there are discrete phases/time slots, provide them and any successor ordering relations (e.g., day1 -> day2 -> day3).

6. Initial facts: every ground predicate true at start.

7. Goal facts: all terminal conditions that must hold (final locations, completed tasks, ordering/phase completion). If there are multiple goal conjuncts, list them.

8. Any strict constraints expressed in natural language that must be encoded as hard constraints (examples: “no agent may perform two actions in the same time-slot,” “task X must be done exactly on day2,” “deliver must follow pickup immediately,” “at most one battery charge per day”). For each, indicate whether it is a global constraint or tied to particular objects.

9. Whether you permit :negative-preconditions in the domain (this is supported by FastDownwards if declared). If not, I will avoid them.

10. Whether you want explicit action costs and use of :action-costs with (increase ...) effects. (Per your instructions, I will not add cost constructs unless required.)

If you prefer I proceed by making conservative assumptions (I will then propose a draft with a minimal set of types: agent, task, location, timeslot; actions: assign, start, complete, move; and model strict ordering and time-slot contiguity), say so and indicate any domain name and number/names of objects you want in the example problem.

Once you supply the above (or consent to the conservative-draft approach), I will produce:
- A PDDL domain enclosed in <domain>...</domain> with :requirements restricted to :strips, :typing, and optionally :negative-preconditions (only if you permit).
- A PDDL problem enclosed in <problem>...</problem> containing the explicit initial facts, object declarations, and a goal that fixes all mandated terminal conditions.
- Explicit ordering predicates and phase objects to enforce sequences and contiguity.
- No penalty-accounting constructs or placeholders; all preferences will be modeled as hard constraints.

Which would you prefer? Provide the details or say “draft” to let me assume a conservative example.

Final state (after t=7):

- All stage-open has moved from stage_0 through to stage_7 (stage-open(stage_7) true).
- Intermediate additions/removals occurred exactly as listed per step.

Plan cost: 7 actions (unit cost each). The sequence above follows the provided plan exactly, and each action’s preconditions are either present initially or produced by a prior step, so the goal next(object_9, object_7) is achieved at t=7.

[PLAN]
================================================================================


FINAL-PLAN
------------------------------
I can produce the requested integrated PDDL domain and problem, but I need the three inputs you referred to: partial_model, execution_trace, and audit_report. You can paste them here (or point me to their contents). To ensure I translate them faithfully and avoid inventing facts, please include the following in each:

1) partial_model (cleaned model)
- The set of agent actions (names), with:
  - parameter lists (typed object names)
  - preconditions (positive and negated predicates)
  - effects (add and delete predicates)
  - any invariants or predicates that must always hold
- The predicate vocabulary (names and arity/typed arguments)
- The object types used
- Any explicit phase or time-slot objects if the domain mentions ordered phases
- Any constraints that are mandatory (treat preferences like “avoid / would rather / earliest / at most / exactly / before X” as hard constraints)

Format suggestion (example):
- types: robot, location, item, phase
- predicates:
  (at ?r - robot ?l - location)
  (holding ?r - robot ?i - item)
  (phase-active ?p - phase)
- actions:
  (move ?r - robot ?from - location ?to - location)
    :pre (and (at ?r ?from) (path ?from ?to) (phase-active P2))
    :eff (and (not (at ?r ?from)) (at ?r ?to) (phase-done P2))
(You can paste the cleaned model in plain text or as a small PDDL fragment.)

2) execution_trace
- An ordered sequence of executed actions (with agent who executed them), including:
  - action name and parameter bindings per step
  - the time index or step number (integers to show order)
  - any observed state changes or deviations
- If some steps were mandated by the auditor or represent partial execution, mark them
Example:
Step 1: robot1 executes (move robot1 locA locB)
Step 2: workerA executes (inspect workerA item1 locB)
…

3) audit_report (auditor recommendations and hard constraints)
- Any mandatory constraints the auditor requires enforced in planning (not suggestions). For example:
  - “Task T must be completed before Task U” → must be encoded as ordering constraint
  - “At most one agent may manipulate item X” → encode as invariant or mutual exclusion
  - “Phase sequence P1 → P2 → P3 must be contiguous” → provide explicit phase objects and successor predicates
  - “No post-hoc penalty actions allowed; violations must be impossible” → e.g., forbid actions that relax constraints, forbid tokens/shortfall actions
- If the auditor counted specific required final states, list them.

If you prefer, tell me which scenario to encode (if multiple exist in your artifacts). If you don’t provide stepwise traces, I can choose a plausible scenario from the model, but to obey your instruction "Do not invent resources, availability, or connectivity beyond the provided data" I need the artifacts to avoid inventing items/objects.

What I will produce once you provide those three inputs:
- A single PDDL domain enclosed in <domain>...</domain> with:
  - :requirements limited to only :strips, :typing, :negative-preconditions (and optionally :action-costs if explicitly required and supported)
  - full predicate and action definitions, with actions attributed to the originating agent in comments or in predicate names where relevant
  - explicit predicates representing ordering (e.g., phase-done, next-phase) so the planner cannot reorder steps
  - no penalty/accounting constructs; hard constraints enforced by preconditions and effects
- A single PDDL problem enclosed in <problem>...</problem> that encodes one scenario (initial state and goal) using consistent object names from your artifacts
- A brief modeling note describing key choices and how auditor constraints were encoded

If you want, paste the three artifacts now (or the minimal necessary parts), and I will return the complete domain and a matching problem.

Summary of initial state (time = stage_0)
- current_stage: stage_0
- hand: object_10
- cats: object_0, object_1
- sneeze: object_4, object_5
- spring: object_6, object_8
- stupendous: object_2, object_3
- texture: object_6, object_7, object_8, object_9

All actions take one stage step (treated here as 1 time unit). Stages map to timestamps: stage_0 → t=0, stage_1 → t=1, ..., stage_6 → t=6.

Execution trace (follow plan exactly)

- Effects applied:
  - Added: next(object_10, object_6)
  - Deleted: vase(object_10, object_0)
  - Advance stage: current_stage = stage_6 (removed stage_5)
- Resulting relevant changes after t=6:
  - next(object_10, object_6) present (this is the goal)
  - vase(object_10, object_0) removed

Goal check after final step (t=6)
- Goal: next(object_10, object_6)
- Status: satisfied (was added in Step 6)

Plan result: Success. Each action executed in order, all preconditions were satisfied at time of execution, and the final goal next(object_10, object_6) is achieved at t=6. Total time / cost: 6 time units (one per action).

================================================================================


FINAL-PLAN
------------------------------
I don’t yet have the canonical world_model, plan_candidates, or audit_report you referenced. I can’t safely invent facts or constraints because you required that I not introduce resources, availability, connectivity, or preferences beyond the provided data.

Please paste the three artifacts (world_model, plan_candidates, audit_report). To make a valid FastDownwards-ready domain + problem I need the following from them (or you can provide them in a single message):

1. World model (must include):
   - Agent roles (names) and which actions each role can perform.
   - Action descriptions: action name, parameters, preconditions, and effects (in natural language if not PDDL).
   - Object types and an explicit object list (locations, items, time slots/phases if any).
   - Initial facts (who/what is where, what is available, initial status of tasks).
   - Any explicit ordering or phase structure (e.g., day1 → day2, phase A before B).
   - Hard constraints/preferences that must be enforced (phrased as hard rules).

2. Plan candidates:
   - The candidate plans you want encoded or that the auditor evaluated (sequence of agent actions with parameters and ordering).
   - If a particular candidate is chosen, indicate which one. If multiple should be supported, indicate that.

3. Auditor's report:
   - Identified inconsistencies or required corrections to the world_model (e.g., missing preconditions, unreachable goals, concurrency conflicts).
   - Any required causal integrity constraints (e.g., resource exclusivity, required ordering between actions).
   - Any preferences that must be converted into strict constraints (the auditor may say “must be finished by X” or “cannot do Y before Z”).

Optional but helpful:
   - Whether to model time discretely (time steps/slots). If yes, give number of time steps or phases.
   - Whether action durations or costs are needed (note: only :action-costs with (increase ...) allowed if you truly need them).
   - Any names you prefer for predicates, types, or the domain/problem.

If you prefer, paste the three artifacts verbatim and I will extract the necessary details and resolve ambiguities (documenting any assumptions inside PDDL comments as required). Once I have them I will produce:
- A PDDL domain between <domain></domain> tags with only :requirements = :strips, :typing, :negative-preconditions (and optionally :action-costs if needed).
- A PDDL problem between <problem></problem> tags that instantiates objects and initial state, contains comments documenting assumptions, and enforces ordering and constraints so violating plans are impossible.
- Agent actions kept distinct if semantics differ, and all preferences encoded as hard constraints.
- No bookkeeping/penalty constructs; no placeholders.

Send the world_model, plan_candidates, and audit_report and I’ll synthesize the PDDL.

NATURAL-PLAN sas_plan_10
------------------------------
Summary: Execute the three planned actions in order. Each step lists the action, the grounded parameters, a brief timestamp/duration, the key preconditions used (from the initial state or earlier effects), and the effects produced. This sequence exactly follows the given plan and achieves the scenario_1 goals (next object_10 object_5) and (next object_9 object_7).

1) Time 00:00 → 00:01 — Action: clip(object_9, object_4, object_8) [stage_1 → stage_2]
   - Preconditions used:
     - available(stage_1) and succ(stage_1, stage_2) (stage token for step 1)
     - hand(object_9) (initial fact)
     - sneeze(object_4) (initial fact)
     - texture(object_8) (initial fact)
     - next(object_4, object_8) (initial fact)
     - next(object_9, object_8) (initial fact)
   - Effects:
     - consumes available(stage_1) and makes available(stage_2)
     - adds vase(object_9, object_4)
     - deletes next(object_9, object_8)
   - Notes: This establishes the vase between object_9 and object_4 needed later, and removes the previous next relation from object_9 to object_8.

2) Time 00:01 → 00:02 — Action: wretched(object_4, object_8, object_7, object_2) [stage_2 → stage_3]
   - Preconditions used:
     - available(stage_2) and succ(stage_2, stage_3) (stage token for step 2)
     - sneeze(object_4) (initial fact)
     - texture(object_8) and texture(object_7) (initial facts)
     - stupendous(object_2) (initial fact)
     - next(object_4, object_8) (initial fact still true at this point)
     - collect(object_8, object_2) and collect(object_7, object_2) (initial facts)
   - Effects:
     - consumes available(stage_2) and makes available(stage_3)
     - adds next(object_4, object_7)
     - deletes next(object_4, object_8)
   - Notes: This moves the "next" relation for object_4 from object_8 to object_7, producing the intermediate relation needed for the final step.

3) Time 00:02 → 00:03 — Action: tightfisted(object_9, object_4, object_7) [stage_3 → stage_4]
   - Preconditions used:
     - available(stage_3) and succ(stage_3, stage_4) (stage token for step 3)
     - hand(object_9) (initial fact)
     - sneeze(object_4) (initial fact)
     - texture(object_7) (initial fact)
     - next(object_4, object_7) (produced by step 2)
     - vase(object_9, object_4) (produced by step 1)
   - Effects:
     - consumes available(stage_3) and makes available(stage_4)
     - adds next(object_9, object_7)
     - deletes vase(object_9, object_4)
   - Notes: This produces the required goal relation next(object_9, object_7).

Final state with respect to goals:
- next(object_10, object_5) — was true in the initial state and remains true (goal satisfied).
- next(object_9, object_7) — produced by step 3 (goal satisfied).

Plan cost: 3 actions (unit cost per action).

FastDownwards compatibility notes and solver-relevant choices:
- Requirements: only :strips, :typing, and :negative-preconditions are used. No ADL constructs (no universal quantifiers, no conditional effects), enabling compatibility with FastDownwards' STRIPS-based backends while allowing explicit negation in preconditions.
- Typing: domain and problems declare types (agent, item, location) to keep signatures explicit and avoid arity/type mismatches.
- Negative preconditions are used only to forbid re-doing steps (e.g., not (picked ?i), not (transported ?i), not (assembled ?i)). These are supported by FastDownwards.
- No action costs or :action-costs are included. All preferences and "would rather / at most / earliest / exactly" style natural-language constraints were translated to hard logical constraints (preconditions and goal facts), as required. No penalty-accounting constructs (tokens, quotas, shortfalls) were introduced.
- Ordered sequences per item are enforced explicitly via predicates picked, transported, and assembled. As a result, the planner cannot reorder per-item steps: assemble requires transported, and transported is set only by loader_place which requires prior holding (set by loader_pick). This enforces pickup -> move/place -> assemble per item.
- All causal effects are explicit. There are no placeholder predicates or omitted definitions.
- Problem files fully enumerate objects and initial facts. Where a global "all items must be picked before transport phase advances" was implied in general specifications, we instead enforced ordering per-item (pickup -> transport -> assemble) because the domain file must be generic; per-instance global-phase-advance actions that require listing every item would be problem-specific. If a strict global-phase gating (waiting for completion of every item before moving any item to the next global phase) is required, that must be provided as explicit per-instance constraints (advance actions whose preconditions include every item); the current modeling enforces per-item contiguity and prevents ping-pong reordering of steps for each item.
- No placeholders or invented capabilities beyond the described loader/assembler pattern were added. All actions are prefixed to indicate agent origin (loader_*, assembler_*), keeping agents' action spaces distinct.

NATURAL-PLAN sas_plan_10
------------------------------
Plan (5 actions, each 1 time unit; total cost = 5). Each step lists the action, its exact arguments (including stage transition), the assumed preconditions that allow it to fire, and the explicit effects produced.

Step 1 — time 0.0 → 1.0
Action: clip object_10 object_3 object_5 (stage s0 → s1)
- Preconditions (satisfied at start):
  - current s0, succ s0 s1
  - hand object_10
  - sneeze object_3
  - texture object_5
  - next object_3 object_5
  - next object_10 object_5
- Effects (applied at time 1.0):
  - add: vase object_10 object_3
  - delete: next object_10 object_5
  - advance stage: unset current s0, set current s1

Step 2 — time 1.0 → 2.0
Action: clip object_9 object_3 object_5 (stage s1 → s2)
- Preconditions:
  - current s1, succ s1 s2
  - hand object_9
  - sneeze object_3
  - texture object_5
  - next object_3 object_5
  - next object_9 object_5
- Effects (applied at time 2.0):
  - add: vase object_9 object_3
  - delete: next object_9 object_5
  - advance stage: unset current s1, set current s2

Step 3 — time 2.0 → 3.0
Action: wretched object_3 object_5 object_6 object_1 (stage s2 → s3)
- Preconditions:
  - current s2, succ s2 s3
  - sneeze object_3
  - texture object_5
  - texture object_6
  - stupendous object_1
  - next object_3 object_5
  - collect object_5 object_1
  - collect object_6 object_1
- Effects (applied at time 3.0):
  - add: next object_3 object_6
  - delete: next object_3 object_5
  - advance stage: unset current s2, set current s3

Step 4 — time 3.0 → 4.0
Action: tightfisted object_10 object_3 object_6 (stage s3 → s4)
- Preconditions:
  - current s3, succ s3 s4
  - hand object_10
  - sneeze object_3
  - texture object_6
  - next object_3 object_6
  - vase object_10 object_3
- Effects (applied at time 4.0):
  - add: next object_10 object_6
  - delete: vase object_10 object_3
  - advance stage: unset current s3, set current s4

Step 5 — time 4.0 → 5.0
Action: tightfisted object_9 object_3 object_6 (stage s4 → s5)
- Preconditions:
  - current s4, succ s4 s5
  - hand object_9
  - sneeze object_3
  - texture object_6
  - next object_3 object_6
  - vase object_9 object_3
- Effects (applied at time 5.0):
  - add: next object_9 object_6
  - delete: vase object_9 object_3
  - advance stage: unset current s4, set current s5

Result after Step 5 (time = 5.0)
- Goals achieved:
  - next object_10 object_6 (established at Step 4)
  - next object_9 object_6 (established at Step 5)

Notes:
- Each action corresponds exactly to one plan step and advances the discrete stage by one (s0→s1→s2→s3→s4→s5).
- Each action was treated as taking 1.0 time unit (consistent with total cost = 5).

NATURAL-PLAN sas_plan_10
------------------------------
Below is a concise, human-readable trace of the given plan. Each step lists the action, its object parameters, the start→end timestamp, required preconditions (stating whether they are satisfied at that time), the action effects (what is added and what is deleted), and a one-line plain-English description.

1) Step 1 — clip object_10 object_4 object_6  (t0 → t1)
   - Preconditions (required at t0):
     - (hand object_10) — satisfied (given in init)
     - (sneeze object_4) — satisfied (given in init)
     - (texture object_6) — satisfied (given in init)
     - (next object_4 object_6) — satisfied (given in init)
     - (next object_10 object_6) — satisfied (given in init)
     - (last-time t0) and (succ t0 t1) — satisfied (time chain in init)
   - Effects (applied at t1):
     - ADD: (vase object_10 object_4)
     - DELETE: (next object_10 object_6)
     - last-time updated from t0 to t1
   - Description: Using object_10 and object_4 with context object_6, create vase(object_10,object_4) and remove the link next(object_10,object_6). (Time advances t0→t1.)

2) Step 2 — wretched object_4 object_6 object_7 object_2  (t1 → t2)
   - Preconditions (required at t1):
     - (sneeze object_4) — satisfied (init)
     - (texture object_6) — satisfied (init)
     - (texture object_7) — satisfied (init)
     - (stupendous object_2) — satisfied (init)
     - (next object_4 object_6) — satisfied (still present at t1)
     - (collect object_6 object_2) — satisfied (init)
     - (collect object_7 object_2) — satisfied (init)
     - (last-time t1) and (succ t1 t2) — satisfied (from previous step/time chain)
   - Effects (applied at t2):
     - ADD: (next object_4 object_7)
     - DELETE: (next object_4 object_6)
     - last-time updated from t1 to t2
   - Description: Reroute object_4’s successor from object_6 to object_7 (produces next(object_4,object_7) and removes next(object_4,object_6)). (Time t1→t2.)

3) Step 3 — tightfisted object_10 object_4 object_7  (t2 → t3)
   - Preconditions (required at t2):
     - (hand object_10) — satisfied (init)
     - (sneeze object_4) — satisfied (init)
     - (texture object_7) — satisfied (init)
     - (next object_4 object_7) — satisfied (created in Step 2)
     - (vase object_10 object_4) — satisfied (created in Step 1)
     - (last-time t2) and (succ t2 t3) — satisfied
   - Effects (applied at t3):
     - ADD: (next object_10 object_7)
     - DELETE: (vase object_10 object_4)

   - Description: Use the vase linking object_11→object_5 and the link object_5→object_8 to create next(object_11,object_8) (goal fact for object_11). (Time t6→t7.)

Final status (after t7):
 - Goal facts achieved:
   - (next object_10 object_7) — created at t3 (Step 3)
   - (next object_11 object_8) — created at t7 (Step 7)
 - Plan cost: 7 actions (unit cost per step).

This sequence strictly follows the provided plan steps and timestamps, lists required preconditions and effects for each action, and shows that both goal predicates are produced by the trace.

Step 11 — time 11.0 (duration 1.0)
- Action: paltry object_9 object_0 object_7
- Parameter binding: ?h = object_9 (hand), ?c = object_0 (cats), ?t = object_7 (obj)
- Preconditions checked: (texture object_7), (vase object_9 object_0), (next object_0 object_7)
- Effects applied:
  - Add: (next object_9 object_7)
  - Delete: (vase object_9 object_0)
- Short description: Assign object_9’s next→object_7 (consumes vase(object_9,object_0)).

Step 12 — time 12.0 (duration 1.0)
- Action: paltry object_11 object_0 object_7
- Parameter binding: ?h = object_11 (hand), ?c = object_0 (cats), ?t = object_7 (obj)
- Preconditions checked: (texture object_7), (vase object_11 object_0), (next object_0 object_7)
- Effects applied:
  - Add: (next object_11 object_7)
  - Delete: (vase object_11 object_0)
- Short description: Assign object_11’s next→object_7 (consumes vase(object_11,object_0)).

Final state relevant to the goal (after step 12)
- (next object_10 object_7) — established at Step 3 (tightfisted object_10 ...)
- (next object_11 object_7) — established at Step 12 (paltry object_11 ...)
- (next object_9 object_7)  — established at Step 11 (paltry object_9 ...)
- These three required goal facts are all present, so the plan achieves the goal.

Notes about timing/duration:
- I used unit durations for each action (duration = 1.0) and consecutive integer start times (0.0 to 12.0), matching the plan’s 13 unit-cost steps. The ordering is exactly as provided by the plan and is causally consistent with the preconditions/effects described in the domain.

If you want, I can:
- Produce a compact table mapping each plan step to the operator schema name and the exact predicates that justified the step, or
- Produce a timeline visualization showing when each predicate is created and deleted.

NATURAL-PLAN sas_plan_10
------------------------------
Execution trace (stepwise simulation of the given plan). Each step lists: action, start timestamp (current stage) -> end timestamp (next stage), required preconditions with whether they were present at that moment, and postconditions (facts added / facts removed). All timestamps are the stage symbols from the problem (st0..st18). No precondition violations occurred.
