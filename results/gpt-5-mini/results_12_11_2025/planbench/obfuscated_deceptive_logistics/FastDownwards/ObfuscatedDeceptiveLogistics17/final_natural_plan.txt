- (next object_11 object_9) — added at step 14
- (next object_12 object_7) — added at step 21
- (next object_13 object_9) — added at step 13

All four goal next-relations are present; the plan matches the provided PDDL plan exactly and is compliant with the action schemas and initial facts from the specification.
