Below is a clear, step-by-step human-readable execution trace that follows the provided plan exactly (12 actions). Each step is given a timestamp (stage number → time), a nominal duration of 1 time unit, a short description of the action (grounded parameters), the key preconditions that were true when the action executed, and the primary effects (which facts were added and which were removed). The steps are shown in the exact order of the plan; nothing is added or removed.

Step 1 — time 0 → 1 (duration 1)
Action: sip(object_12, object_1, object_8)
- Preconditions satisfied: hand(object_12); cats(object_1); texture(object_8); next(object_12, object_8); next(object_1, object_8); free-stage(stage_0) and succ(stage_0,stage_1).
- Effects: add vase(object_12, object_1). Remove next(object_12, object_8). Advance free-stage to stage_1.

Step 2 — time 1 → 2 (duration 1)
Action: memory(object_1, object_8, object_6)
- Preconditions satisfied: cats(object_1); spring(object_8); spring(object_6); next(object_1, object_8); free-stage(stage_1) and succ(stage_1,stage_2).
- Effects: add next(object_1, object_6). Remove next(object_1, object_8). Advance free-stage to stage_2.

Step 3 — time 2 → 3 (duration 1)
Action: paltry(object_12, object_1, object_6)
- Preconditions satisfied: hand(object_12); cats(object_1); texture(object_6); vase(object_12, object_1); next(object_1, object_6); free-stage(stage_2) and succ(stage_2,stage_3).
- Effects: add next(object_12, object_6). Remove vase(object_12, object_1). Advance free-stage to stage_3.

Step 4 — time 3 → 4 (duration 1)
Action: clip(object_10, object_4, object_7)
- Preconditions satisfied: hand(object_10); sneeze(object_4); texture(object_7); next(object_4, object_7); next(object_10, object_7); free-stage(stage_3) and succ(stage_3,stage_4).
- Effects: add vase(object_10, object_4). Remove next(object_10, object_7). Advance free-stage to stage_4.

Step 5 — time 4 → 5 (duration 1)
Action: clip(object_11, object_5, object_9)
- Preconditions satisfied: hand(object_11); sneeze(object_5); texture(object_9); next(object_5, object_9); next(object_11, object_9); free-stage(stage_4) and succ(stage_4,stage_5).
- Effects: add vase(object_11, object_5). Remove next(object_11, object_9). Advance free-stage to stage_5.

Step 6 — time 5 → 6 (duration 1)
Action: wretched(object_5, object_9, object_8, object_3)
- Preconditions satisfied: sneeze(object_5); texture(object_9); texture(object_8); stupendous(object_3); next(object_5, object_9); collect(object_9, object_3); collect(object_8, object_3); free-stage(stage_5) and succ(stage_5,stage_6).
- Effects: add next(object_5, object_8). Remove next(object_5, object_9). Advance free-stage to stage_6.

Step 7 — time 6 → 7 (duration 1)
Action: tightfisted(object_11, object_5, object_8)
- Preconditions satisfied: hand(object_11); sneeze(object_5); texture(object_8); next(object_5, object_8); vase(object_11, object_5); free-stage(stage_6) and succ(stage_6,stage_7).
- Effects: add next(object_11, object_8). Remove vase(object_11, object_5). Advance free-stage to stage_7.

Step 8 — time 7 → 8 (duration 1)
Action: wretched(object_4, object_7, object_6, object_2)
- Preconditions satisfied: sneeze(object_4); texture(object_7); texture(object_6); stupendous(object_2); next(object_4, object_7); collect(object_7, object_2); collect(object_6, object_2); free-stage(stage_7) and succ(stage_7,stage_8).
- Effects: add next(object_4, object_6). Remove next(object_4, object_7). Advance free-stage to stage_8.

Step 9 — time 8 → 9 (duration 1)
Action: tightfisted(object_10, object_4, object_6)
- Preconditions satisfied: hand(object_10); sneeze(object_4); texture(object_6); next(object_4, object_6); vase(object_10, object_4); free-stage(stage_8) and succ(stage_8,stage_9).
- Effects: add next(object_10, object_6). Remove vase(object_10, object_4). Advance free-stage to stage_9.
- Note: This step establishes next(object_10, object_6) required by the goal.

Step 10 — time 9 → 10 (duration 1)
Action: clip(object_12, object_4, object_6)
- Preconditions satisfied: hand(object_12); sneeze(object_4); texture(object_6); next(object_4, object_6); next(object_12, object_6); free-stage(stage_9) and succ(stage_9,stage_10).
- Effects: add vase(object_12, object_4). Remove next(object_12, object_6). Advance free-stage to stage_10.

Step 11 — time 10 → 11 (duration 1)
Action: wretched(object_4, object_6, object_7, object_2)
- Preconditions satisfied: sneeze(object_4); texture(object_6); texture(object_7); stupendous(object_2); next(object_4, object_6); collect(object_6, object_2); collect(object_7, object_2); free-stage(stage_10) and succ(stage_10,stage_11).
- Effects: add next(object_4, object_7). Remove next(object_4, object_6). Advance free-stage to stage_11.

Step 12 — time 11 → 12 (duration 1)
Action: tightfisted(object_12, object_4, object_7)
- Preconditions satisfied: hand(object_12); sneeze(object_4); texture(object_7); next(object_4, object_7); vase(object_12, object_4); free-stage(stage_11) and succ(stage_11,stage_12).
- Effects: add next(object_12, object_7). Remove vase(object_12, object_4). Advance free-stage to stage_12.
- Note: This step establishes next(object_12, object_7) required by the goal.

Final state summary (relevant goal facts)
- next(object_10, object_6) — achieved at Step 9 and still true at the end.
- next(object_11, object_8) — achieved at Step 7 and still true at the end.
- next(object_12, object_7) — achieved at Step 12 (final step).
- next(object_13, object_9) — was present in the initial state and was never removed.

Goal verification: After the 12th action (time 12), all four goal relations are true:
- next(object_10, object_6)
- next(object_11, object_8)
- next(object_12, object_7)
- next(object_13, object_9)

This completes the exact plan trace, with each action executed in sequence and with the stage-based timestamps shown.
