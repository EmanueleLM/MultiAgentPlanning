Below is a clear, step-by-step human-readable execution of the provided plan. Steps are listed in order and each step shows: (1) the action name and its object parameters, (2) a short natural-language description of what the action requires (preconditions) and what it does (effects), and (3) a simple timestamp schedule (starting at t=0.0 s, each step assumed to take 1.0 s). The sequence exactly matches the supplied plan (no actions added or removed). Final goal achieved: next object_11 object_10. Total plan cost: 12 (unit cost).

Step 1 — t = 0.0s → 1.0s
Action: wretched object_3 object_7 object_5 object_1
- Preconditions (used): object_3 has sneeze; object_7 and object_5 have texture; object_1 is stupendous; next(object_3, object_7) holds; collect(object_7, object_1) and collect(object_5, object_1) hold.
- Effect (what it does): replace next(object_3, object_7) with next(object_3, object_5). (next object_3 now points to object_5; previous link to object_7 removed.)
  
Step 2 — t = 1.0s → 2.0s
Action: wretched object_3 object_5 object_6 object_1
- Preconditions: object_3 sneeze; object_5 and object_6 texture; object_1 stupendous; next(object_3, object_5) must hold; collect(object_5, object_1) and collect(object_6, object_1) hold.
- Effect: replace next(object_3, object_5) with next(object_3, object_6).

Step 3 — t = 2.0s → 3.0s
Action: clip object_11 object_3 object_6
- Preconditions: object_11 hand; object_3 sneeze; object_6 texture; next(object_3, object_6) and next(object_11, object_6) must hold.
- Effect: add vase(object_11, object_3) and remove next(object_11, object_6). (object_11 loses its next-to object_6 link; object_11 becomes vase-related to object_3.)

Step 4 — t = 3.0s → 4.0s
Action: wretched object_3 object_6 object_5 object_1
- Preconditions: object_3 sneeze; object_6 and object_5 texture; object_1 stupendous; next(object_3, object_6) must hold; collect(object_6, object_1) and collect(object_5, object_1) hold.
- Effect: replace next(object_3, object_6) with next(object_3, object_5).

Step 5 — t = 4.0s → 5.0s
Action: tightfisted object_11 object_3 object_5
- Preconditions: object_11 hand; object_3 sneeze; object_5 texture; next(object_3, object_5) must hold; vase(object_11, object_3) must hold.
- Effect: add next(object_11, object_5) and remove vase(object_11, object_3). (object_11 gains next-to object_5.)

Step 6 — t = 5.0s → 6.0s
Action: memory object_0 object_8 object_5
- Preconditions: object_0 cats; object_8 and object_5 spring; next(object_0, object_8) must hold.
- Effect: replace next(object_0, object_8) with next(object_0, object_5). (object_0 now points to object_5 instead of object_8.)

Step 7 — t = 6.0s → 7.0s
Action: sip object_11 object_0 object_5
- Preconditions: object_11 hand; object_0 cats; object_5 texture; next(object_11, object_5) and next(object_0, object_5) must hold.
- Effect: add vase(object_11, object_0) and remove next(object_11, object_5). (object_11 loses the next-to object_5 link and becomes vase-related to object_0.)

Step 8 — t = 7.0s → 8.0s
Action: memory object_0 object_5 object_8
- Preconditions: object_0 cats; object_5 and object_8 spring; next(object_0, object_5) must hold.
- Effect: replace next(object_0, object_5) with next(object_0, object_8). (object_0 returns to pointing at object_8.)

Step 9 — t = 8.0s → 9.0s
Action: paltry object_11 object_0 object_8
- Preconditions: object_11 hand; object_0 cats; object_8 texture; vase(object_11, object_0) must hold; next(object_0, object_8) must hold.
- Effect: add next(object_11, object_8) and remove vase(object_11, object_0). (object_11 gains next-to object_8.)

Step 10 — t = 9.0s → 10.0s
Action: clip object_11 object_4 object_8
- Preconditions: object_11 hand; object_4 sneeze; object_8 texture; next(object_4, object_8) and next(object_11, object_8) must hold.
- Effect: add vase(object_11, object_4) and remove next(object_11, object_8). (object_11 becomes vase-related to object_4.)

Step 11 — t = 10.0s → 11.0s
Action: wretched object_4 object_8 object_10 object_2
- Preconditions: object_4 sneeze; object_8 and object_10 texture; object_2 stupendous; next(object_4, object_8) must hold; collect(object_8, object_2) and collect(object_10, object_2) hold.
- Effect: replace next(object_4, object_8) with next(object_4, object_10).

Step 12 — t = 11.0s → 12.0s
Action: tightfisted object_11 object_4 object_10
- Preconditions: object_11 hand; object_4 sneeze; object_10 texture; next(object_4, object_10) must hold; vase(object_11, object_4) must hold.
- Effect: add next(object_11, object_10) and remove vase(object_11, object_4). (object_11 now points to object_10.)

Final state check (after t = 12.0s)
- Goal predicate next(object_11, object_10) holds. Goal satisfied.
- Plan cost: 12 (unit cost).

Notes:
- Each step above corresponds exactly to one action in the supplied plan and uses the same object parameters.
- Timestamps/durations are illustrative and uniform (1.0 s per step) to show order and timing; the domain does not require numeric durations.
