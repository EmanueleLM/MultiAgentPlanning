Summary: the plan executes four actions in sequence, advancing the discrete stage clock one step per action (stage_0 -> stage_1 -> stage_2 -> stage_3 -> stage_4). I use 1 time unit per action: stage_n corresponds to time t = n. Each step lists the action, parameters, time window, checked preconditions (and where they came from), and effects applied. The final goal (next object_12 object_11) is achieved after step 4. Total plan cost = 4 (unit cost per action).

Step 1
- Action: wretched(object_5, object_9, object_10, object_3)
- Time: t = 0 → 1 (stage_0 -> stage_1)
- Required preconditions (checked at t=0):
  - sneeze object_5 — satisfied (initial state)
  - texture object_9 — satisfied (initial state)
  - texture object_10 — satisfied (initial state)
  - stupendous object_3 — satisfied (initial state)
  - next object_5 object_9 — satisfied (initial state)
  - collect object_9 object_3 — satisfied (initial state)
  - collect object_10 object_3 — satisfied (initial state)
- Effects (applied at t=1):
  - Add: next object_5 object_10
  - Remove: next object_5 object_9
  - Advance stage: current stage moves from stage_0 to stage_1

Step 2
- Action: clip(object_12, object_5, object_10)
- Time: t = 1 → 2 (stage_1 -> stage_2)
- Required preconditions (checked at t=1):
  - hand object_12 — satisfied (initial state)
  - sneeze object_5 — satisfied (initial state)
  - texture object_10 — satisfied (initial state)
  - next object_5 object_10 — satisfied (added by Step 1)
  - next object_12 object_10 — satisfied (initial state)
- Effects (applied at t=2):
  - Add: vase object_12 object_5
  - Remove: next object_12 object_10
  - Advance stage: current stage moves from stage_1 to stage_2

Step 3
- Action: wretched(object_5, object_10, object_11, object_3)
- Time: t = 2 → 3 (stage_2 -> stage_3)
- Required preconditions (checked at t=2):
  - sneeze object_5 — satisfied (initial state)
  - texture object_10 — satisfied (initial state)
  - texture object_11 — satisfied (initial state)
  - stupendous object_3 — satisfied (initial state)
  - next object_5 object_10 — satisfied (added by Step 1 and not removed by Step 2)
  - collect object_10 object_3 — satisfied (initial state)
  - collect object_11 object_3 — satisfied (initial state)
- Effects (applied at t=3):
  - Add: next object_5 object_11
  - Remove: next object_5 object_10
  - Advance stage: current stage moves from stage_2 to stage_3

Step 4
- Action: tightfisted(object_12, object_5, object_11)
- Time: t = 3 → 4 (stage_3 -> stage_4)
- Required preconditions (checked at t=3):
  - hand object_12 — satisfied (initial state)
  - sneeze object_5 — satisfied (initial state)
  - texture object_11 — satisfied (initial state)
  - next object_5 object_11 — satisfied (added by Step 3)
  - vase object_12 object_5 — satisfied (added by Step 2)
- Effects (applied at t=4):
  - Add: next object_12 object_11
  - Remove: vase object_12 object_5
  - Advance stage: current stage moves from stage_3 to stage_4

Final state check
- The goal (next object_12 object_11) is present after Step 4 (t = 4). Goal achieved.
- No steps were added or removed; all preconditions were available when required (either from the initial state or from previous steps).
- Total plan cost: 4 (1 per action).
