Below is a human-readable, step-by-step execution of the given plan. Each step corresponds exactly to one action in the plan, lists start and end timestamps (stage indices), states the required preconditions (as given in the domain), confirms they are satisfied at execution time, and reports the exact add and delete effects (which predicates change). Each action consumes one stage (duration = 1 time unit: start stage -> next stage).

Summary of time mapping: stage_N → time N. Each action runs from stage_N to stage_N+1 and takes 1 time unit.

Final verification (after time 17):
- Goal predicates required:
  - (next object_11 object_7) — present (added in step 17).
  - (next object_12 object_5) — present (added in step 14).
- Both goal facts hold. Plan completes successfully at time 17 (now stage_17). No step violated preconditions or caused contradictory effects relative to the plan trace above.

If you want, I can also provide a compact table of the added/deleted predicates per step, or a cumulative state snapshot of all relevant predicates after each action.
