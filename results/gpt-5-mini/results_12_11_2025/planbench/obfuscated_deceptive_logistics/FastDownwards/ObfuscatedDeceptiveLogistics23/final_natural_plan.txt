Below is a clear, step-by-step human-readable trace of the given plan. Each step corresponds exactly to one action in the plan, shows a timestamp (10 s increments), lists the grounded preconditions and the immediate effects (positive and negative) according to the domain specification, and gives a short plain-English description. The final section confirms that the planning goals are achieved.

Step 1 — t = 0 s
Action: clip(object_12, object_5, object_11)
- Preconditions (required true before the action):
  - hand object_12
  - sneeze object_5
  - texture object_11
  - next object_5 object_11
  - next object_12 object_11
- Effects (applied at this step):
  - Add: vase object_12 object_5
  - Delete: next object_12 object_11
- Plain English: Using hand object_12 with sneeze-object object_5 and texture anchor object_11, create a vase relationship (object_12 ↔ object_5) and remove the link next(object_12, object_11).

Step 2 — t = 10 s
Action: wretched(object_3, object_7, object_6, object_1)
- Preconditions:
  - sneeze object_3
  - texture object_7
  - texture object_6
  - stupendous object_1
  - next object_3 object_7
  - collect object_7 object_1
  - collect object_6 object_1
- Effects:
  - Add: next object_3 object_6
  - Delete: next object_3 object_7
- Plain English: From object_3 (sneeze) and the textures on object_7 and object_6 (with stupendous object_1 and required collects), redirect the pointer from object_3→object_7 to object_3→object_6.

Step 3 — t = 20 s
Action: clip(object_11, object_3, object_6)
- Preconditions:
  - hand object_11
  - sneeze object_3
  - texture object_6
  - next object_3 object_6
  - next object_11 object_6
- Effects:
  - Add: vase object_11 object_3
  - Delete: next object_11 object_6
- Plain English: Using hand object_11 and sneeze-object object_3 anchored at texture object_6, create vase(object_11, object_3) and remove the link next(object_11, object_6).

Step 4 — t = 30 s
Action: wretched(object_3, object_6, object_7, object_1)
- Preconditions:
  - sneeze object_3
  - texture object_6
  - texture object_7
  - stupendous object_1
  - next object_3 object_6
  - collect object_6 object_1
  - collect object_7 object_1
- Effects:
  - Add: next object_3 object_7
  - Delete: next object_3 object_6
- Plain English: With the same sneeze/source object_3 and swapped texture targets, change the pointer back from object_3→object_6 to object_3→object_7.

Step 5 — t = 40 s
Action: clip(object_13, object_3, object_7)
- Preconditions:
  - hand object_13
  - sneeze object_3
  - texture object_7
  - next object_3 object_7
  - next object_13 object_7
- Effects:
  - Add: vase object_13 object_3
  - Delete: next object_13 object_7
- Plain English: object_13 (hand) combines with sneeze-object object_3 at texture object_7 to create vase(object_13, object_3) and remove next(object_13, object_7).

Step 6 — t = 50 s
Action: tightfisted(object_11, object_3, object_7)
- Preconditions:
  - hand object_11
  - sneeze object_3
  - texture object_7
  - next object_3 object_7
  - vase object_11 object_3
- Effects:
  - Add: next object_11 object_7
  - Delete: vase object_11 object_3
- Plain English: Using object_11 (hand) and the existing vase(object_11, object_3) together with the pointer next(object_3, object_7), promote that relation so object_11 points to object_7 (next(object_11, object_7)) and remove the temporary vase object_11–object_3. (This produces the goal next(object_11, object_7).)

Step 7 — t = 60 s
Action: wretched(object_3, object_7, object_9, object_2)
- Preconditions:
  - sneeze object_3
  - texture object_7
  - texture object_9
  - stupendous object_2
  - next object_3 object_7
  - collect object_7 object_2
  - collect object_9 object_2
- Effects:
  - Add: next object_3 object_9
  - Delete: next object_3 object_7
- Plain English: Redirect the pointer from object_3→object_7 to object_3→object_9 (using collects tied to stupendous object_2 and textures).

Step 8 — t = 70 s
Action: tightfisted(object_13, object_3, object_9)
- Preconditions:
  - hand object_13
  - sneeze object_3
  - texture object_9
  - next object_3 object_9
  - vase object_13 object_3
- Effects:
  - Add: next object_13 object_9
  - Delete: vase object_13 object_3
- Plain English: Using object_13 (hand) and the vase created earlier, promote object_13 to point to object_9 (next(object_13, object_9)) and remove the vase object_13–object_3. (This produces the goal next(object_13, object_9).)

Step 9 — t = 80 s
Action: clip(object_12, object_4, object_10)
- Preconditions:
  - hand object_12
  - sneeze object_4
  - texture object_10
  - next object_4 object_10
  - next object_12 object_10
- Effects:
  - Add: vase object_12 object_4
  - Delete: next object_12 object_10
- Plain English: Create vase(object_12, object_4) anchored at texture object_10 and remove the link next(object_12, object_10) temporarily.

Step 10 — t = 90 s
Action: tightfisted(object_12, object_4, object_8)
- Preconditions:
  - hand object_12
  - sneeze object_4
  - texture object_8
  - next object_4 object_8
  - vase object_12 object_4
- Effects:
  - Add: next object_12 object_8
  - Delete: vase object_12 object_4
- Plain English: Promote object_12 to point to object_8 (next(object_12, object_8)) and remove the vase object_12–object_4. (This produces the goal next(object_12, object_8).)

Step 11 — t = 100 s
Action: wretched(object_5, object_11, object_10, object_3)
- Preconditions:
  - sneeze object_5
  - texture object_11
  - texture object_10
  - stupendous object_3
  - next object_5 object_11
  - collect object_11 object_3
  - collect object_10 object_3
- Effects:
  - Add: next object_5 object_10
  - Delete: next object_5 object_11
- Plain English: Redirect object_5’s pointer from object_11 to object_10 using the specified textures and collects, creating next(object_5, object_10).

Step 12 — t = 110 s
Action: tightfisted(object_12, object_5, object_10)
- Preconditions:
  - hand object_12
  - sneeze object_5
  - texture object_10
  - next object_5 object_10
  - vase object_12 object_5
- Effects:
  - Add: next object_12 object_10
  - Delete: vase object_12 object_5
- Plain English: Using object_12 (hand) and the previously created vase(object_12, object_5), promote object_12 to point to object_10 (next(object_12, object_10)) and remove the vase. (This re-establishes next(object_12, object_10), fulfilling that goal.)

Summary and compliance
- All 12 actions in the original plan are reproduced exactly and processed in sequence with timestamps (0 s → 110 s, 10 s increments). No actions were added or removed.
- Each step lists the grounded preconditions and effects derived from the domain specification for the corresponding schema (clip, wretched, tightfisted).
- The plan is temporally and causally consistent under the domain model: every precondition used by an action is satisfied by initial facts or by effects of earlier actions in the trace.
- Final goals achieved (explicitly produced by the steps above):
  - next object_11 object_7 (produced at Step 6)
  - next object_12 object_8 (produced at Step 10)
  - next object_12 object_10 (produced at Step 12)
  - next object_13 object_9 (produced at Step 8)
- Reported plan cost (from the original plan): 12 (unit cost).

If you want, I can also produce a compact table of predicate-state changes over time (showing the state of relevant next/ vase facts before and after each step) to further illustrate how the goals are reached.
