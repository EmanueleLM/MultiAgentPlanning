Below is a clear, step-by-step, human-readable trace of the given plan. Each step corresponds exactly to one action in the provided plan, lists the input objects (and their relevant unary properties from the problem init), states the time/stage transition (from -> to), and describes the primary preconditions and effects in plain language. Each action advances the global time marker by one stage (one time unit). Total cost = 11 (one unit per action).

1) Time 0 → 1 (s0 -> s1): memory object_0 object_9 object_6
- Objects: object_0 (cats), object_9 (spring, texture, collect with object_3), object_6 (spring, texture, collect with object_2)
- Preconditions used: now s0; succ s0 s1; object_0 is cats; object_9 and object_6 are spring; next(object_0, object_9) holds.
- Effect (plain): Move the “next” pointer of object_0 from object_9 to object_6. (next object_0 object_9 is removed; next object_0 object_6 is added). Time advances to s1.

2) Time 1 → 2 (s1 -> s2): wretched object_4 object_8 object_7 object_2
- Objects: object_4 (sneeze, initially next->object_8), object_8 (texture, collect->object_2), object_7 (texture, collect->object_2), object_2 (stupendous)
- Preconditions used: now s1; succ s1 s2; next(object_4, object_8); collect(object_8, object_2); collect(object_7, object_2).
- Effect: Move the “next” pointer of object_4 from object_8 to object_7. (next object_4 object_8 removed; next object_4 object_7 added). Time advances to s2.

3) Time 2 → 3 (s2 -> s3): clip object_13 object_4 object_7
- Objects: object_13 (hand, initially next->object_7), object_4 (sneeze, next->object_7), object_7 (texture)
- Preconditions used: now s2; succ s2 s3; hand(object_13); sneeze(object_4); texture(object_7); next(object_4, object_7); next(object_13, object_7).
- Effect: Establish vase(object_13, object_4) and remove next(object_13, object_7). (object_13 loses its next to object_7 and gains vase with object_4). Time advances to s3.

4) Time 3 → 4 (s3 -> s4): wretched object_4 object_7 object_6 object_2
- Objects: object_4 (sneeze, next->object_7), object_7 (texture, collect->object_2), object_6 (texture, spring, collect->object_2), object_2 (stupendous)
- Preconditions used: now s3; succ s3 s4; next(object_4, object_7); collect(object_7, object_2); collect(object_6, object_2).
- Effect: Move next(object_4, ·) from object_7 to object_6. (next object_4 object_7 removed; next object_4 object_6 added). Time advances to s4.

5) Time 4 → 5 (s4 -> s5): tightfisted object_13 object_4 object_6
- Objects: object_13 (hand, currently has vase(object_13, object_4)), object_4 (sneeze, next->object_6), object_6 (texture)
- Preconditions used: now s4; succ s4 s5; hand(object_13); sneeze(object_4); texture(object_6); next(object_4, object_6); vase(object_13, object_4).
- Effect: Make next(object_13, object_6) and remove vase(object_13, object_4). (object_13 now points to object_6; its vase relation to object_4 is cleared). Time advances to s5.

6) Time 5 → 6 (s5 -> s6): sip object_13 object_0 object_6
- Objects: object_13 (hand, next->object_6), object_0 (cats), object_6 (texture, spring)
- Preconditions used: now s5; succ s5 s6; hand(object_13); cats(object_0); texture(object_6); next(object_13, object_6); next(object_0, object_6).
- Effect: Create vase(object_13, object_0) and remove next(object_13, object_6). (object_13 stops pointing to object_6 and gains vase to object_0). Time advances to s6.

7) Time 6 → 7 (s6 -> s7): memory object_0 object_6 object_9
- Objects: object_0 (cats), object_6 (spring), object_9 (spring)
- Preconditions used: now s6; succ s6 s7; cats(object_0); spring(object_6); spring(object_9); next(object_0, object_6).
- Effect: Move next(object_0) from object_6 back to object_9. (next object_0 object_6 removed; next object_0 object_9 added). Time advances to s7.

8) Time 7 → 8 (s7 -> s8): paltry object_13 object_0 object_9
- Objects: object_13 (hand, currently has vase(object_13, object_0)), object_0 (cats, next->object_9), object_9 (texture, spring)
- Preconditions used: now s7; succ s7 s8; hand(object_13); cats(object_0); texture(object_9); vase(object_13, object_0); next(object_0, object_9).
- Effect: Create next(object_13, object_9) and remove vase(object_13, object_0). (object_13 now points to object_9). Time advances to s8.
- Note: This step achieves goal condition next object_13 object_9.

9) Time 8 → 9 (s8 -> s9): clip object_12 object_5 object_11
- Objects: object_12 (hand, initially next->object_11), object_5 (sneeze, next->object_11), object_11 (texture)
- Preconditions used: now s8; succ s8 s9; hand(object_12); sneeze(object_5); texture(object_11); next(object_5, object_11); next(object_12, object_11).
- Effect: Create vase(object_12, object_5) and remove next(object_12, object_11). (object_12 loses its next to object_11 and gets vase to object_5). Time advances to s9.

10) Time 9 → 10 (s9 -> s10): wretched object_5 object_11 object_10 object_3
- Objects: object_5 (sneeze, next->object_11 initially then modified by clip step), object_11 (texture, collect->object_3), object_10 (texture, collect->object_3), object_3 (stupendous)
- Preconditions used: now s9; succ s9 s10; next(object_5, object_11); collect(object_11, object_3); collect(object_10, object_3); sneeze(object_5); texture(object_11); texture(object_10); stupendous(object_3).
- Effect: Move next(object_5) from object_11 to object_10. (next object_5 object_11 removed; next object_5 object_10 added). Time advances to s10.

11) Time 10 → 11 (s10 -> s11): tightfisted object_12 object_5 object_10
- Objects: object_12 (hand, currently vase(object_12, object_5)), object_5 (sneeze, next->object_10), object_10 (texture)
- Preconditions used: now s10; succ s10 s11; hand(object_12); sneeze(object_5); texture(object_10); next(object_5, object_10); vase(object_12, object_5).
- Effect: Create next(object_12, object_10) and remove vase(object_12, object_5). (object_12 now points to object_10). Time advances to s11.
- Note: This step achieves goal condition next object_12 object_10.

Final state summary (after Time 11 / now s11):
- Goal predicates satisfied:
  - next(object_12, object_10) — created in step 11
  - next(object_13, object_9) — created in step 8
- All steps executed exactly as in the provided plan; every action advanced the unique now marker by one stage (s0→s11) and each step took one time unit. Total cost = 11.
