Goal to achieve:
- next(object_11, object_5)
- next(object_12, object_9)
- next(object_13, object_10)

The plan executes 26 actions. Each action advances the global stage from stage_N to stage_N+1; I show that as a timestamp "stage_N -> stage_N+1". For each step I give: action name, parameters, a short plain-language description, and the main effects on predicates (what next(...) or vase(...) facts are created or removed).

Step 1 — (stage_0 -> stage_1)
Action: memory(object_0, object_8, object_5)
- Meaning: Move the "next" pointer for object_0 from object_8 to object_5.
- Effects: remove next(object_0, object_8); add next(object_0, object_5).

Step 2 — (stage_1 -> stage_2)
Action: wretched(object_3, object_6, object_7, object_1)
- Meaning: For sneeze-object_3, redirect its next from object_6 to object_7 (requires collects with object_1).
- Effects: remove next(object_3, object_6); add next(object_3, object_7).

Step 3 — (stage_2 -> stage_3)
Action: clip(object_12, object_3, object_7)
- Meaning: For hand object_12 and sneeze object_3, create a vase(object_12,object_3) and consume the next(object_12,object_7) link.
- Effects: remove next(object_12, object_7); add vase(object_12, object_3).

Step 4 — (stage_3 -> stage_4)
Action: clip(object_13, object_3, object_7)
- Meaning: As above but for object_13: create vase(object_13,object_3) and remove next(object_13,object_7).
- Effects: remove next(object_13, object_7); add vase(object_13, object_3).

Step 5 — (stage_4 -> stage_5)
Action: wretched(object_3, object_7, object_5, object_1)
- Meaning: Redirect next for sneeze object_3 from object_7 to object_5 (requires the proper collect facts).
- Effects: remove next(object_3, object_7); add next(object_3, object_5).

Step 6 — (stage_5 -> stage_6)
Action: tightfisted(object_12, object_3, object_5)

Step 7 — (stage_6 -> stage_7)
Action: sip(object_12, object_0, object_5)

- Effects: remove next(object_12, object_5); add vase(object_12, object_0).

Step 8 — (stage_7 -> stage_8)
Action: tightfisted(object_13, object_3, object_5)
- Meaning: Convert vase(object_13,object_3) into next(object_13,object_5).

Step 10 — (stage_9 -> stage_10)
Action: memory(object_0, object_5, object_8)
- Meaning: Move the "next" pointer for object_0 from object_5 back to object_8.
- Effects: remove next(object_0, object_5); add next(object_0, object_8).

Step 11 — (stage_10 -> stage_11)
Action: paltry(object_12, object_0, object_8)

Step 13 — (stage_12 -> stage_13)

- Note: This achieves required goal fact next(object_11, object_5).

Step 25 — (stage_24 -> stage_25)
Action: wretched(object_4, object_8, object_9, object_2)

Outcome after step 26

- next(object_12, object_9) — achieved at step 26
- next(object_13, object_10) — achieved at step 19

All 26 actions from the supplied plan are listed in order; each step advances the stage by one (stage_i -> stage_i+1) and the described predicate changes match the action schemas in the domain. The final goal triple is satisfied.
