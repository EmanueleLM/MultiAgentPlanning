Below is a human-readable, step-by-step execution of the given plan. Each step corresponds exactly to one action in the provided plan (same action name and arguments) and uses the stage indices as timestamps. Each action is listed with:
- step number,
- timestamp (stage start -> next stage),
- duration (1 time unit),
- the action with its object arguments,
- the action's required preconditions (from the public templates) and where they came from (initial facts or produced earlier),
- the immediate effects applied (adds/removes).
