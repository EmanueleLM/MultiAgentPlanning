Summary: Follow the given plan exactly. Each step uses actor_a. I assign each action a 1.0 time-unit duration and consecutive timestamps for readability. For each step I list the action, parameters, required preconditions (and whether they are present initially or produced earlier), and the immediate effects. Final goal check is included.

Initial facts used (from the problem's :init):
- cats(object_0)
- hand(object_7), hand(object_8)
- texture(object_5), texture(object_6)
- spring(object_5), spring(object_6)
- next(object_0, object_6), next(object_3, object_5), next(object_4, object_6), next(object_7, object_6), next(object_8, object_6)
- collect(object_5, object_1), collect(object_6, object_2)
- sneeze(object_3), sneeze(object_4)
- stupendous(object_1), stupendous(object_2)

Plan steps (timestamps and verification)

Step 1 — t = 0.0 → 1.0 (duration 1.0)
- Action: actor_a performs sip(object_8, object_0, object_6)
- Schema preconditions for sip(x,y,z): (hand x), (cats y), (texture z), (next x z), (next y z)
- Preconditions checked:
  - hand(object_8) — present in initial facts
  - cats(object_0) — present in initial facts
  - texture(object_6) — present in initial facts
  - next(object_8, object_6) — present in initial facts
  - next(object_0, object_6) — present in initial facts
- All preconditions satisfied.
- Effects (applied immediately at end of step):
  - Add: vase(object_8, object_0)
  - Delete: next(object_8, object_6)

Step 2 — t = 1.0 → 2.0 (duration 1.0)
- Action: actor_a performs sip(object_7, object_0, object_6)
- Preconditions needed (sip):
  - hand(object_7) — present in initial facts
  - cats(object_0) — present in initial facts
  - texture(object_6) — present in initial facts
  - next(object_7, object_6) — present in initial facts
  - next(object_0, object_6) — still present (not deleted by Step 1)
- All preconditions satisfied.
- Effects:
  - Add: vase(object_7, object_0)
  - Delete: next(object_7, object_6)

Step 3 — t = 2.0 → 3.0 (duration 1.0)
- Action: actor_a performs memory(object_0, object_6, object_5)
- Schema preconditions for memory(x,y,z): (cats x), (spring y), (spring z), (next x y)
- Preconditions checked:
  - cats(object_0) — present in initial facts
  - spring(object_6) — present in initial facts
  - spring(object_5) — present in initial facts
  - next(object_0, object_6) — present in initial facts and not deleted by prior steps (both Step 1 and Step 2 deleted next for object_8 and object_7 respectively, but not next(object_0, object_6))
- All preconditions satisfied.
- Effects:
  - Add: next(object_0, object_5)
  - Delete: next(object_0, object_6)

Step 4 — t = 3.0 → 4.0 (duration 1.0)
- Action: actor_a performs paltry(object_8, object_0, object_5)
- Schema preconditions for paltry(x,y,z): (hand x), (cats y), (texture z), (vase x y), (next y z)
- Preconditions checked:
  - hand(object_8) — initial fact (still true)
  - cats(object_0) — initial fact
  - texture(object_5) — initial fact
  - vase(object_8, object_0) — added by Step 1
  - next(object_0, object_5) — added by Step 3
- All preconditions satisfied.
- Effects:
  - Add: next(object_8, object_5)
  - Delete: vase(object_8, object_0)

Step 5 — t = 4.0 → 5.0 (duration 1.0)
- Action: actor_a performs paltry(object_7, object_0, object_5)
- Preconditions (paltry):
  - hand(object_7) — initial fact
  - cats(object_0) — initial fact
  - texture(object_5) — initial fact
  - vase(object_7, object_0) — added by Step 2
  - next(object_0, object_5) — added by Step 3 (still present)
- All preconditions satisfied.
- Effects:
  - Add: next(object_7, object_5)
  - Delete: vase(object_7, object_0)

Final state relevant facts (after all steps)
- next(object_8, object_5) — added in Step 4
- next(object_7, object_5) — added in Step 5
- The goal required:
  - next(object_7, object_5)
  - next(object_8, object_5)
- Both goal facts are true in the final state.

Conclusion: The five-step sequence exactly matches the given plan, all preconditions are present at the times they are required (either from the initial facts or from earlier steps), and the plan achieves the final goal by t = 5.0.
