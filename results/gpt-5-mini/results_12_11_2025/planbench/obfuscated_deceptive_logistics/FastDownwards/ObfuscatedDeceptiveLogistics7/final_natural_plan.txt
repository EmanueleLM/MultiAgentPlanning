Summary of initial state (time = stage_0)
- current_stage: stage_0
- hand: object_10
- cats: object_0, object_1
- sneeze: object_4, object_5
- spring: object_6, object_8
- stupendous: object_2, object_3
- texture: object_6, object_7, object_8, object_9
- collect: (object_6 object_2), (object_7 object_2), (object_8 object_3), (object_9 object_3)
- next relations:
  - next(object_0, object_8)
  - next(object_1, object_6)
  - next(object_10, object_9)
  - next(object_4, object_6)
  - next(object_5, object_9)

All actions take one stage step (treated here as 1 time unit). Stages map to timestamps: stage_0 → t=0, stage_1 → t=1, ..., stage_6 → t=6.

Execution trace (follow plan exactly)

Step 1 — t=0 → t=1

- Resulting relevant changes after t=2:
  - next(object_5, object_8) present
  - next(object_5, object_9) removed

Step 3 — t=2 → t=3
Action: tightfisted(object_10, object_5, object_8)
- Preconditions checked at t=2 (all satisfied):
  - hand(object_10) ✓
  - sneeze(object_5) ✓
  - texture(object_8) ✓
  - next(object_5, object_8) ✓
  - vase(object_10, object_5) ✓ (created in Step 1)
  - current_stage = stage_2 and succ(stage_2, stage_3) ✓
- Effects applied:
  - Added: next(object_10, object_8)
  - Deleted: vase(object_10, object_5)
  - Advance stage: current_stage = stage_3 (removed stage_2)
- Resulting relevant changes after t=3:
  - next(object_10, object_8) present
  - vase(object_10, object_5) removed

Step 4 — t=3 → t=4
Action: sip(object_10, object_0, object_8)
- Preconditions checked at t=3 (all satisfied):
  - hand(object_10) ✓
  - cats(object_0) ✓
  - texture(object_8) ✓
  - next(object_10, object_8) ✓ (created in Step 3)
  - next(object_0, object_8) ✓ (initial)
  - current_stage = stage_3 and succ(stage_3, stage_4) ✓
- Effects applied:
  - Added: vase(object_10, object_0)
  - Deleted: next(object_10, object_8)
  - Advance stage: current_stage = stage_4 (removed stage_3)
- Resulting relevant changes after t=4:
  - vase(object_10, object_0) present
  - next(object_10, object_8) removed

Step 5 — t=4 → t=5
Action: memory(object_0, object_8, object_6)
- Preconditions checked at t=4 (all satisfied):
  - cats(object_0) ✓
  - spring(object_8) ✓
  - spring(object_6) ✓
  - next(object_0, object_8) ✓ (still present)
  - current_stage = stage_4 and succ(stage_4, stage_5) ✓
- Effects applied:
  - Added: next(object_0, object_6)
  - Deleted: next(object_0, object_8)
  - Advance stage: current_stage = stage_5 (removed stage_4)
- Resulting relevant changes after t=5:
  - next(object_0, object_6) present
  - next(object_0, object_8) removed

Step 6 — t=5 → t=6
Action: paltry(object_10, object_0, object_6)
- Preconditions checked at t=5 (all satisfied):
  - hand(object_10) ✓
  - cats(object_0) ✓
  - texture(object_6) ✓
  - vase(object_10, object_0) ✓ (created in Step 4)
  - next(object_0, object_6) ✓ (created in Step 5)
  - current_stage = stage_5 and succ(stage_5, stage_6) ✓
- Effects applied:
  - Added: next(object_10, object_6)
  - Deleted: vase(object_10, object_0)
  - Advance stage: current_stage = stage_6 (removed stage_5)
- Resulting relevant changes after t=6:
  - next(object_10, object_6) present (this is the goal)
  - vase(object_10, object_0) removed

Goal check after final step (t=6)
- Goal: next(object_10, object_6)
- Status: satisfied (was added in Step 6)

Plan result: Success. Each action executed in order, all preconditions were satisfied at time of execution, and the final goal next(object_10, object_6) is achieved at t=6. Total time / cost: 6 time units (one per action).
