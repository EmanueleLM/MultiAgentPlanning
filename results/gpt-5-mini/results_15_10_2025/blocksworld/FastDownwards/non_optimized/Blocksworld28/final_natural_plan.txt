Plan to reach the final stacked goal (M on table, then L, K, J, I, H, G, F, E, D, C, B, A with A on top).
Assumption: each action takes 1.0s. Step N starts at timestamp (N-1)s.

19) t=18s, dur=1s — vowel_agent moves block A from the table onto block B.
20) t=19s, dur=1s — consonant_agent moves block D from on E to the table.
21) t=20s, dur=1s — vowel_agent moves block E from on F to the table.
22) t=21s, dur=1s — consonant_agent moves block F from on G to the table.
23) t=22s, dur=1s — vowel_agent moves block E from the table onto block F.
24) t=23s, dur=1s — consonant_agent moves block D from the table onto block E.
25) t=24s, dur=1s — vowel_agent moves block A from on B to the table.
26) t=25s, dur=1s — consonant_agent moves block B from on C to the table.
27) t=26s, dur=1s — vowel_agent moves block A from the table onto block B.
28) t=27s, dur=1s — consonant_agent moves block C from the table onto block D.
29) t=28s, dur=1s — vowel_agent moves block A from on B to the table.
30) t=29s, dur=1s — consonant_agent moves block B from the table onto block C.
31) t=30s, dur=1s — vowel_agent moves block A from the table onto block B.
32) t=31s, dur=1s — consonant_agent moves block G from on H to the table.
33) t=32s, dur=1s — consonant_agent moves block H from on I to the table.
34) t=33s, dur=1s — consonant_agent moves block G from the table onto block H.
35) t=34s, dur=1s — vowel_agent moves block I from on J to the table.
36) t=35s, dur=1s — consonant_agent moves block J from the table onto block K.
37) t=36s, dur=1s — vowel_agent moves block I from the table onto block J.
38) t=37s, dur=1s — consonant_agent moves block G from on H to the table.
39) t=38s, dur=1s — consonant_agent moves block H from the table onto block I.
40) t=39s, dur=1s — consonant_agent moves block G from the table onto block H.
41) t=40s, dur=1s — vowel_agent moves block A from on B to the table.
42) t=41s, dur=1s — consonant_agent moves block B from on C to the table.
43) t=42s, dur=1s — vowel_agent moves block A from the table onto block B.
44) t=43s, dur=1s — consonant_agent moves block C from on D to the table.
45) t=44s, dur=1s — consonant_agent moves block D from on E to the table.
46) t=45s, dur=1s — vowel_agent moves block E from on F to the table.
47) t=46s, dur=1s — consonant_agent moves block F from on G onto block G? (move from table to G)
    — interpretation: consonant_agent moves F from the table onto block G.
48) t=47s, dur=1s — vowel_agent moves block E from the table onto block F.
49) t=48s, dur=1s — consonant_agent moves block D from the table onto block E.
50) t=49s, dur=1s — consonant_agent moves block C from the table onto block D.
51) t=50s, dur=1s — vowel_agent moves block A from on B to the table.
52) t=51s, dur=1s — consonant_agent moves block B from the table onto block C.
53) t=52s, dur=1s — vowel_agent moves block A from the table onto block B.

End state (after step 53): the blocks are arranged into the single stack required:
M on table, then L, K, J, I, H, G, F, E, D, C, B, A with A on top.
