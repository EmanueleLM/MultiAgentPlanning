1) [t=0.0s → 5.0s] vowel_agent picks block A from the table.
   - Action corresponds to: (vowel-pick-from-table vowel_agent a)
   - Preconditions satisfied: A is on the table, A is clear, vowel_agent's hand is empty.
   - Result: vowel_agent is holding A; A is no longer on the table and is not clear.

2) [t=5.0s → 10.0s] consonant_agent picks block B from the table.
   - Action corresponds to: (consonant-pick-from-table consonant_agent b)
   - Preconditions satisfied: B is on the table, B is clear, consonant_agent's hand is empty.
   - Result: consonant_agent is holding B; B is no longer on the table and is not clear.

3) [t=10.0s → 15.0s] consonant_agent places block B onto block C.
   - Action corresponds to: (consonant-place-on consonant_agent b c)
   - Preconditions satisfied: consonant_agent is holding B and C is clear.
   - Result: B is now on C; B is clear; consonant_agent's hand is empty; C is no longer clear.

4) [t=15.0s → 20.0s] vowel_agent places block A onto block B.
   - Action corresponds to: (vowel-place-on vowel_agent a b)
   - Preconditions satisfied: vowel_agent is holding A and B is clear (after step 3 B became clear on top of C).
   - Result: A is now on B; A is clear; vowel_agent's hand is empty; B is no longer clear.

Final status: A on B on C on D on E on F on G on H on I on J, with J on the table — the specified goal configuration has been achieved.
