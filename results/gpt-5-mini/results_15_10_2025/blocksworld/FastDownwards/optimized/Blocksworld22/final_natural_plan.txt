Step 1 (t = 0s → 1s) — consonant_agent:
- Move block B from on top of G to the table.
  (Action: move-consonant-from-block-to-table B G)

Step 2 (t = 1s → 2s) — consonant_agent:
- Move block F from on top of H to on top of B.
  (Action: move-consonant-from-block-to-block F H B)

Step 3 (t = 2s → 3s) — consonant_agent:
- Move block G from on top of I to on top of D.
  (Action: move-consonant-from-block-to-block G I D)

Step 4 (t = 3s → 4s) — vowel_agent:
- Move block I from on top of J to on top of E.
  (Action: move-vowel-from-block-to-block I J E)

Step 5 (t = 4s → 5s) — consonant_agent:
- Move block J from on top of A to the table.
  (Action: move-consonant-from-block-to-table J A)

Step 6 (t = 5s → 6s) — vowel_agent:
- Move block I from on top of E to on top of J.
  (Action: move-vowel-from-block-to-block I E J)

Step 7 (t = 6s → 7s) — consonant_agent:
- Move block H from the table to on top of I.
  (Action: move-consonant-from-table-to-block H I)

Step 8 (t = 7s → 8s) — consonant_agent:
- Move block G from on top of D to on top of H.
  (Action: move-consonant-from-block-to-block G D H)

Step 9 (t = 8s → 9s) — consonant_agent:
- Move block F from on top of B to on top of G.
  (Action: move-consonant-from-block-to-block F B G)

Step 10 (t = 9s → 10s) — vowel_agent:
- Move block E from the table to on top of F.
  (Action: move-vowel-from-table-to-block E F)

Step 11 (t = 10s → 11s) — consonant_agent:
- Move block D from on top of C to on top of E.
  (Action: move-consonant-from-block-to-block D C E)

Step 12 (t = 11s → 12s) — consonant_agent:
- Move block C from the table to on top of D.
  (Action: move-consonant-from-table-to-block C D)

Step 13 (t = 12s → 13s) — consonant_agent:
- Move block B from the table to on top of C.
  (Action: move-consonant-from-table-to-block B C)

Step 14 (t = 13s → 14s) — vowel_agent:
- Move block A from the table to on top of B.
  (Action: move-vowel-from-table-to-block A B)

Result (after t = 14s):
- Final stack from top to bottom: A on B on C on D on E on F on G on H on I on J, with J on the table.
- Goal achieved. (Total actions: 14, unit cost per action → cost = 14)
