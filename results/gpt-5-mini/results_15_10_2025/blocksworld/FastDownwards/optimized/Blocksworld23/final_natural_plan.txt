Summary: the following 14 actions (in the same order as the PDDL plan) are executed to achieve the target stack A on B on C on D on E on F on G on H on I on J (with J on the table). Each step lists the executing agent, the block moved, source and destination, and a timestamp (actions assumed to take 10s each for timestamps).

Step 1 — 00:00:00 (duration 10s)
- Agent: consonant_agent
- Action: Move block F from on top of block C to on top of block D.
- PDDL step: (consonant_agent-move_block_block f c d)

Step 2 — 00:00:10 (duration 10s)
- Agent: consonant_agent
- Action: Move block C from on top of block J to the table.
- PDDL step: (consonant_agent-move_block_table c j)

Step 3 — 00:00:20 (duration 10s)
- Agent: consonant_agent
- Action: Move block J from on top of block H to the table.
- PDDL step: (consonant_agent-move_block_table j h)

Step 4 — 00:00:30 (duration 10s)
- Agent: vowel_agent
- Action: Move block I from the table onto block J.
- PDDL step: (vowel_agent-move_table_block i j)

Step 5 — 00:00:40 (duration 10s)
- Agent: consonant_agent
- Action: Move block H from the table onto block I.
- PDDL step: (consonant_agent-move_table_block h i)

Step 6 — 00:00:50 (duration 10s)
- Agent: consonant_agent
- Action: Move block G from on top of block A to on top of block H.
- PDDL step: (consonant_agent-move_block_block g a h)

Step 7 — 00:01:00 (duration 10s)
- Agent: consonant_agent
- Action: Move block F from on top of block D to on top of block G.
- PDDL step: (consonant_agent-move_block_block f d g)

Step 8 — 00:01:10 (duration 10s)
- Agent: consonant_agent
- Action: Move block D from on top of block B to on top of block A.
- PDDL step: (consonant_agent-move_block_block d b a)

Step 9 — 00:01:20 (duration 10s)
- Agent: consonant_agent
- Action: Move block B from on top of block E to the table.
- PDDL step: (consonant_agent-move_block_table b e)

Step 10 — 00:01:30 (duration 10s)
- Agent: vowel_agent
- Action: Move block E from the table onto block F.
- PDDL step: (vowel_agent-move_table_block e f)

Step 11 — 00:01:40 (duration 10s)
- Agent: consonant_agent
- Action: Move block D from on top of block A to on top of block E.
- PDDL step: (consonant_agent-move_block_block d a e)

Step 12 — 00:01:50 (duration 10s)
- Agent: consonant_agent
- Action: Move block C from the table onto block D.
- PDDL step: (consonant_agent-move_table_block c d)

Step 13 — 00:02:00 (duration 10s)
- Agent: consonant_agent
- Action: Move block B from the table onto block C.
- PDDL step: (consonant_agent-move_table_block b c)

Step 14 — 00:02:10 (duration 10s)
- Agent: vowel_agent
- Action: Move block A from the table onto block B.
- PDDL step: (vowel_agent-move_table_block a b)

Result (after Step 14):
- Final stack (top-to-bottom): A on B on C on D on E on F on G on H on I on J, with J on the table.
- Goal satisfied.
