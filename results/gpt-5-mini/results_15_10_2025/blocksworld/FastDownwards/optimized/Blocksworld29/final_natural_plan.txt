Execution plan (14 steps). Each action duration: 1 time unit (timestamps shown as t = 0,1,...).

1) t=0 (duration 1): vowel_agent moves block A from on top of H to the table.  
2) t=1 (duration 1): consonant_agent moves block H from on top of E onto block A.  
3) t=2 (duration 1): vowel_agent moves block E from on top of C to the table.  
4) t=3 (duration 1): consonant_agent moves block C from on top of J to the table.  
5) t=4 (duration 1): vowel_agent moves block I from the table onto block J.  
6) t=5 (duration 1): consonant_agent moves block B from on top of G to the table.  
7) t=6 (duration 1): consonant_agent moves block H from on top of A onto block I.  
8) t=7 (duration 1): consonant_agent moves block G from on top of F onto block H.  
9) t=8 (duration 1): consonant_agent moves block F from on top of D onto block G.  
10) t=9 (duration 1): vowel_agent moves block E from the table onto block F.  
11) t=10 (duration 1): consonant_agent moves block D from the table onto block E.  
12) t=11 (duration 1): consonant_agent moves block C from the table onto block D.  
13) t=12 (duration 1): consonant_agent moves block B from the table onto block C.  
14) t=13 (duration 1): vowel_agent moves block A from the table onto block B.

Result: single stack top-to-bottom A on B on C on D on E on F on G on H on I on J, with J on the table.
