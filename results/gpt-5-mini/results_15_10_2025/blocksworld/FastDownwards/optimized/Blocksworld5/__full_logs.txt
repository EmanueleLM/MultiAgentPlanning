PROBLEM
------------------------------
Two agents are tasked with manipulating blocks arranged in stacks on a table, from one configuration to another. Each block is uniquely labelled by a letter. Both agents can only interact with blocks at the top of each stack, and only interact with one block at a time. Additionally, one agent can only interact with vowel blocks, and the other can only interact with consonant blocks. Initially there are blocks L, J, H, I, G, K, B, E, F, C, D, A. L is on the table, J is on the table, H is on top of L, I is on the table, G is on top of H, K is on top of J, B is on top of I, E is on top of B, F is on top of E, C is on top of K, D is on top of C, A is on top of G. The goal is to have A is on top of B, B is on top of C, C is on top of D, D is on top of E, E is on top of F, F is on top of G, G is on top of H, H is on top of I, I is on top of J, J is on top of K, K is on top of L, L is on the table.

PROBLEM
------------------------------
Two agents are tasked with manipulating blocks arranged in stacks on a table, from one configuration to another. Each block is uniquely labelled by a letter. Both agents can only interact with blocks at the top of each stack, and only interact with one block at a time. Additionally, one agent can only interact with vowel blocks, and the other can only interact with consonant blocks. Initially there are blocks M, C, B, G, E, N, J, L, F, I, K, D, A, H. M is on the table, C is on the table, B is on top of C, G is on top of B, E is on top of M, N is on top of E, J is on top of G, L is on top of N, F is on top of L, I is on top of J, K is on top of F, D is on top of I, A is on top of D, H is on top of A. The goal is to have A is on top of B, B is on top of C, C is on top of D, D is on top of E, E is on top of F, F is on top of G, G is on top of H, H is on top of I, I is on top of J, J is on top of K, K is on top of L, L is on top of M, M is on top of N, N is on the table.

Both agents can only interact with blocks at the top of each stack, and only interact with one block at a time. Additionally, one agent can only interact with vowel blocks, and the other can only interact with consonant blocks. Initially there are blocks M, C, B, G, E, N, J, L, F, I, K, D, A, H. M is on the table, C is on the table, B is on top of C, G is on top of B, E is on top of M, N is on top of E, J is on top of G, L is on top of N, F is on top of L, I is on top of J, K is on top of F, D is on top of I, A is on top of D, H is on top of A. The goal is to have A is on top of B, B is on top of C, C is on top of D, D is on top of E, E is on top of F, F is on top of G, G is on top of H, H is on top of I, I is on top of J, J is on top of K, K is on top of L, L is on top of M, M is on top of N, N is on the table.",

NATURAL-PLAN sas_plan_0
------------------------------
1) [t=0.0s → 5.0s] vowel_agent picks block A from the table.
   - Action corresponds to: (vowel-pick-from-table vowel_agent a)
   - Preconditions satisfied: A is on the table, A is clear, vowel_agent's hand is empty.
   - Result: vowel_agent is holding A; A is no longer on the table and is not clear.

2) [t=5.0s → 10.0s] consonant_agent picks block B from the table.
   - Action corresponds to: (consonant-pick-from-table consonant_agent b)
   - Preconditions satisfied: B is on the table, B is clear, consonant_agent's hand is empty.
   - Result: consonant_agent is holding B; B is no longer on the table and is not clear.

3) [t=10.0s → 15.0s] consonant_agent places block B onto block C.
   - Action corresponds to: (consonant-place-on consonant_agent b c)
   - Preconditions satisfied: consonant_agent is holding B and C is clear.
   - Result: B is now on C; B is clear; consonant_agent's hand is empty; C is no longer clear.

4) [t=15.0s → 20.0s] vowel_agent places block A onto block B.
   - Action corresponds to: (vowel-place-on vowel_agent a b)
   - Preconditions satisfied: vowel_agent is holding A and B is clear (after step 3 B became clear on top of C).
   - Result: A is now on B; A is clear; vowel_agent's hand is empty; B is no longer clear.

Final status: A on B on C on D on E on F on G on H on I on J, with J on the table — the specified goal configuration has been achieved.

PROBLEM
------------------------------
Two agents are tasked with manipulating blocks arranged in stacks on a table, from one configuration to another. Each block is uniquely labelled by a letter. Both agents can only interact with blocks at the top of each stack, and only interact with one block at a time. Additionally, one agent can only interact with vowel blocks, and the other can only interact with consonant blocks. Initially there are blocks L, F, K, C, G, H, D, B, J, E, I, A. L is on the table, F is on top of L, K is on the table, C is on top of F, G is on the table, H is on top of K, D is on top of H, B is on top of D, J is on top of B, E is on top of J, I is on the table, A is on top of I. The goal is to have A is on top of B, B is on top of C, C is on top of D, D is on top of E, E is on top of F, F is on top of G, G is on top of H, H is on top of I, I is on top of J, J is on top of K, K is on top of L, L is on the table.

Ambiguities may appear in different forms for example two PDDL problems may refer to the same object with different names. Here is the information the first agent has and its PDDL response: {pddl_vowel_agent} Here is the information the second agent has and its PDDL response: {pddl_consonant_agent} You need to integrate the PDDL responses of the two agents to solve the task. It is important that you keep the actions of the two agents distinct. Think step by step and provide a combined PDDL domain and a PDDL problem file suitable for FastDownwards. Enclose the PDDL domain between <domain></domain> tags and the PDDL problem between <problem></problem> tags."

NATURAL-PLAN sas_plan_2
------------------------------
Step 1 (time 0 → 1, duration = 1 unit, cost = 1):
- Action: vowel_agent executes vowel-move A from table to B.
- Natural description: The vowel agent picks up block A (a vowel) from the table and places it on top of block B.
- PDDL action form: (vowel-move A table B)

Resulting immediate effects:
- A is no longer on the table and now is on B.
- The table becomes clear (if nothing else was on that table position).
- B is no longer clear (it now has A on top).

Goal check after Step 1:
- All goal predicates hold:
  - A on B (achieved by this action)
  - B on C
  - C on D
  - D on E
  - E on F
  - F on G
  - G on H
  - H on I
  - I on J
  - J on table

The single planned action completes the task.
================================================================================


PROBLEM
------------------------------
Two agents are tasked with manipulating blocks arranged in stacks on a table, from one configuration to another. Each block is uniquely labelled by a letter. Both agents can only interact with blocks at the top of each stack, and only interact with one block at a time. Additionally, one agent can only interact with vowel blocks, and the other can only interact with consonant blocks. Initially there are blocks C, B, I, F, D, A, E, G, H, J. C is on the table, B is on the table, I is on top of C, F is on top of I, D is on top of B, A is on top of D, E is on top of A, G is on top of E, H is on top of G, J is on top of F. The goal is to have A is on top of B, B is on top of C, C is on top of D, D is on top of E, E is on top of F, F is on top of G, G is on top of H, H is on top of I, I is on top of J, J is on the table.

NATURAL-PLAN sas_plan_1
------------------------------
Plan (total cost = 2; each action cost = 1, assumed duration = 1 time unit)

1) Time 0.0 → 1.0 (duration 1)
   Action: vowel_agent — pick-vowel-from-table A
   - Description: The vowel agent picks up block A from the table.
   - Preconditions satisfied: A is on the table and clear; vowel agent's hand is free.
   - Effects: A is no longer on the table; vowel agent is now holding A (hand is not free).

2) Time 1.0 → 2.0 (duration 1)
   Action: vowel_agent — put-vowel-on A B
   - Description: The vowel agent places block A onto block B.
   - Preconditions satisfied: vowel agent is holding A; B is clear.
   - Effects: A is on B; A becomes clear; B is no longer clear; vowel agent's hand becomes free.

Result after step 2:
- Goal achieved: A on B, B on C, C on D, D on E, and E on the table.
- Constraints respected: only the vowel agent manipulated a vowel block (A); only top blocks were moved; actions and costs match the provided plan.
================================================================================


PROBLEM
------------------------------
Two agents are tasked with manipulating blocks arranged in stacks on a table, from one configuration to another. Each block is uniquely labelled by a letter. Both agents can only interact with blocks at the top of each stack, and only interact with one block at a time. Additionally, one agent can only interact with vowel blocks, and the other can only interact with consonant blocks. Initially there are blocks D, A, K, J, C, F, G, I, E, H, B. D is on the table, A is on the table, K is on top of D, J is on the table, C is on top of J, F is on top of C, G is on top of F, I is on the table, E is on top of I, H is on top of K, B is on top of A. The goal is to have A is on top of B, B is on top of C, C is on top of D, D is on top of E, E is on top of F, F is on top of G, G is on top of H, H is on top of I, I is on top of J, J is on top of K, K is on the table.

Both agents can only interact with blocks at the top of each stack, and only interact with one block at a time. Additionally, one agent can only interact with vowel blocks, and the other can only interact with consonant blocks. Initially there are blocks D, A, K, J, C, F, G, I, E, H, B. D is on the table, A is on the table, K is on top of D, J is on the table, C is on top of J, F is on top of C, G is on top of F, I is on the table, E is on top of I, H is on top of K, B is on top of A.

NATURAL-PLAN sas_plan_1
------------------------------
Step 1 — t = 0 → 1 (duration: 1 time unit, cost = 1)
- Agent: vowel_agent
- Action: Move block A from the table onto block B.
- Description: vowel_agent picks up vowel block A (which is on the table and clear) and places it on top of block B (which is clear).
- Resulting state (relevant facts): A is on B; A is no longer on the table; B is no longer clear.

Outcome: After this single action the goal is achieved: the stack A on B on C on D on E on F on G on H on I on J with J on the table.
================================================================================


PROBLEM
------------------------------
Two agents are tasked with manipulating blocks arranged in stacks on a table, from one configuration to another. Each block is uniquely labelled by a letter. Both agents can only interact with blocks at the top of each stack, and only interact with one block at a time. Additionally, one agent can only interact with vowel blocks, and the other can only interact with consonant blocks. Initially there are blocks I, B, L, A, F, H, D, G, C, E, K, J. I is on the table, B is on the table, L is on top of I, A is on top of B, F is on top of L, H is on top of A, D is on top of H, G is on top of F, C is on top of G, E is on top of D, K is on top of E, J is on the table. The goal is to have A is on top of B, B is on top of C, C is on top of D, D is on top of E, E is on top of F, F is on top of G, G is on top of H, H is on top of I, I is on top of J, J is on top of K, K is on top of L, L is on the table.
