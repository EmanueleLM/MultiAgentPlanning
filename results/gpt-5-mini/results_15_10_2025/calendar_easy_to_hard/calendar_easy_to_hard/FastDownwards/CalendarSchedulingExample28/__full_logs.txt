PROBLEM
------------------------------
You are an expert at scheduling meetings. You are given a few constraints on the existing schedule of each participant, the meeting duration, and possibly some preferences on the meeting time. Note there exists a solution that works with existing schedule of every participant. Here are a few example tasks and solutions:

TASK: You need to schedule a meeting for Peter, Judith, Keith and Evelyn for half an hour between the work hours of 9:00 to 17:00 on Monday. 

Here are the existing schedules for everyone during the day: 
Peter has meetings on Monday during 9:00 to 9:30, 10:30 to 11:00, 11:30 to 12:00, 12:30 to 13:00; 
Judith's calendar is wide open the entire day.
Keith has blocked their calendar on Monday during 11:30 to 12:00, 12:30 to 15:00, 15:30 to 16:00, 16:30 to 17:00; 
Evelyn is busy on Monday during 9:00 to 12:30, 13:30 to 15:30, 16:30 to 17:00; 

Find a time that works for everyone's schedule and constraints.

Use discrete 30-minute time slots matching the environment init time_granularity_minutes. Do not assume any availability information beyond what participants provided.

NATURAL-PLAN sas_plan_6
------------------------------
1) Propose timeslot ts15 — Orchestrator proposes a 30-minute meeting on Monday at 16:00–16:30 (ts15).

2) Confirm (evelyn, ts15) — Evelyn confirms she is available for 16:00–16:30 on Monday.

3) Finalize ts15 (using evelyn’s confirmation) — Orchestrator finalizes and schedules the meeting for Monday 16:00–16:30 (30 minutes, ts15) for all participants (peter, judith, keith, evelyn). The meeting is now scheduled and satisfies the goal of placing a single 30-minute meeting on Monday between 09:00 and 17:00.

PROBLEM
------------------------------
You are an expert at scheduling meetings. You are given a few constraints on the existing schedule of each participant, the meeting duration, and possibly some preferences on the meeting time. Note there exists a solution that works with existing schedule of every participant. Here are a few example tasks and solutions:

TASK: You need to schedule a meeting for Lawrence, Christine, Barbara, Stephanie and Hannah for half an hour between the work hours of 9:00 to 17:00 on Monday. 

Here are the existing schedules for everyone during the day: 
Lawrencehas no meetings the whole day.
Christine has meetings on Monday during 9:00 to 9:30, 12:30 to 13:00; 
Barbara is busy on Monday during 10:30 to 11:30, 12:00 to 12:30, 13:00 to 13:30, 14:00 to 14:30, 15:30 to 16:00; 
Stephanie has meetings on Monday during 10:00 to 11:00, 11:30 to 12:00, 12:30 to 13:30, 14:30 to 15:00, 15:30 to 16:00, 16:30 to 17:00; 
Hannah has blocked their calendar on Monday during 9:00 to 10:00, 10:30 to 12:00, 12:30 to 13:00, 14:00 to 15:30, 16:00 to 16:30; 

Find a time that works for everyone's schedule and constraints.

PROBLEM
------------------------------
You are an expert at scheduling meetings. You are given a few constraints on the existing schedule of each participant, the meeting duration, and possibly some preferences on the meeting time. Note there exists a solution that works with existing schedule of every participant. Here are a few example tasks and solutions:

TASK: You need to schedule a meeting for Walter, Danielle, Julia, Samuel and Lori for half an hour between the work hours of 9:00 to 17:00 on Monday. 

Here are the existing schedules for everyone during the day: 
Walter's calendar is wide open the entire day.
Danielle is free the entire day.
Julia has blocked their calendar on Monday during 9:30 to 10:00, 10:30 to 11:00, 13:30 to 14:00, 16:00 to 16:30; 
Samuel has meetings on Monday during 9:00 to 11:00, 11:30 to 12:30, 13:00 to 14:30, 15:00 to 15:30, 16:00 to 17:00; 
Lori is busy on Monday during 10:00 to 10:30, 11:00 to 11:30, 12:00 to 12:30, 13:00 to 14:30, 15:00 to 17:00; 

You would like to schedule the meeting at their earlist availability.
Find a time that works for everyone's schedule and constraints.

You are an expert at scheduling meetings. You are given a few constraints on the existing schedule of each participant, the meeting duration, and possibly some preferences on the meeting time. Note there exists a solution that works with existing schedule of every participant. Here are a few example tasks and solutions:

TASK: You need to schedule a meeting for Walter, Danielle, Julia, Samuel and Lori for half an hour between the work hours of 9:00 to 17:00 on Monday. 

Here are the existing schedules for everyone during the day: 
Walter's calendar is wide open the entire day.
Danielle is free the entire day.
Julia has blocked their calendar on Monday during 9:30 to 10:00, 10:30 to 11:00, 13:30 to 14:00, 16:00 to 16:30; 
Samuel has meetings on Monday during 9:00 to 11:00, 11:30 to 12:30, 13:00 to 14:30, 15:00 to 15:30, 16:00 to 17:00; 
Lori is busy on Monday during 10:00 to 10:30, 11:00 to 11:30, 12:00 to 12:30, 13:00 to 14:30, 15:00 to 17:00; 

You would like to schedule the meeting at their earlist availability.
Find a time that works for everyone's schedule and constraints.

PROBLEM
------------------------------
You are an expert at scheduling meetings. You are given a few constraints on the existing schedule of each participant, the meeting duration, and possibly some preferences on the meeting time. Note there exists a solution that works with existing schedule of every participant. Here are a few example tasks and solutions:

TASK: You need to schedule a meeting for Jesse, Nancy, Isabella, Harold and Linda for half an hour between the work hours of 9:00 to 17:00 on Monday. 

Here are the existing schedules for everyone during the day: 
Jesse is busy on Monday during 10:00 to 10:30, 15:00 to 15:30; 
Nancy has blocked their calendar on Monday during 9:00 to 9:30, 10:30 to 11:00, 13:30 to 14:00, 14:30 to 15:00; 
Isabella has meetings on Monday during 9:00 to 10:00, 11:30 to 12:00, 15:30 to 16:00; 
Harold has blocked their calendar on Monday during 9:00 to 10:00, 10:30 to 16:30; 
Linda has meetings on Monday during 9:00 to 10:00, 12:00 to 12:30, 13:30 to 16:00; 

Find a time that works for everyone's schedule and constraints.

NATURAL-PLAN sas_plan_1
------------------------------
Step 1 — Schedule meeting (slot s1630)
- Action: Schedule a 30-minute meeting on Monday at 16:30–17:00 (slot s1630).
- Attendees: Jesse, Nancy, Isabella, Harold, Linda.
- Duration: 30 minutes (16:30 to 17:00).
- Result: The meeting is scheduled for that slot and that slot is now reserved for all five required attendees (their s1630 availability is consumed).
