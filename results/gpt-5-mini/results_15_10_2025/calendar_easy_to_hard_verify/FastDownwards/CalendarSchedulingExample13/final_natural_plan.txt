Step 1 — schedule-meeting slot16
- Action: Schedule the 30-minute meeting (PDDL action: schedule-meeting slot16).
- Day & time: Monday, 16:30–17:00 (30 minutes).
- Participants: Diane, Jack, Eugene, Patricia.
- Reasoning / availability: In the problem encoding, slot16 corresponds to the final half-hour of the work day (16:30–17:00). The PDDL initial state marks slot16 as free for Diane, Jack, Eugene, and Patricia, so all four participants are available at this time.
- Outcome: Meeting scheduled for Monday 16:30–17:00 — goal (meeting-scheduled slot16) achieved.
