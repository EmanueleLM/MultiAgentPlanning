Step 1 — schedule-meeting (t12, t13)
- Action: Schedule a 60-minute meeting covering slots t12 and t13.
- Time: Monday, 14:30–15:30 (t12 = 14:30–15:00, t13 = 15:00–15:30)
- Participants: thomas, dylan, jerry
- Reason: These consecutive slots are within work hours (09:00–17:00) and are compatible with each participant's busy intervals (thomas: free all day; dylan: busy 10:30–11:00 and 13:30–14:00; jerry: busy until 14:30 and again 16:00–17:00), so everyone is available from 14:30–15:30.
