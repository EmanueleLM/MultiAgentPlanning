Summary of actions (matching the plan):

Time mapping used: t0 = 09:00. Each t increment = 1 minute. Therefore:
- t23 = 09:23
- t420 = 16:00
- t524 = 17:44
- t525 = 17:45

1) travel-ggp-chinatown t0 → t23
- Action: Depart Golden Gate Park at 09:00 and travel to Chinatown.
- Arrival: Chinatown at 09:23.
- Duration: 23 minutes (09:00 → 09:23).

2) wait-traveler chinatown t23 → t24, t24 → t25, ..., t523 → t524
- Action: Remain in Chinatown continuously from arrival at 09:23 through 17:44.
- Implementation: This is the sequence of minute-by-minute wait actions (wait-traveler chinatown t23 t24, then t24 t25, and so on up to wait-traveler chinatown t523 t524) as shown in the plan.
- Duration: 09:23 → 17:44 = 8 hours 21 minutes (501 consecutive one-minute waits).

3) start-meeting-420
- Action: Schedule (start) the meeting that runs from t420 to t525.
- Interpreted timestamp: meeting from 16:00 to 17:45.
- Duration: 105 minutes (16:00 → 17:45).
- Location and participants: Chinatown, traveler meeting David.
- Constraint check: David is available at Chinatown starting 16:00 and for the required contiguous 105 minutes; the meeting-scheduled fact (t420 t525) satisfies the goal.

Result: The traveler travels from Golden Gate Park to Chinatown at 09:00–09:23, remains in Chinatown all day until the meeting, and the 105-minute meeting with David is scheduled and satisfied from 16:00 to 17:45 (meeting-scheduled t420 t525), meeting the specification constraint.
