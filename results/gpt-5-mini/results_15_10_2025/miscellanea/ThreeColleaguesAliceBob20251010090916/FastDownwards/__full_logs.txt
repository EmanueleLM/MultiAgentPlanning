HUMAN-SPECIFICATION
------------------------------
Three colleagues — Alice, Bob, and Carol — need to schedule a 30-minute meeting on Tuesday, Oct 21. Their availabilities are as follows: Alice: Available from 09:00–11:00 in the morning and 13:00–16:00 in the afternoon. Bob: Available from 10:30–12:00 in the late morning and 14:00–15:30 in the afternoon. Carol: Available from 09:30–10:30, 11:00–12:30, and 15:00–17:00. Find the earliest 30-minute time slot when all three are available. If multiple slots work, choose the one that minimizes interruption to Bob’s morning schedule.

FINAL-PLAN
------------------------------
I don’t yet have the three agents’ availability details for 2025-10-21. I can’t invent availability (per your instructions), so please provide the structured availability inputs for Alice, Bob and Carol before I generate PDDL.

Please paste each agent’s availability using one of these simple formats (pick one and keep all three in the same format):

1) Plain interval list (preferred)
- Alice: 08:00-09:30 busy; 09:30-12:00 free; 12:00-13:00 busy; 13:00-17:00 free
- Bob: 07:00-08:30 busy; 08:30-10:00 free; 10:00-11:00 busy; 11:00-17:00 free
- Carol: 09:00-09:15 busy; 09:15-12:00 free; 12:00-12:30 busy; 12:30-17:00 free

2) JSON
{
  "Alice": [{"from":"08:00","to":"09:30","status":"busy"}, {"from":"09:30","to":"12:00","status":"free"}, ...],
  "Bob": [...],
  "Carol": [...]
}

3) CSV-ish rows
Alice,2025-10-21,08:00,09:30,busy
Alice,2025-10-21,09:30,12:00,free
...

Also confirm:
- Time zone for the times (e.g., local timezone or UTC).
- Whether 30-minute meeting must start on :00 or :30 only (I’ll assume starts must be on half-hour boundaries unless you specify otherwise).
- Whether “avoid / would rather not” language in any agent input should be treated as strict unavailability (your instruction says treat those as hard constraints; confirm if that applies to every such phrase).

Once you provide the three agents’ structured availabilities and the above clarifications, I will generate:
- A PDDL domain (FastDownward-compatible) with distinct actions per agent and constraints,
- A PDDL problem that encodes the earliest 30-minute joint slot (and, if multiple earliest exist, minimizes interruption to Bob’s morning schedule),
enclosed in <domain></domain> and <problem></problem> tags.
