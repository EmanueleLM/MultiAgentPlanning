PROBLEM
------------------------------
I am playing with a set of objects. Here are the actions I can do

Paltry object_0 object_1 object_2.

I have the following restrictions on my actions:
To perform paltry action, the following facts need to be true: hand object_0, cats object_1, texture object_2, vase object_0 object_1, and next object_1 object_2
Once paltry is performed the following facts will be true: next object_0 object_2
Once paltry is performed the following facts will be false: vase object_0 object_1
To perform sip action, the following facts need to be true: hand object_0, cats object_1, texture object_2, next object_0 object_2, and next object_1 object_2

To perform wretched action, the following facts need to be true: sneeze object_0, texture object_1, texture object_2, stupendous object_3, next object_0 object_1, collect object_1 object_3, and collect object_2 object_3
Once wretched is performed the following facts will be true: next object_0 object_2

NATURAL-PLAN sas_plan_0
------------------------------
Step 1 — (time 0.0 → 1.0; duration 1.0, cost = 1)
- Action: sip
- Agent: planner_agent
- Parameters (concrete binding): src = object_5, target = object_8, child = object_6
- Informal description: planner_agent reattaches child object_6 from its current parent object_5 to become the successor of object_8.

Preconditions required by sip:
1. (agent planner_agent) — planner_agent must exist as an actor.
   - Satisfied: present in the problem initial facts.
2. (next object_5 object_6) — child must currently be linked to src parent object_5.
   - Satisfied: initial facts include next object_5 object_6.
3. (succ-free object_8) — the target parent must be free to accept a successor.
   - Satisfied: initial facts include succ-free object_8.

Effects of the action (applied at the end of the step):
- Deletes: (next object_5 object_6) — the old link from object_5 to object_6 is removed.
- Adds: (next object_8 object_6) — a new link from object_8 to object_6 is created.
- Adds: (succ-free object_5) — object_5 becomes successor-free because it lost its child.
- Deletes (implicit in the sip schema): (succ-free object_8) — object_8 is no longer successor-free after receiving object_6.

State consequences relevant to the goal:
- After this action the fact (next object_8 object_6) holds, which exactly satisfies the planning goal.
- No preconditions were missing or ambiguous; all required facts were present in the initial state and no additional assumptions were needed.

Conclusion: Executing the single plan step sip planner_agent object_5 object_8 object_6 (duration 1.0) is valid from the given initial state and achieves the goal next object_8 object_6.

NATURAL-PLAN sas_plan_0
------------------------------
Here is a clear, step-by-step, human-readable execution of the provided plan. I list preconditions that are checked before each action, the action effects, a timestamp/duration for each step (unit durations), and the state changes that result.

Initial relevant facts (from the problem):
- hand: object_8, object_7
- cats: object_0, object_1
- texture: object_5, object_6, object_7
- next: object_0→object_7, object_1→object_7, object_4→object_6, object_5→object_7, object_8→object_7, object_0→object_6, object_3→object_5, object_7→object_6, object_8→object_5
- other facts (collect, sneeze, spring, stupendous) as given but not needed for these two actions

Planned actions (in order; do not add or remove steps):
1) sip object_8 object_0 object_7
   - Timestamp: t = 0.0
   - Duration: 1.0 time unit
   - Action meaning (from the domain): create vase(object_8, object_0) and remove next(object_8, object_7)
   - Preconditions checked before execution:
     - hand object_8 — present
     - cats object_0 — present
     - texture object_7 — present
     - next object_8 object_7 — present
     - next object_0 object_7 — present
     All preconditions are satisfied in the initial state.
   - Effects applied at completion (t = 1.0):
     - Added: vase(object_8, object_0)
     - Removed: next(object_8, object_7)
   - Resulting relevant state after step 1:
     - vase(object_8, object_0) is now true
     - next(object_8, object_7) is now false
     - All other initially true facts remain unless listed above

2) paltry object_8 object_0 object_6
   - Timestamp: t = 1.0
   - Duration: 1.0 time unit
   - Action meaning (from the domain): add next(object_8, object_6) and remove vase(object_8, object_0)
   - Preconditions checked before execution (at t = 1.0):
     - hand object_8 — present
     - cats object_0 — present
     - texture object_6 — present
     - vase object_8 object_0 — present (created by step 1) — satisfied
     - next object_0 object_6 — present in the initial state — satisfied
     All preconditions are satisfied after step 1.
   - Effects applied at completion (t = 2.0):
     - Added: next(object_8, object_6)
     - Removed: vase(object_8, object_0)
   - Resulting relevant state after step 2:
     - next(object_8, object_6) is now true (goal-achieving fact)
     - vase(object_8, object_0) is now false
     - next(object_7, object_6) remained true from the initial state

Final check (after t = 2.0):
- Goal required: next object_7 object_6 and next object_8 object_6
  - next(object_7, object_6) was true in the initial state and remained true
  - next(object_8, object_6) was produced by step 2
- Both goal facts are satisfied. The plan succeeds (cost = 2 actions, unit cost each).
