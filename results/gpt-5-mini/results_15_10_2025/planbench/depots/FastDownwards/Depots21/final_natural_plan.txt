Summary: executing the given plan step-by-step (each step duration 1 time unit). All preconditions are satisfied at each step; the plan produces the goal (next object_12 object_11).

Initial relevant facts (selected, from scenario A):
- hand: object_12
- sneeze: object_4, object_5
- texture: object_6, object_7, object_8, object_9, object_10, object_11
- stupendous: object_2, object_3
- collect: (object_10, object_3), (object_11, object_3), (object_6, object_2), (object_7, object_2), (object_8, object_2), (object_9, object_3)
- next: (object_0, object_6), (object_1, object_9), (object_12, object_10), (object_4, object_7), (object_5, object_9)
Goal: next(object_12, object_11)

Step-by-step execution (timestamps and state updates):

Step 1 — t = 0.0 to 1.0 (duration 1)
Action: wretched object_5 object_9 object_10 object_3
- Parameters: p=object_5, q=object_9, r=object_10, s=object_3
- Required preconditions (checked):
  - sneeze(object_5) — PRESENT
  - texture(object_9) — PRESENT
  - texture(object_10) — PRESENT
  - stupendous(object_3) — PRESENT
  - next(object_5, object_9) — PRESENT
  - collect(object_9, object_3) — PRESENT
  - collect(object_10, object_3) — PRESENT
  => All preconditions satisfied.
- Effects applied:
  - Add: next(object_5, object_10)
  - Delete: next(object_5, object_9)
- State change (relevant):
  - next: (object_5, object_9) removed, (object_5, object_10) added
  - Other predicates unaffected.

Step 2 — t = 1.0 to 2.0 (duration 1)
Action: clip object_12 object_5 object_10
- Parameters: x=object_12, y=object_5, z=object_10
- Required preconditions (checked):
  - hand(object_12) — PRESENT
  - sneeze(object_5) — PRESENT
  - texture(object_10) — PRESENT
  - next(object_5, object_10) — PRESENT (added in Step 1)
  - next(object_12, object_10) — PRESENT (initial state)
  => All preconditions satisfied.
- Effects applied:
  - Add: vase(object_12, object_5)
  - Delete: next(object_12, object_10)
- State change (relevant):
  - next: (object_12, object_10) removed
  - vase: (object_12, object_5) added

Step 3 — t = 2.0 to 3.0 (duration 1)
Action: wretched object_5 object_10 object_11 object_3
- Parameters: p=object_5, q=object_10, r=object_11, s=object_3
- Required preconditions (checked):
  - sneeze(object_5) — PRESENT
  - texture(object_10) — PRESENT
  - texture(object_11) — PRESENT
  - stupendous(object_3) — PRESENT
  - next(object_5, object_10) — PRESENT (from Step 1)
  - collect(object_10, object_3) — PRESENT
  - collect(object_11, object_3) — PRESENT
  => All preconditions satisfied.
- Effects applied:
  - Add: next(object_5, object_11)
  - Delete: next(object_5, object_10)
- State change (relevant):
  - next: (object_5, object_10) removed, (object_5, object_11) added

Step 4 — t = 3.0 to 4.0 (duration 1)
Action: tightfisted object_12 object_5 object_11
- Parameters: x=object_12, y=object_5, z=object_11
- Required preconditions (checked):
  - hand(object_12) — PRESENT
  - sneeze(object_5) — PRESENT
  - texture(object_11) — PRESENT
  - next(object_5, object_11) — PRESENT (added in Step 3)
  - vase(object_12, object_5) — PRESENT (added in Step 2)
  => All preconditions satisfied.
- Effects applied:
  - Add: next(object_12, object_11)
  - Delete: vase(object_12, object_5)
- State change (relevant):
  - next: (object_12, object_11) added — this achieves the goal
  - vase: (object_12, object_5) removed

Final result (after t = 4.0):
- Goal achieved: next(object_12, object_11) is PRESENT.
- All plan steps were applicable in sequence; no missing preconditions or conflicts were encountered.
- Plan length/cost: 4 actions (unit cost each) — total cost 4.

If you want, I can produce a compact table of only the required preconditions and produced/deleted facts per step, or produce a PDDL trace file with timestamps.
