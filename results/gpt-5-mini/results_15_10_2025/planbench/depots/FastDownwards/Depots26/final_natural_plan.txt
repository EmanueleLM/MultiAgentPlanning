Below is a clear, human-readable step-by-step execution of the provided PDDL plan. Each step lists the action, its parameters, the timestamp (1.0 time unit per action), the required preconditions (what must hold before the action), and the deterministic effects (what the action adds and what it deletes).

Step 1 (t = 0.0 → 1.0)
- Action: clip object_13 object_4 object_7
- Preconditions: hand(object_13), sneeze(object_4), texture(object_7), next(object_4, object_7), next(object_13, object_7)
- Effects: add vase(object_13, object_4); delete next(object_13, object_7)

Step 2 (t = 1.0 → 2.0)
- Action: clip object_12 object_4 object_7
- Preconditions: hand(object_12), sneeze(object_4), texture(object_7), next(object_4, object_7), next(object_12, object_7)
- Effects: add vase(object_12, object_4); delete next(object_12, object_7)

Step 3 (t = 2.0 → 3.0)

- Preconditions: sneeze(object_4), texture(object_8), texture(object_10), stupendous(object_2), next(object_4, object_8), collect(object_8, object_2), collect(object_10, object_2)
- Effects: add next(object_4, object_10); delete next(object_4, object_8)

Step 6 (t = 5.0 → 6.0)

- Preconditions: hand(object_13), sneeze(object_4), texture(object_10), next(object_4, object_10), vase(object_13, object_4)
- Effects: add next(object_13, object_10); delete vase(object_13, object_4)

Step 7 (t = 6.0 → 7.0)
- Action: clip object_11 object_4 object_10
- Preconditions: hand(object_11), sneeze(object_4), texture(object_10), next(object_4, object_10), next(object_11, object_10)
- Effects: add vase(object_11, object_4); delete next(object_11, object_10)

Step 8 (t = 7.0 → 8.0)
- Action: wretched object_4 object_10 object_11 object_3
- Preconditions: sneeze(object_4), texture(object_10), texture(object_11), stupendous(object_3), next(object_4, object_10), collect(object_10, object_3), collect(object_11, object_3)
- Effects: add next(object_4, object_11); delete next(object_4, object_10)

Step 9 (t = 8.0 → 9.0)
- Action: tightfisted object_14 object_4 object_11
- Preconditions: hand(object_14), sneeze(object_4), texture(object_11), next(object_4, object_11), vase(object_14, object_4)
- Effects: add next(object_14, object_11); delete vase(object_14, object_4)

Step 10 (t = 9.0 → 10.0)
- Action: tightfisted object_12 object_4 object_9
- Preconditions: hand(object_12), sneeze(object_4), texture(object_9), next(object_4, object_9), vase(object_12, object_4)
- Effects: add next(object_12, object_9); delete vase(object_12, object_4)

Step 11 (t = 10.0 → 11.0)
- Action: clip object_12 object_4 object_11
- Preconditions: hand(object_12), sneeze(object_4), texture(object_11), next(object_4, object_11), next(object_12, object_11)
- Effects: add vase(object_12, object_4); delete next(object_12, object_11)

Step 12 (t = 11.0 → 12.0)
- Action: wretched object_4 object_9 object_6 object_2
- Preconditions: sneeze(object_4), texture(object_9), texture(object_6), stupendous(object_2), next(object_4, object_9), collect(object_9, object_2), collect(object_6, object_2)
- Effects: add next(object_4, object_6); delete next(object_4, object_9)

Step 13 (t = 12.0 → 13.0)
- Action: tightfisted object_12 object_4 object_6
- Preconditions: hand(object_12), sneeze(object_4), texture(object_6), next(object_4, object_6), vase(object_12, object_4)
- Effects: add next(object_12, object_6); delete vase(object_12, object_4)

Step 14 (t = 13.0 → 14.0)
- Action: wretched object_4 object_6 object_5 object_1
- Preconditions: sneeze(object_4), texture(object_6), texture(object_5), stupendous(object_1), next(object_4, object_6), collect(object_6, object_1), collect(object_5, object_1)
- Effects: add next(object_4, object_5); delete next(object_4, object_6)

Step 15 (t = 14.0 → 15.0)
- Action: tightfisted object_11 object_4 object_5
- Preconditions: hand(object_11), sneeze(object_4), texture(object_5), next(object_4, object_5), vase(object_11, object_4)
- Effects: add next(object_11, object_5); delete vase(object_11, object_4)

Final status (after t = 15.0)
- The actions above produce the following goal-relevant facts (as intended by the plan):
  - next(object_11, object_5)  (created at Step 15)
  - next(object_12, object_9)  (created at Step 10)
  - next(object_13, object_10) (created at Step 6)
  - next(object_12, object_6)  (created at Step 13)
  - next(object_14, object_11) (created at Step 9)
- The plan has 15 steps and cost = 15 (each action treated as unit cost).

Notes:
- Each step strictly follows the action sequence provided in the plan.
- Each step reports a 1.0 time unit duration and the timestamp interval when it executes.
- Preconditions and effects are stated in the same predicate-language used in the specification (hand, sneeze, texture, next, vase, collect, stupendous) to make verification straightforward.
