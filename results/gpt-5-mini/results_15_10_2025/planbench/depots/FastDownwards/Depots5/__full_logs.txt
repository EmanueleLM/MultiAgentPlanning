PROBLEM
------------------------------
I am playing with a set of objects. Here are the actions I can do

Paltry object_0 object_1 object_2.

NATURAL-PLAN sas_plan_0
------------------------------
Step 1 — (time 0.0 → 1.0; duration 1.0, cost = 1)
- Action: sip
- Agent: planner_agent
- Parameters (concrete binding): src = object_5, target = object_8, child = object_6
- Informal description: planner_agent reattaches child object_6 from its current parent object_5 to become the successor of object_8.

Preconditions required by sip:
1. (agent planner_agent) — planner_agent must exist as an actor.
   - Satisfied: present in the problem initial facts.
2. (next object_5 object_6) — child must currently be linked to src parent object_5.
   - Satisfied: initial facts include next object_5 object_6.
3. (succ-free object_8) — the target parent must be free to accept a successor.
   - Satisfied: initial facts include succ-free object_8.

Effects of the action (applied at the end of the step):
- Deletes: (next object_5 object_6) — the old link from object_5 to object_6 is removed.
- Adds: (next object_8 object_6) — a new link from object_8 to object_6 is created.
- Adds: (succ-free object_5) — object_5 becomes successor-free because it lost its child.
- Deletes (implicit in the sip schema): (succ-free object_8) — object_8 is no longer successor-free after receiving object_6.

State consequences relevant to the goal:
- After this action the fact (next object_8 object_6) holds, which exactly satisfies the planning goal.
- No preconditions were missing or ambiguous; all required facts were present in the initial state and no additional assumptions were needed.

Conclusion: Executing the single plan step sip planner_agent object_5 object_8 object_6 (duration 1.0) is valid from the given initial state and achieves the goal next object_8 object_6.

NATURAL-PLAN sas_plan_0
------------------------------
Here is a clear, step-by-step, human-readable execution of the provided plan. I list preconditions that are checked before each action, the action effects, a timestamp/duration for each step (unit durations), and the state changes that result.

Initial relevant facts (from the problem):
- hand: object_8, object_7
- cats: object_0, object_1
- texture: object_5, object_6, object_7
- next: object_0→object_7, object_1→object_7, object_4→object_6, object_5→object_7, object_8→object_7, object_0→object_6, object_3→object_5, object_7→object_6, object_8→object_5
- other facts (collect, sneeze, spring, stupendous) as given but not needed for these two actions

Planned actions (in order; do not add or remove steps):
1) sip object_8 object_0 object_7
   - Timestamp: t = 0.0
   - Duration: 1.0 time unit
   - Action meaning (from the domain): create vase(object_8, object_0) and remove next(object_8, object_7)
   - Preconditions checked before execution:
     - hand object_8 — present
     - cats object_0 — present
     - texture object_7 — present
     - next object_8 object_7 — present
     - next object_0 object_7 — present
     All preconditions are satisfied in the initial state.
   - Effects applied at completion (t = 1.0):
     - Added: vase(object_8, object_0)
     - Removed: next(object_8, object_7)
   - Resulting relevant state after step 1:
     - vase(object_8, object_0) is now true
     - next(object_8, object_7) is now false
     - All other initially true facts remain unless listed above

2) paltry object_8 object_0 object_6
   - Timestamp: t = 1.0
   - Duration: 1.0 time unit
   - Action meaning (from the domain): add next(object_8, object_6) and remove vase(object_8, object_0)
   - Preconditions checked before execution (at t = 1.0):
     - hand object_8 — present
     - cats object_0 — present
     - texture object_6 — present
     - vase object_8 object_0 — present (created by step 1) — satisfied
     - next object_0 object_6 — present in the initial state — satisfied
     All preconditions are satisfied after step 1.
   - Effects applied at completion (t = 2.0):
     - Added: next(object_8, object_6)
     - Removed: vase(object_8, object_0)
   - Resulting relevant state after step 2:
     - next(object_8, object_6) is now true (goal-achieving fact)
     - vase(object_8, object_0) is now false
     - next(object_7, object_6) remained true from the initial state

Final check (after t = 2.0):
- Goal required: next object_7 object_6 and next object_8 object_6
  - next(object_7, object_6) was true in the initial state and remained true
  - next(object_8, object_6) was produced by step 2
- Both goal facts are satisfied. The plan succeeds (cost = 2 actions, unit cost each).

FINAL-PLAN
------------------------------
I don’t have the contents of analysis_1 and analysis_2 from the other agents — those are required to produce a correct, conservative PDDL domain + problem(s). Please provide the two structured analyses (analysis_1 and analysis_2). To make sure I produce a Fast Downward–compatible PDDL set that preserves all constraints, please include (or confirm) the following items in each analysis:

Required content for each analysis (please paste the structured output you received):
- Objects/entities (with types if available). Example: tasks, agents, resources, locations, time-slots.
- Actions (informal schemas): for each action list
  - name
  - parameters (types)
  - preconditions (positive/negative)
  - effects (adds and deletes)
  - duration if any (or instantaneous)
  - whether action is exclusive on a resource (resource locking)
- Initial state facts (which predicates are true at start; any numeric/time values)
- Goals (logical conditions that must hold at the end)
- Hard constraints / preferences expressed as strict constraints that must be enforced (e.g., "A cannot start before time 10", "X and Y cannot be scheduled concurrently", "prefer earliest but treat as hard earliest")
- If time windows or availability slots exist, provide exact start/end times or discrete slots and which agent/resource each applies to.

Optional but very helpful:
- Types hierarchy (e.g., agent, vehicle, package)
- A small example plan (if known) to clarify intended semantics
- Any deadlines or maxima (e.g., "all tasks must finish by T=100")

How I will produce the PDDL (what you can expect):
- I will merge the distinct action schemas from both analyses into a single domain file, keeping actions logically separate and preserving their preconditions and effects exactly as given.
- I will model resources and exclusivity conservatively (e.g., use mutex predicates or numeric resource counters) and encode natural-language preferences as hard constraints as you required.
- If time is involved, I will use PDDL 2.1 durative-actions and numeric fluents to model start/finish times and durations; I will treat "earliest" constraints as hard numeric inequalities.
- Any ambiguity will be resolved conservatively (I will document these resolution choices inside PDDL comments).
- I will wrap the domain in <domain>...</domain> and each problem in <problem>...</problem> tags as you requested, and include comments to map problems to scenarios if multiple problem files are needed.

If you prefer, you can also paste the raw natural-language descriptions and I will extract and convert them into the structured analyses myself — but that will require me to make more assumptions and I will document them explicitly.

When you paste analysis_1 and analysis_2 I will produce:
- One .pddl domain file enclosed in <domain> tags
- One or more .pddl problem files enclosed in <problem> tags (with comments mapping scenario → problem)
- In-PDDL comments explaining any conservative assumptions I had to make

Send analysis_1 and analysis_2 and I’ll generate the PDDL files.

Step 1 — time 0s (duration 1s)
Action: memory_analyst1(object_1, object_6, object_7)
- Agent: analyst1
- Meaning: move the "next" link for object_1 from object_6 to object_7.
- Preconditions checked: cats(object_1), spring(object_6), spring(object_7), next(object_1, object_6).
- Effects applied: add next(object_1, object_7); remove next(object_1, object_6).

Step 2 — time 1s (duration 1s)
Action: sip_analyst1(object_9, object_1, object_7)
- Agent: analyst1
- Meaning: create vase(object_9, object_1) by using the shared next links to object_7.
- Preconditions checked: hand(object_9), cats(object_1), texture(object_7), next(object_9, object_7), next(object_1, object_7).
- Effects applied: add vase(object_9, object_1); remove next(object_9, object_7).

Step 3 — time 2s (duration 1s)
Action: memory_analyst1(object_1, object_7, object_6)
- Agent: analyst1
- Meaning: move the "next" link for object_1 from object_7 back to object_6.
- Preconditions checked: cats(object_1), spring(object_7), spring(object_6), next(object_1, object_7).
- Effects applied: add next(object_1, object_6); remove next(object_1, object_7).

Step 4 — time 3s (duration 1s)
Action: paltry_analyst1(object_9, object_1, object_6)
- Agent: analyst1
- Meaning: use vase(object_9, object_1) and next(object_1, object_6) to create next(object_9, object_6) (and consume the vase).
- Preconditions checked: hand(object_9), cats(object_1), texture(object_6), vase(object_9, object_1), next(object_1, object_6).
- Effects applied: add next(object_9, object_6); remove vase(object_9, object_1).

Result (after 4 steps)
- Goal facts achieved: next(object_8, object_7) (already true from the initial state) and next(object_9, object_6) (established at Step 4).
- Plan cost: 4 steps.

FINAL-PLAN
------------------------------
I don’t have the two agents’ analysis artifacts nor the public action model in your message. I can’t safely invent initial facts or action preconditions/effects because you explicitly required I not add unavailable facts. Please provide the missing pieces so I can generate correct FastDownwards-compatible PDDL.

To proceed, please paste (or summarize) these items:

1. Public action model: for each action named paltry, sip, clip, wretched, memory, tightfisted provide:
   - action name
   - parameter list (objects and types)
   - preconditions (positive and negative predicates)
   - effects (add and delete predicates)
   - if temporal/durational, the duration and any time-based constraints (otherwise we’ll produce classical PDDL)

2. Agent analyses:
   - agent_A: its initial facts (predicates and objects), which actions it can perform (if different from the public actions), and its goal(s) or constraints (e.g., “avoid slot X”, “earliest time before Y”).
   - agent_B: same as above.

3. Any typing information (object types, e.g., agent, tool, slot), and any shared/static predicates.

4. Which scenario you want:
   - a single combined problem that includes both agents and a joint goal, or
   - two separate problem instances (one per agent).

5. Any hard temporal constraints to encode as strict constraints (e.g., “slot S is unavailable”, “must finish before time T”). If you need time modeling, say whether numeric/time PDDL or timeline is acceptable (FastDownwards supports PDDL2.1 numeric durative actions — I can use durative actions if you provide durations).

If you want, you can paste the agent_A and agent_B analyses and the public model exactly as you have them; I’ll convert them into a FastDownwards-compatible PDDL domain and problem and enclose them in <domain>...</domain> and <problem>...</problem> tags.

NATURAL-PLAN sas_plan_1
------------------------------
Summary: The following is a step-by-step, human-readable trace of the supplied PDDL plan. Each step shows the action, its parameters, which preconditions are being used (from the current state), the state change (effects), an estimated timestamp/duration (1 time unit per action), and a short note on whether the preconditions hold. The trace follows the plan exactly and ends by confirming the requested goals are achieved.

Assumed start time t = 0.0. Each action is treated as taking 1.0 time unit. Total cost = 8.

1) t = 0.0 → 1.0
Action: clip object_9 object_4 object_7
- Meaning (from domain): With hand = object_9 and sneeze = object_4 and texture = object_7, if next(object_4, object_7) and next(object_9, object_7) hold, create vase(object_9, object_4) and remove next(object_9, object_7).
- Preconditions used: hand(object_9), sneeze(object_4), texture(object_7), next(object_4,object_7), next(object_9,object_7).
- Are preconditions satisfied now? Yes (next object_4 object_7 and next object_9 object_7 are present initially).
- Effects (state change): add (vase object_9 object_4); delete (next object_9 object_7).
- Note: After this step next(9,7) is removed; vase(9,4) appears.

2) t = 1.0 → 2.0
Action: tightfisted object_9 object_4 object_8
- Meaning: With hand = object_9, sneeze = object_4, texture = object_8, if next(object_4,object_8) and vase(object_9,object_4) hold, produce next(object_9,object_8) and remove vase(object_9,object_4).
- Preconditions used: hand(object_9), sneeze(object_4), texture(object_8), next(object_4,object_8), vase(object_9,object_4).
- Are preconditions satisfied now? Yes (next object_4 object_8 was in the initial state; vase(9,4) was created in step 1).
- Effects: add (next object_9 object_8); delete (vase object_9 object_4).
- Note: After this step next(9,8) exists (goal-relevant).

3) t = 2.0 → 3.0
Action: wretched object_3 object_5 object_6 object_1
- Meaning: With sneeze = object_3, textures = object_5 & object_6, stupendous = object_1, if next(object_3,object_5) and collect(object_5,object_1) and collect(object_6,object_1) hold, change next(object_3,object_5) into next(object_3,object_6) (i.e., add next(3,6) and remove next(3,5)).
- Preconditions used: sneeze(object_3), texture(object_5), texture(object_6), stupendous(object_1), next(object_3,object_5), collect(object_5,object_1), collect(object_6,object_1).
- Are preconditions satisfied now? Yes (these facts are present in the initial state).
- Effects: add (next object_3 object_6); delete (next object_3 object_5).
- Note: Next link for object_3 moves from object_5 to object_6.

4) t = 3.0 → 4.0
Action: clip object_9 object_3 object_6
- Meaning: With hand = object_9 and sneeze = object_3 and texture = object_6, if next(object_3,object_6) and next(object_9,object_6) hold, create vase(object_9,object_3) and remove next(object_9,object_6).
- Preconditions used: hand(object_9), sneeze(object_3), texture(object_6), next(object_3,object_6), next(object_9,object_6).
- Are preconditions satisfied now? Yes (next(3,6) was added in step 3; next(9,6) existed initially).
- Effects: add (vase object_9 object_3); delete (next object_9 object_6).
- Note: vase(9,3) appears; next(9,6) is removed.

5) t = 4.0 → 5.0
Action: wretched object_3 object_6 object_5 object_1
- Meaning: With sneeze = object_3, textures = object_6 & object_5, stupendous = object_1, if next(object_3,object_6) and collect(object_6,object_1) and collect(object_5,object_1) hold, change next(object_3,object_6) into next(object_3,object_5).
- Preconditions used: sneeze(object_3), texture(object_6), texture(object_5), stupendous(object_1), next(object_3,object_6), collect(object_6,object_1), collect(object_5,object_1).
- Are preconditions satisfied now? Yes (next(3,6) exists from step 3; collect facts were initial).
- Effects: add (next object_3 object_5); delete (next object_3 object_6).
- Note: This reverts object_3’s next link back to object_5.

6) t = 5.0 → 6.0
Action: tightfisted object_9 object_3 object_5
- Meaning: With hand = object_9, sneeze = object_3, texture = object_5, if next(object_3,object_5) and vase(object_9,object_3) hold, produce next(object_9,object_5) and remove vase(object_9,object_3).
- Preconditions used: hand(object_9), sneeze(object_3), texture(object_5), next(object_3,object_5), vase(object_9,object_3).
- Are preconditions satisfied now? Yes (next(3,5) was restored in step 5; vase(9,3) created in step 4).
- Effects: add (next object_9 object_5); delete (vase object_9 object_3).
- Note: next(9,5) now exists.

7) t = 6.0 → 7.0
Action: sip object_9 object_0 object_5
- Meaning: With hand = object_9 and cats = object_0 and texture = object_5, if next(object_9,object_5) and next(object_0,object_5) hold, create vase(object_9,object_0) and remove next(object_9,object_5).
- Preconditions used: hand(object_9), cats(object_0), texture(object_5), next(object_9,object_5), next(object_0,object_5).
- Are preconditions satisfied now? Yes (next(9,5) from step 6; next(0,5) was in initial state).
- Effects: add (vase object_9 object_0); delete (next object_9 object_5).
- Note: vase(9,0) appears.

8) t = 7.0 → 8.0
Action: paltry object_9 object_0 object_7
- Meaning: With hand = object_9 and cats = object_0 and texture = object_7, if vase(object_9,object_0) and next(object_0,object_7) hold, create next(object_9,object_7) and remove vase(object_9,object_0).
- Preconditions used: hand(object_9), cats(object_0), texture(object_7), vase(object_9,object_0), next(object_0,object_7).
- Are preconditions satisfied now? Yes (vase(9,0) was created in step 7; next(0,7) was present initially).
- Effects: add (next object_9 object_7); delete (vase object_9 object_0).
- Note: next(9,7) is restored/created.

Final state relevant facts (after step 8)
- next(object_9, object_8) — created in step 2
- next(object_9, object_7) — created in step 8

Goal check
- Required goal: (next object_9 object_8) and (next object_9 object_7).
- Both are present in the final state (see notes above). Therefore the plan achieves the goal.

Total plan duration (estimated): 8.0 time units
Total cost (as given): 8

End of trace.
