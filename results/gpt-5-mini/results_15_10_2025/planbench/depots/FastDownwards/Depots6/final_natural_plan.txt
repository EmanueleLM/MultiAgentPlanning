Below is a clear, step-by-step, human-readable execution of the given PDDL plan. I list each plan step in order, assign it a timestamp (each action = 1 time unit), show the acting agent, give a short natural-language description, list the action's required preconditions (from the public action specs) and the expected effects (add / delete). For each precondition I indicate whether it is satisfied from the initial state or by a prior step (referencing the step number that produced it).

Timeline: step N executes at time t = N-1 and lasts 1 time unit.
