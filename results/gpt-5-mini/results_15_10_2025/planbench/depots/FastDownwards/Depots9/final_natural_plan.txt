Summary of initial relevant facts (t = 0s):
- Objects present: object_0 … object_11.
- Relevant predicates true initially:
  - hand: object_9, object_10
  - sneeze: object_3, object_4
  - texture: object_5, object_6, object_7, object_8
  - next: (object_0 → object_5), (object_10 → object_5), (object_3 → object_5), (object_4 → object_8), (object_9 → object_5)
  - collect: (object_5 → object_1), (object_6 → object_1), (object_7 → object_2), (object_8 → object_2)
  - stupendous: object_1, object_2
- Goal to reach: next object_10 object_6 and next object_9 object_6.

Plan (followed exactly as given). Each step shows a timestamp, duration (assumed 1s per action), required preconditions and whether they hold, effects applied, and the relevant resulting predicates after the step.

Step 1 — t = 0s, duration 1s
Action: clip object_9 object_3 object_5
- Formal preconditions (clip ?a ?b ?c): hand ?a, sneeze ?b, texture ?c, next ?b ?c, next ?a ?c.
- Checked for parameters (object_9, object_3, object_5):
  - hand object_9: true
  - sneeze object_3: true
  - texture object_5: true
  - next object_3 object_5: true
  - next object_9 object_5: true
- All preconditions satisfied → action applicable.
- Effects applied:
  - Add: vase object_9 object_3
  - Delete: next object_9 object_5
- Relevant state after step 1:
  - next no longer includes (object_9 → object_5)
  - vase includes (object_9, object_3)
  - next still includes (object_10 → object_5) and (object_3 → object_5)

Step 2 — t = 1s, duration 1s
Action: clip object_10 object_3 object_5
- Preconditions (clip ?a ?b ?c) for (object_10, object_3, object_5):
  - hand object_10: true
  - sneeze object_3: true
  - texture object_5: true
  - next object_3 object_5: true (still true after step 1)
  - next object_10 object_5: true
- All preconditions satisfied → action applicable.
- Effects applied:
  - Add: vase object_10 object_3
  - Delete: next object_10 object_5
- Relevant state after step 2:
  - next no longer includes (object_10 → object_5)
  - vase includes (object_10, object_3) and (object_9, object_3)
  - next still includes (object_3 → object_5) (note this will be modified next)

Step 3 — t = 2s, duration 1s
Action: wretched object_3 object_5 object_6 object_1
- Preconditions (wretched ?a ?b ?c ?d): sneeze ?a, texture ?b, texture ?c, stupendous ?d, next ?a ?b, collect ?b ?d, collect ?c ?d.
- For (object_3, object_5, object_6, object_1):
  - sneeze object_3: true
  - texture object_5: true
  - texture object_6: true
  - stupendous object_1: true
  - next object_3 object_5: true (present before this step)
  - collect object_5 object_1: true
  - collect object_6 object_1: true
- All preconditions satisfied → action applicable.
- Effects applied:
  - Add: next object_3 object_6
  - Delete: next object_3 object_5
- Relevant state after step 3:
  - next now includes (object_3 → object_6)
  - next no longer includes (object_3 → object_5)
  - previously deleted next facts for object_9 and object_10 → object_5 remain deleted

Step 4 — t = 3s, duration 1s
Action: tightfisted object_9 object_3 object_6
- Preconditions (tightfisted ?a ?b ?c): hand ?a, sneeze ?b, texture ?c, next ?b ?c, vase ?a ?b.
- For (object_9, object_3, object_6):
  - hand object_9: true
  - sneeze object_3: true
  - texture object_6: true
  - next object_3 object_6: true (added in step 3)
  - vase object_9 object_3: true (added in step 1)
- All preconditions satisfied → action applicable.
- Effects applied:
  - Add: next object_9 object_6
  - Delete: vase object_9 object_3
- Relevant state after step 4:
  - next now includes (object_9 → object_6)
  - vase no longer includes (object_9, object_3) but still includes (object_10, object_3)

Step 5 — t = 4s, duration 1s
Action: tightfisted object_10 object_3 object_6
- Preconditions (tightfisted ?a ?b ?c) for (object_10, object_3, object_6):
  - hand object_10: true
  - sneeze object_3: true
  - texture object_6: true
  - next object_3 object_6: true (from step 3)
  - vase object_10 object_3: true (added in step 2)
- All preconditions satisfied → action applicable.
- Effects applied:
  - Add: next object_10 object_6
  - Delete: vase object_10 object_3
- Relevant state after step 5:
  - next now includes (object_10 → object_6)
  - vase no longer includes (object_10, object_3)
  - next includes both (object_9 → object_6) and (object_10 → object_6)

Final assessment — t = 5s
- Goal checked: next object_10 object_6 and next object_9 object_6
- Both are true after step 5.
- Conclusion: The provided plan (the five actions listed, executed in the given order) is applicable at each step under the domain definitions and initial facts, and it successfully achieves the goal. Total plan duration (as reported here): 5s (1s per action, timestamps from 0s to 5s).
