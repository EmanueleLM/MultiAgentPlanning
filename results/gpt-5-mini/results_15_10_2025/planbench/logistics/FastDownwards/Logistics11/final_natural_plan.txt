Plan (stepwise, 1.0 time unit per action, starting at t=0.0). Each step lists the action (namespaced by agent), its parameters, a short plain-English description, the key preconditions used, and the effects produced.

1) t=0.0 → 1.0
Action: planner_A_clip(object_9, object_3, object_5)
Description: Agent planner_A clips object_9 with sneeze-source object_3 at texture object_5, creating a vase relation between object_9 and object_3 and removing the link next(object_9, object_5).
Preconditions (checked): hand(object_9), sneeze(object_3), texture(object_5), next(object_3, object_5), next(object_9, object_5).
Effects: add vase(object_9, object_3). remove next(object_9, object_5).

2) t=1.0 → 2.0
Action: planner_B_tightfisted(object_9, object_3, object_6)
Description: Agent planner_B uses tightfisted on object_9 with sneeze-source object_3 and texture object_6 to move the "next" link from (object_3→object_6) to (object_9→object_6); the vase between object_9 and object_3 is consumed.
Preconditions (checked): hand(object_9), sneeze(object_3), texture(object_6), next(object_3, object_6), vase(object_9, object_3).
Effects: add next(object_9, object_6). remove vase(object_9, object_3).

3) t=2.0 → 3.0
Action: planner_A_sip(object_11, object_0, object_5)
Description: Agent planner_A sips with hand object_11, creating vase(object_11, object_0) (using the shared texture object_5) and removing next(object_11, object_5).
Preconditions (checked): hand(object_11), cats(object_0), texture(object_5), next(object_11, object_5), next(object_0, object_5).
Effects: add vase(object_11, object_0). remove next(object_11, object_5).

4) t=3.0 → 4.0
Action: planner_A_sip(object_10, object_0, object_5)
Description: Agent planner_A sips with hand object_10, creating vase(object_10, object_0) and removing next(object_10, object_5).
Preconditions (checked): hand(object_10), cats(object_0), texture(object_5), next(object_10, object_5), next(object_0, object_5).
Effects: add vase(object_10, object_0). remove next(object_10, object_5).

5) t=4.0 → 5.0
Action: planner_B_memory(object_0, object_5, object_7)
Description: Agent planner_B applies memory to object_0 to change its next-link from object_5 to object_7 (uses springs at object_5 and object_7).
Preconditions (checked): cats(object_0), spring(object_5), spring(object_7), next(object_0, object_5).
Effects: add next(object_0, object_7). remove next(object_0, object_5).

6) t=5.0 → 6.0
Action: planner_A_paltry(object_11, object_0, object_7)
Description: Agent planner_A uses paltry with hand object_11 and vase(object_11, object_0) and next(object_0, object_7) to create next(object_11, object_7), consuming vase(object_11, object_0).
Preconditions (checked): hand(object_11), cats(object_0), texture(object_7), vase(object_11, object_0), next(object_0, object_7).
Effects: add next(object_11, object_7). remove vase(object_11, object_0).

7) t=6.0 → 7.0
Action: planner_A_paltry(object_10, object_0, object_7)
Description: Agent planner_A uses paltry with hand object_10 and vase(object_10, object_0) and next(object_0, object_7) to create next(object_10, object_7), consuming vase(object_10, object_0).
Preconditions (checked): hand(object_10), cats(object_0), texture(object_7), vase(object_10, object_0), next(object_0, object_7).
Effects: add next(object_10, object_7). remove vase(object_10, object_0).

8) t=7.0 → 8.0
Action: planner_B_wretched(object_4, object_7, object_8, object_2)
Description: Agent planner_B applies wretched at sneeze-source object_4 to move the next-link from (object_4→object_7) to (object_4→object_8), using textures at object_7 and object_8 and collect relations into stupendous object_2.
Preconditions (checked): sneeze(object_4), texture(object_7), texture(object_8), stupendous(object_2), next(object_4, object_7), collect(object_7, object_2), collect(object_8, object_2).
Effects: add next(object_4, object_8). remove next(object_4, object_7).

9) t=8.0 → 9.0
Action: planner_A_clip(object_9, object_4, object_8)
Description: Agent planner_A clips object_9 with sneeze-source object_4 at texture object_8, creating vase(object_9, object_4) and removing next(object_9, object_8).
Preconditions (checked): hand(object_9), sneeze(object_4), texture(object_8), next(object_4, object_8), next(object_9, object_8).
Effects: add vase(object_9, object_4). remove next(object_9, object_8).

10) t=9.0 → 10.0
Action: planner_B_wretched(object_4, object_8, object_7, object_2)
Description: Agent planner_B applies wretched again at object_4 to move next from (object_4→object_8) back to (object_4→object_7), using textures at object_8 and object_7 and the same stupendous object_2 and collect relations.
Preconditions (checked): sneeze(object_4), texture(object_8), texture(object_7), stupendous(object_2), next(object_4, object_8), collect(object_8, object_2), collect(object_7, object_2).
Effects: add next(object_4, object_7). remove next(object_4, object_8).

11) t=10.0 → 11.0
Action: planner_B_tightfisted(object_9, object_4, object_7)
Description: Agent planner_B uses tightfisted with hand object_9 and vase(object_9, object_4) and next(object_4, object_7) to create next(object_9, object_7) and consume vase(object_9, object_4).
Preconditions (checked): hand(object_9), sneeze(object_4), texture(object_7), next(object_4, object_7), vase(object_9, object_4).
Effects: add next(object_9, object_7). remove vase(object_9, object_4).

Final state relevant to the goal (after t=11.0):
- next(object_10, object_7) — created at step 7
- next(object_11, object_7) — created at step 6
- next(object_9, object_7)  — created at step 11
- next(object_10, object_8) — present from initial state (never removed)
- next(object_9, object_6)  — created at step 2

All goal next-relations are achieved at the end of the sequence.
