1) Step 1 — Assign task
   - Action: assign-task object_1 → object_5 in object_6 at object_10
   - Human-readable: Assign Bob (object_1) to the task "write_summary" (object_5) in room1 (object_6) at timeslot t3 (object_10).
   - Timeslot: t3
   - Preconditions checked: Bob is available at t3, room1 is free at t3, "write_summary" is allowed at t3 — all satisfied.
   - Immediate effects (state updates): 
     - assigned(write_summary, Bob)
     - scheduled(write_summary, t3)
     - agent-free(Bob, t3) is removed
     - room-free(room1, t3) is removed

2) Step 2 — Complete task
   - Action: complete-task object_1 → object_5 at object_10
   - Human-readable: Bob completes the "write_summary" task (object_5) at timeslot t3 (object_10).
   - Timeslot: t3
   - Preconditions checked: write_summary is assigned to Bob and scheduled at t3 — satisfied.
   - Immediate effects:
     - completed(write_summary)

3) Step 3 — Produce deliverable (agenda)
   - Action: produce-agenda object_1 → object_12 for object_5
   - Human-readable: Bob (object_1) produces the "agenda" (object_12), based on the completed "write_summary" (object_5).
   - Timeslot: occurs immediately after completion of write_summary (effectively at/after t3)
   - Preconditions checked: Bob exists, agenda exists, write_summary is completed, and write_summary is associated with agenda — all satisfied.
   - Immediate effects:
     - produced(Bob, agenda)

4) Step 4 — Assign task
   - Action: assign-task object_0 → object_3 in object_7 at object_9
   - Human-readable: Assign Alice (object_0) to the task "prepare_report" (object_3) in room2 (object_7) at timeslot t2 (object_9).
   - Timeslot: t2
   - Preconditions checked: Alice is available at t2, room2 is free at t2, "prepare_report" is allowed at t2 — all satisfied.
   - Immediate effects:
     - assigned(prepare_report, Alice)
     - scheduled(prepare_report, t2)
     - agent-free(Alice, t2) is removed
     - room-free(room2, t2) is removed

5) Step 5 — Complete task
   - Action: complete-task object_0 → object_3 at object_9
   - Human-readable: Alice completes the "prepare_report" task (object_3) at timeslot t2 (object_9).
   - Timeslot: t2
   - Preconditions checked: prepare_report is assigned to Alice and scheduled at t2 — satisfied.
   - Immediate effects:
     - completed(prepare_report)

6) Step 6 — Produce deliverable (report)
   - Action: produce-agenda object_1 → object_11 for object_3
   - Human-readable: Bob (object_1) produces the "report" (object_11) based on the completed "prepare_report" (object_3).
   - Timeslot: occurs immediately after completion of prepare_report (effectively at/after t2)
   - Preconditions checked: Bob exists, report exists, prepare_report is completed, and prepare_report is associated with report — all satisfied.
   - Immediate effects:
     - produced(Bob, report)

Final outcome / goal achievement:
- After these six steps Bob (object_1) has produced both deliverables:
  - produced(object_1, object_12) — the agenda
  - produced(object_1, object_11) — the report
- These satisfy the stated goal (Bob is the producer of both the report and the agenda).
- Total plan cost (as given): 6 (unit cost).
