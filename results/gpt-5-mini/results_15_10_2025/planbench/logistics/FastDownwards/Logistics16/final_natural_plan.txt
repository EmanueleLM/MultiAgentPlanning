Plan summary (8 steps, unit cost per action => total cost = 8)

Step 1 — t = 0.0s → 1.0s
Action: Clip(object_9, object_3, object_5)
- Informal: Apply Clip to object_9 with reference object_3 to set its successor to object_5.
- Preconditions satisfied at execution: collect(object_9, object_3), stupendous(object_3), texture(object_9).
- Effect (added): next(object_9, object_5).

Step 2 — t = 1.0s → 2.0s
Action: Memory(object_10, object_1, object_6)
- Informal: Store/establish object_6 as a successor of object_10 using object_1 as reference.
- Preconditions satisfied at execution: stupendous(object_1), texture(object_6).
- Effect (added): next(object_10, object_6).

Step 3 — t = 2.0s → 3.0s
Action: Memory(object_10, object_1, object_8)
- Informal: Store/establish object_8 as a successor of object_10 using object_1 as reference.
- Preconditions satisfied at execution: stupendous(object_1), texture(object_8).
- Effect (added): next(object_10, object_8).

Step 4 — t = 3.0s → 4.0s
Action: Memory(object_11, object_1, object_6)
- Informal: Store/establish object_6 as a successor of object_11 using object_1 as reference.
- Preconditions satisfied at execution: stupendous(object_1), texture(object_6).
- Effect (added): next(object_11, object_6).

Step 5 — t = 4.0s → 5.0s
Action: Memory(object_11, object_1, object_9)
- Informal: Store/establish object_9 as a successor of object_11 using object_1 as reference.
- Preconditions satisfied at execution: stupendous(object_1), texture(object_9).
- Effect (added): next(object_11, object_9).

Step 6 — t = 5.0s → 6.0s
Action: Memory(object_12, object_1, object_7)
- Informal: Store/establish object_7 as a successor of object_12 using object_1 as reference.
- Preconditions satisfied at execution: stupendous(object_1), texture(object_7).
- Effect (added): next(object_12, object_7).

Step 7 — t = 6.0s → 7.0s
Action: Memory(object_12, object_1, object_8)
- Informal: Store/establish object_8 as a successor of object_12 using object_1 as reference.
- Preconditions satisfied at execution: stupendous(object_1), texture(object_8).
- Effect (added): next(object_12, object_8).

Step 8 — t = 7.0s → 8.0s
Action: Memory(object_13, object_1, object_9)
- Informal: Store/establish object_9 as a successor of object_13 using object_1 as reference.
- Preconditions satisfied at execution: stupendous(object_1), texture(object_9).
- Effect (added): next(object_13, object_9).

Final state contribution (facts added by this plan):
- next(object_9, object_5)
- next(object_10, object_6)
- next(object_10, object_8)
- next(object_11, object_6)
- next(object_11, object_9)
- next(object_12, object_7)
- next(object_12, object_8)
- next(object_13, object_9)

Goal check: After executing the above 8 actions the required goal facts are achieved:
- next object_10 object_8 — achieved at Step 3
- next object_11 object_6 — achieved at Step 4
- next object_12 object_8 — achieved at Step 7
- next object_9 object_5  — achieved at Step 1
- next object_10 object_6 — achieved at Step 2
- next object_11 object_9 — achieved at Step 5
- next object_12 object_7 — achieved at Step 6
- next object_13 object_9 — achieved at Step 8

Total plan duration (based on 1.0s per action as timestamps above): 8.0 seconds. Total cost: 8.
