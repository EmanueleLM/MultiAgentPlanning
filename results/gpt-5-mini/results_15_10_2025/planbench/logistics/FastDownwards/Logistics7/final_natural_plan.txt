Summary schedule (each action 1 time unit, start t=0). I follow the given plan exactly and verify preconditions/effects against the initial facts and prior effects. All six actions are applicable in sequence and the final goal next object_10 object_6 is achieved.

0) t = 0 → 1 (action 1)
- Action: clip object_10 object_5 object_9
- Plain English: With hand object_10, use object_5 (a sneeze) and object_9 (a texture) that are linked (next object_5 object_9) and object_10 is also linked to object_9 (next object_10 object_9) to create vase object_10 object_5 and remove the link next object_10 object_9.
- Preconditions checked at t=0: (hand object_10), (sneeze object_5), (texture object_9), (next object_5 object_9), (next object_10 object_9) — all present in the initial state.
- Effects applied: add (vase object_10 object_5); delete (next object_10 object_9).

1) t = 1 → 2 (action 2)
- Action: wretched object_5 object_9 object_8 object_3
- Plain English: Using sneeze object_5, textures object_9 and object_8, and stupendous object_3, and given next object_5 object_9 plus collect object_9 object_3 and collect object_8 object_3, change the link from object_5→object_9 to object_5→object_8.
- Preconditions checked at t=1: (sneeze object_5), (texture object_9), (texture object_8), (stupendous object_3), (next object_5 object_9) and (collect object_9 object_3), (collect object_8 object_3) — all present (next object_5 object_9 was not touched by step 1).
- Effects applied: add (next object_5 object_8); delete (next object_5 object_9).

2) t = 2 → 3 (action 3)
- Action: tightfisted object_10 object_5 object_8
- Plain English: With hand object_10 and vase object_10 object_5, and given sneeze object_5 and texture object_8 and link next object_5 object_8, change to link next object_10 object_8 and remove the vase object_10 object_5.
- Preconditions checked at t=2: (hand object_10) present, (sneeze object_5) present, (texture object_8) present, (next object_5 object_8) added in step 2, (vase object_10 object_5) added in step 1 — all satisfied.
- Effects applied: add (next object_10 object_8); delete (vase object_10 object_5).

3) t = 3 → 4 (action 4)
- Action: sip object_10 object_0 object_8
- Plain English: With hand object_10, cats object_0 and texture object_8, and given next object_10 object_8 and next object_0 object_8, create vase object_10 object_0 and remove next object_10 object_8.
- Preconditions checked at t=3: (hand object_10), (cats object_0), (texture object_8), (next object_10 object_8) from step 3, (next object_0 object_8) from the initial state — satisfied.
- Effects applied: add (vase object_10 object_0); delete (next object_10 object_8).

4) t = 4 → 5 (action 5)
- Action: memory object_0 object_8 object_6
- Plain English: Using cats object_0 and springs object_8 and object_6, and link next object_0 object_8, change the link to next object_0 object_6 (i.e., replace object_0→object_8 by object_0→object_6).
- Preconditions checked at t=4: (cats object_0) initial, (spring object_8) initial, (spring object_6) initial, (next object_0 object_8) initial and not yet deleted — satisfied.
- Effects applied: add (next object_0 object_6); delete (next object_0 object_8).

5) t = 5 → 6 (action 6)
- Action: paltry object_10 object_0 object_6
- Plain English: With hand object_10, cats object_0 and texture object_6, given vase object_10 object_0 and next object_0 object_6, produce link next object_10 object_6 and remove vase object_10 object_0.
- Preconditions checked at t=5: (hand object_10) present, (cats object_0) present, (texture object_6) present, (vase object_10 object_0) added in step 4, (next object_0 object_6) added in step 5 — all satisfied.
- Effects applied: add (next object_10 object_6); delete (vase object_10 object_0).

Final state and goal
- After step 6 (t = 6) the predicate (next object_10 object_6) has been added.
- The goal (next object_10 object_6) is achieved.
- No missing facts or unmet preconditions occurred during execution: every step's preconditions were satisfied by the initial facts plus effects of prior actions in the exact order given.

Notes about timing and costs
- I used 1 time unit per action (consistent with unit cost = 6). If other durations are required, they can be substituted, but the order must remain identical to preserve precondition/effect dependencies.
