Plan (1 step)

Step 1 — Action: tightfisted(object_0, object_7)
- Timestamp: start = 0.00s, duration = 1.00s, end = 1.00s
- Match to plan entry: (tightfisted object_0 object_7)
- Preconditions checked (from the assembled domain): 
  - (next object_0 object_7) — present in the initial state, so precondition satisfied.
- Effects applied:
  - Add: (next object_8 object_6)
  - No delete effects specified in the domain action.
- Result: The goal (next object_8 object_6) is achieved after this step.

Total plan cost: 1 (unit cost)
