Below is a clear, step-by-step natural-language execution of the provided PDDL plan. Each step matches exactly one action from the plan (no additions or deletions). I give a simple timestamping scheme: each action takes 1 time unit; step 1 starts at t=0.0, step 2 at t=1.0, etc.

Step 1 — t = 0.0 → 1.0 (duration 1.0)
Action: clip object_10 object_4 object_6
What is done: Using hand object_10, perform the "clip" operation that involves sneeze object_4 on texture object_6.
Immediate effects: set vase(object_10, object_4) = true; remove next(object_10, object_6) (next object_10 object_6 becomes false).

Step 2 — t = 1.0 → 2.0 (duration 1.0)
Action: tightfisted object_10 object_4 object_7
What is done: Using hand object_10, perform "tightfisted" with sneeze object_4 to obtain texture object_7.
Immediate effects: set next(object_10, object_7) = true; remove vase(object_10, object_4) (vase object_10 object_4 becomes false).

Step 3 — t = 2.0 → 3.0 (duration 1.0)
Action: sip object_9 object_0 object_5
What is done: Using hand object_9, perform "sip" with cats object_0 and texture object_5.
Immediate effects: set vase(object_9, object_0) = true; remove next(object_9, object_5) (next object_9 object_5 becomes false).

Step 4 — t = 3.0 → 4.0 (duration 1.0)
Action: memory object_0 object_5 object_7
What is done: For cats object_0, perform "memory" moving linkage from spring object_5 to spring object_7.
Immediate effects: set next(object_0, object_7) = true; remove next(object_0, object_5) (next object_0 object_5 becomes false).

Step 5 — t = 4.0 → 5.0 (duration 1.0)
Action: paltry object_9 object_0 object_7
What is done: Using hand object_9, perform "paltry" with cats object_0 and texture object_7.
Immediate effects: set next(object_9, object_7) = true; remove vase(object_9, object_0) (vase object_9 object_0 becomes false).

Step 6 — t = 5.0 → 6.0 (duration 1.0)
Action: clip object_11 object_4 object_6
What is done: Using hand object_11, perform "clip" involving sneeze object_4 on texture object_6.
Immediate effects: set vase(object_11, object_4) = true; remove next(object_11, object_6) (next object_11 object_6 becomes false).

Step 7 — t = 6.0 → 7.0 (duration 1.0)
Action: tightfisted object_11 object_4 object_7
What is done: Using hand object_11, perform "tightfisted" with sneeze object_4 to get texture object_7.
Immediate effects: set next(object_11, object_7) = true; remove vase(object_11, object_4) (vase object_11 object_4 becomes false).

Step 8 — t = 7.0 → 8.0 (duration 1.0)
Action: wretched object_5 object_8 object_9 object_3
What is done: For a = object_5, apply "wretched" moving from texture object_8 to texture object_9, using stupendous object_3.
Immediate effects: set next(object_5, object_9) = true; remove next(object_5, object_8) (next object_5 object_8 becomes false).

Step 9 — t = 8.0 → 9.0 (duration 1.0)
Action: clip object_11 object_5 object_9
What is done: Using hand object_11, perform "clip" that uses sneeze object_5 on texture object_9.
Immediate effects: set vase(object_11, object_5) = true; remove next(object_11, object_9) (next object_11 object_9 becomes false).

Step 10 — t = 9.0 → 10.0 (duration 1.0)
Action: wretched object_5 object_9 object_8 object_3
What is done: For a = object_5, apply "wretched" moving from texture object_9 back to texture object_8, using stupendous object_3.
Immediate effects: set next(object_5, object_8) = true; remove next(object_5, object_9) (next object_5 object_9 becomes false).

Step 11 — t = 10.0 → 11.0 (duration 1.0)
Action: tightfisted object_11 object_5 object_8
What is done: Using hand object_11, perform "tightfisted" with sneeze object_5 to obtain texture object_8.
Immediate effects: set next(object_11, object_8) = true; remove vase(object_11, object_5) (vase object_11 object_5 becomes false).

Summary / Final state relevant to goals (after t = 11.0)
- Achieved next(object_10, object_7) (from Step 2).
- Achieved next(object_11, object_7) (from Step 7).
- Achieved next(object_9, object_7) (from Step 5).
- Achieved next(object_11, object_8) (from Step 11).

Plan cost: 11 actions (unit cost each), total cost = 11.

This sequence follows the provided PDDL plan exactly, lists each action and its immediate effects, and timestamps each step with 1.0 time-unit durations.
