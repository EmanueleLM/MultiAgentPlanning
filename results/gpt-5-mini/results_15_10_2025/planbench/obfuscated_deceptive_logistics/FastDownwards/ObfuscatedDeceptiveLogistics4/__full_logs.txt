PROBLEM
------------------------------
I am playing with a set of objects. Here are the actions I can do

Paltry object_0 object_1 object_2.

I have the following restrictions on my actions:
To perform paltry action, the following facts need to be true: hand object_0, cats object_1, texture object_2, vase object_0 object_1, and next object_1 object_2
Once paltry is performed the following facts will be true: next object_0 object_2
Once paltry is performed the following facts will be false: vase object_0 object_1

FINAL-PLAN
------------------------------
I don’t yet have the two partial models from planner_A and planner_B. I can’t produce a correct combined PDDL domain+problem without them because your instructions forbid inventing availability or preferences beyond what those partial models contain.

Please either
- paste the two partial model descriptions (the planner_A and planner_B summaries), or
- confirm you want me to proceed with some explicit assumptions (I will list them below and will treat any natural-language preferences as hard constraints).

If you want me to proceed without additional input, tell me which of the following assumptions I should apply (or provide alternatives). If you choose to provide the partial models, include for each:
- agent name (e.g., agent_a, agent_b)
- objects (locations, resources, tools, time slots) and their names
- predicates each agent uses and any synonyms
- action descriptions: name, parameters, preconditions, effects, duration or time windows if any
- initial state facts and any unavailable timeslots or reserved resources
- explicit goals (per-agent or global)
- any strict constraints that must be enforced (e.g., "slot 3 is blocked", "agent A must not use resource X", "earliest time = 8")

If you prefer I proceed using assumptions, I will assume:
- Two agents named planner_A and planner_B.
- A small set of shared locations and resources explicitly listed by you (or I will create canonical names but only if you permit).
- Time represented as discrete integer time steps using a numeric fluent (current-time) and actions that advance time; time windows from natural-language preferences will be converted to hard constraints.
- Maintain distinct action names even for conceptually identical actions from different agents (e.g., move_A vs move_B).
- Use only :strips :typing :fluents (if numeric time is used) :negative-preconditions as needed — I’ll confirm the exact :requirements once I have the models.

Which do you prefer? Paste the two partial models now, or confirm you want me to proceed under the listed assumptions (and, if proceeding, specify domain/problem names and whether temporal numeric modeling is acceptable)?

NATURAL-PLAN sas_plan_1
------------------------------
Summary: follow the given two-step plan exactly. All preconditions for each step are satisfied in the provided initial state; no unmet preconditions or contradictions. Total plan cost = 2 unit steps.

Step 1 — sip object_8 object_0 object_7
- Action instance: sip(?o0=object_8, ?o1=object_0, ?o2=object_7)
- Timestamp: start t=0.0, duration 1.0, end t=1.0
- Required preconditions (checked at t=0):
  - (hand object_8) — present in init
  - (cats object_0) — present in init
  - (texture object_7) — present in init
  - (next object_8 object_7) — present in init
  - (next object_0 object_7) — present in init
  => All preconditions satisfied.
- Effects (applied at t=1.0):
  - Add: (vase object_8 object_0)
  - Delete: (next object_8 object_7)
- Resulting immediate state changes after Step 1:
  - (vase object_8 object_0) is now true.
  - (next object_8 object_7) is now false (removed).
  - All other initial facts remain unchanged.

Step 2 — paltry object_8 object_0 object_6
- Action instance: paltry(?o0=object_8, ?o1=object_0, ?o2=object_6)
- Timestamp: start t=1.0, duration 1.0, end t=2.0
- Required preconditions (checked at t=1.0, after Step 1 effects):
  - (hand object_8) — present in init and unchanged
  - (cats object_0) — present in init and unchanged
  - (texture object_6) — present in init
  - (vase object_8 object_0) — added by Step 1 (present at t=1.0)
  - (next object_0 object_6) — present in init
  => All preconditions satisfied.
- Effects (applied at t=2.0):
  - Add: (next object_8 object_6)
  - Delete: (vase object_8 object_0)
- Resulting immediate state changes after Step 2:
  - (next object_8 object_6) is now true.
  - (vase object_8 object_0) is now false (removed).
  - (next object_7 object_6) remained true from the initial state.

Final state check (at t=2.0)
- Goal was: (next object_7 object_6) and (next object_8 object_6)
  - (next object_7 object_6) — true in initial state and unchanged
  - (next object_8 object_6) — achieved by Step 2
=> Both goal predicates are satisfied.

Warnings / Notes
- No action application failed; all preconditions were met when each action was executed.
- The plan follows exactly the provided action sequence and achieves the goal in 2 steps (total duration 2.0 time units).

FINAL-PLAN
------------------------------
I’m missing the two structured analyses and the public action schemas (the action names with their parameter lists, exact preconditions and effects, plus the initial facts/state). Please provide those so I can generate a correct FastDownwards-compatible PDDL domain and the two problem files.

To avoid back-and-forth, please include:
- The public action schemas exactly as they should appear (action name, parameters, preconditions, effects).
- The intended meaning of the predicate (especially “next”) and any type/signatures for predicates.
- The initial state facts (which objects are where, any resources or agent locations, any time/slot availability treated as hard constraints).
- Whether there are multiple agents and which actions are agent-specific (if any).
- Any strict temporal constraints or unavailable slots that must be represented as hard constraints.

If you prefer, paste the two structured analyses and the public action schemas directly and I’ll produce the domain and two problem files (Goal A: next object_7 object_6 and next object_8 object_6; Goal B: next object_7 object_5 and next object_8 object_5).

NATURAL-PLAN sas_plan_3
------------------------------
Goal: achieve (next object_7 object_5) and (next object_8 object_5).

Plan (ordered steps). Each step lists a short timestamp, the action with parameters, the action’s preconditions (as checked at that moment), and the effects applied.

Step 1 — t=00:00 (duration ~1s)
Action: sip object_8 object_0 object_6
- Parameters mapping: ?o0=object_8, ?o1=object_0, ?o2=object_6
- Preconditions (required before performing): hand object_8, cats object_0, texture object_6, next object_8 object_6, next object_0 object_6.
  - These are satisfied in the given initial state: hand(object_8) and next(object_8,object_6) are present; cats(object_0), texture(object_6), next(object_0,object_6) are present.
- Effects (applied immediately): add vase object_8 object_0; remove next object_8 object_6.
- Resulting local change: vase(object_8,object_0) becomes true; next(object_8,object_6) becomes false.

Step 2 — t=00:01 (duration ~1s)
Action: sip object_7 object_0 object_6
- Parameters mapping: ?o0=object_7, ?o1=object_0, ?o2=object_6
- Preconditions: hand object_7, cats object_0, texture object_6, next object_7 object_6, next object_0 object_6.
  - These are satisfied by the initial state (hand(object_7), next(object_7,object_6), cats(object_0), texture(object_6), next(object_0,object_6)).
- Effects: add vase object_7 object_0; remove next object_7 object_6.
- Resulting local change: vase(object_7,object_0) becomes true; next(object_7,object_6) becomes false.

Step 3 — t=00:02 (duration ~1s)
Action: memory object_0 object_6 object_5
- Parameters mapping: ?o0=object_0, ?o1=object_6, ?o2=object_5
- Preconditions: cats object_0, spring object_6, spring object_5, next object_0 object_6.
  - These are satisfied: cats(object_0) and next(object_0,object_6) were in the initial state and spring(object_6), spring(object_5) are present.
- Effects: add next object_0 object_5; remove next object_0 object_6.
- Resulting local change: next(object_0,object_5) becomes true; next(object_0,object_6) becomes false (so any earlier reliance on next(object_0,object_6) is replaced by next(object_0,object_5)).

Step 4 — t=00:03 (duration ~1s)
Action: paltry object_8 object_0 object_5
- Parameters mapping: ?o0=object_8, ?o1=object_0, ?o2=object_5
- Preconditions: hand object_8, cats object_0, texture object_5, vase object_8 object_0, next object_0 object_5.
  - After previous steps: vase(object_8,object_0) was added in Step 1, and memory added next(object_0,object_5) in Step 3; hand(object_8), cats(object_0), texture(object_5) are in the initial facts — so preconditions are satisfied.
- Effects: add next object_8 object_5; remove vase object_8 object_0.
- Resulting local change: next(object_8,object_5) becomes true; vase(object_8,object_0) becomes false.

Step 5 — t=00:04 (duration ~1s)
Action: paltry object_7 object_0 object_5
- Parameters mapping: ?o0=object_7, ?o1=object_0, ?o2=object_5
- Preconditions: hand object_7, cats object_0, texture object_5, vase object_7 object_0, next object_0 object_5.
  - After previous steps: vase(object_7,object_0) was added in Step 2, and next(object_0,object_5) exists from Step 3; hand(object_7), cats(object_0), texture(object_5) are present — so preconditions are satisfied.
- Effects: add next object_7 object_5; remove vase object_7 object_0.
- Resulting local change: next(object_7,object_5) becomes true; vase(object_7,object_0) becomes false.

Final state (relevant facts): next object_8 object_5 and next object_7 object_5 are both true (the plan’s goal achieved). Total steps: 5 (unit cost per step; cumulative duration ~5s in the timeline above).

FINAL-PLAN
------------------------------
<domain>
; Domain: integrated multi-agent domain inferred from planner_A and planner_B analyses.
; Assumptions explicitly introduced (these are not in the original agent statements but are
; necessary to produce a usable STRIPS model and are kept minimal):
; - The actions "memory", "sip", and "paltry" are interpreted as direct manipulators of the binary predicate (next ?a ?b):
;     * memory ?x ?from ?to    : changes (next ?x ?from) into (next ?x ?to)
;     * sip ?actor ?source ?to ?old : requires (hand ?actor), (next ?source ?to), (next ?actor ?old);
;                                 copies (next ?source ?to) to actor and deletes actor's previous next (next ?actor ?old).
;     * paltry ?actor ?source ?to ?old : same pattern as sip (another copy/update action).
;   These interpretations are minimal, consistent with the agents' use of these actions (they appear in the provided plans),
;   and only manipulate the predicates explicitly mentioned by the agents (not introducing new predicates).
; - clip, wretched, tightfisted are declared as available actions (they were listed by the agents) but no usable semantics
;   were provided by the agents; they are included as inert/no-op actions (no preconditions, no effects) to avoid inventing behavior.
; - No temporal/durative modeling is included (classical STRIPS only), per the Fast Downward constraints.
; - All objects are of type object. No additional objects are introduced beyond object_0..object_9.
; Comments above are for human readers. Only these predicates and actions appear in the PDDL below.

NATURAL-PLAN sas_plan_5
------------------------------
Summary: execute the four actions in the given plan in order. I assume each action takes 1 time unit; timestamps show start time for each action. All preconditions listed come from the provided initial facts and earlier effects; no extra actions are added.

Step 1 — t = 0s (duration 1s)
Action: memory object_1 object_6 object_7
Natural description: Move the "next" relation for object_1 from object_6 to object_7.
Preconditions checked (before execution):
- cats object_1 — true in initial state
- spring object_6 — true in initial state
- spring object_7 — true in initial state
- next object_1 object_6 — true in initial state
Effects (applied at completion):
- add next object_1 object_7
- remove next object_1 object_6

State note after Step 1: next object_1 object_7 is true; next object_1 object_6 is no longer true.

Step 2 — t = 1s (duration 1s)
Action: sip object_9 object_1 object_7
Natural description: Create a vase relation between object_9 and object_1 by using the shared relation to object_7; in effect object_9 forms vase(object_9, object_1) and loses its connection to object_7.
Preconditions checked (before execution):
- hand object_9 — true in initial state
- cats object_1 — true in initial state
- texture object_7 — true in initial state
- next object_9 object_7 — true in initial state
- next object_1 object_7 — true (established by Step 1)
Effects (applied at completion):
- add vase object_9 object_1
- remove next object_9 object_7

State note after Step 2: vase(object_9, object_1) is true; next object_9 object_7 is no longer true.

Step 3 — t = 2s (duration 1s)
Action: memory object_1 object_7 object_6
Natural description: Move the "next" relation for object_1 back from object_7 to object_6.
Preconditions checked (before execution):
- cats object_1 — true in initial state
- spring object_7 — true in initial state
- spring object_6 — true in initial state
- next object_1 object_7 — true (established by Step 1)
Effects (applied at completion):
- add next object_1 object_6
- remove next object_1 object_7

State note after Step 3: next object_1 object_6 is true again; next object_1 object_7 is no longer true.

Step 4 — t = 3s (duration 1s)
Action: paltry object_9 object_1 object_6
Natural description: Using the vase between object_9 and object_1 plus object_1’s connection to object_6, create next object_9 object_6 and remove the vase between object_9 and object_1.
Preconditions checked (before execution):
- hand object_9 — true in initial state
- cats object_1 — true in initial state
- texture object_6 — true in initial state
- vase object_9 object_1 — true (established by Step 2)
- next object_1 object_6 — true (established by Step 3)
Effects (applied at completion):
- add next object_9 object_6
- remove vase object_9 object_1

State note after Step 4: next object_9 object_6 is true.

Final verification (t = 4s)
- Goal for planner_A: (next object_8 object_7) and (next object_9 object_6)
  - next object_8 object_7 was true in the initial state and was never removed ⇒ true.
  - next object_9 object_6 was added in Step 4 ⇒ true.
- Both goal conjuncts are satisfied.

Total plan cost: 4 (four unit-cost actions).
