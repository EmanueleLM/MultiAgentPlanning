Each step shows a timestamp (start — end), the action with its object arguments, the preconditions checked at that moment, and the effects (facts added and removed). After the last step I confirm the goal is satisfied. Total plan cost: 5 (total duration shown as 5.0s, 1.0s per action).\n\nStep 1 — t=0.0s → 1.0s\nAction: clip object_9 object_3 object_5\n- Preconditions verified at start:\n  - hand(object_9)\n  - sneeze(object_3)\n  - texture(object_5)\n  - next(object_3, object_5)\n  - next(object_9, object_5)\n- Effects (applied at completion):\n  - Added: vase(object_9, object_3)\n  - Removed: next(object_9, object_5)\n- Notes: This converts the connection (next object_9 → object_5) into a vase relation between object_9 and object_3 while leaving next(object_3,object_5) intact.\n\nStep 2 — t=1.0s → 2.0s\nAction: clip object_10 object_3 object_5\n- Preconditions verified at start:\n  - hand(object_10)\n  - sneeze(object_3)\n  - texture(object_5)\n  - next(object_3, object_5)  (still true)\n  - next(object_10, object_5)\n- Effects (applied at completion):\n  - Added: vase(object_10, object_3)\n  - Removed: next(object_10, object_5)\n- Notes: Similar to step 1 but for object_10; next(object_3,object_5) remains until later actions.\n\nStep 3 — t=2.0s → 3.0s\nAction: wretched object_3 object_5 object_6 object_1\n- Preconditions verified at start:\n  - sneeze(object_3)\n  - texture(object_5)\n  - texture(object_6)\n  - stupendous(object_1)\n  - next(object_3, object_5)  (still present until this step)\n  - collect(object_5, object_1)\n  - collect(object_6, object_1)\n- Effects (applied at completion):\n  - Added: next(object_3, object_6)\n  - Removed: next(object_3, object_5)\n- Notes: This moves the “next” pointer from object_5 to object_6 for object_3.\n\nStep 4 — t=3.0s → 4.0s\nAction: tightfisted object_9 object_3 object_6\n- Preconditions verified at start:\n  - hand(object_9)\n  - sneeze(object_3)\n  - texture(object_6)\n  - next(object_3, object_6)  (added in step 3)\n  - vase(object_9, object_3)  (added in step 1)\n- Effects (applied at completion):\n  - Added: next(object_9, object_6)\n  - Removed: vase(object_9, object_3)\n- Notes: object_9 gains next→object_6; the intermediate vase(object_9,object_3) is consumed/removed.\n\nStep 5 — t=4.0s → 5.0s\nAction: tightfisted object_10 object_3 object_6\n- Preconditions verified at start:\n  - hand(object_10)\n  - sneeze(object_3)\n  - texture(object_6)\n  - next(object_3, object_6)  (still present)\n  - vase(object_10, object_3)  (added in step 2)\n- Effects (applied at completion):\n  - Added: next(object_10, object_6)\n  - Removed: vase(object_10, object_3)\n- Notes: object_10 gains next→object_6; vase(object_10,object_3) is removed.\n\nFinal state relevant facts (summary):\n- next(object_9, object_6) — present (added step 4)\n- next(object_10, object_6) — present (added step 5)\n- next(object_3, object_6) — present (added step 3)\n- next(object_9, object_5) — removed (step 1)\n- next(object_10, object_5) — removed (step 2)\n- next(object_3, object_5) — removed (step 3)\n- vase(object_9, object_3) — added then removed (steps 1 and 4)\n- vase(object_10, object_3) — added then removed (steps 2 and 5)\n\nGoal satisfaction:\n- The required goals (next object_10 object_6) and (next object_9 object_6) are both true after step 5. Plan completed successfully. Total reported duration: 5.0s; cost = 5.",
