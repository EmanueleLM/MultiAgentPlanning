Step 1 — (consonant-move-from-table-to-block b c)
- Time: 2025-10-17T12:00:00Z (t = 0 s)
- Acting agent: consonant_agent
- Action: Move block B from the table onto block C.
- Duration (recorded): 1 s
- Notes: B is a consonant block and was clear on the table; C was clear. This move is permitted for the consonant agent.

Step 2 — (vowel-move-from-table-to-block a b)
- Time: 2025-10-17T12:00:01Z (t = 1 s)
- Acting agent: vowel_agent
- Action: Move block A from the table onto block B.
- Duration (recorded): 1 s
- Notes: A is a vowel block and was clear on the table; B became clear on top after Step 1. This move is permitted for the vowel agent.

Result after these steps:
- A is on B, B is on C (and the rest of the tall stack remains C on D on E on F on G on H on I on J with J on the table).
- Plan cost: 2 (unit cost).
