Summary: execute the two actions in the plan using the vowel_agent to build the final stack A on B on C ... J. Total (unit) cost = 2.

Step 1 — 0.0 to 1.0 (duration 1.0)
- Action: vowel_agent picks up block A from the table.
- Description: vowel_agent performs vowel_pickup_table(A).
- Preconditions satisfied: A is on the table, A is clear, and vowel_agent's hand is empty; A is a vowel block.
- Effects: vowel_agent is now holding A; A is no longer on the table and no longer clear; vowel_agent's hand is no longer empty.

Step 2 — 1.0 to 2.0 (duration 1.0)
- Action: vowel_agent stacks block A onto block B.
- Description: vowel_agent performs vowel_stack(A, B).
- Preconditions satisfied at start of the step: vowel_agent is holding A, B is clear, and A is a vowel block.
- Effects: A is now on B (on A B); A becomes clear; B is no longer clear; vowel_agent's hand becomes empty and is no longer holding A.

Result after these two steps: A is on B, and the remainder of the original stack (B on C on ... on J with J on the table) is preserved, achieving the goal stack A on B on C on D on E on F on G on H on I on J with J on the table.

Total cost: 2 (unit cost per action).
