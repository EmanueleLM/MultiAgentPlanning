Plan (32 steps). Each step lists: time (t = seconds, 1s per action), agent, action description (move source → destination). All steps follow the provided plan exactly. Total cost = 32 (unit cost).

1. t=0s (duration 1s) — consonant_agent: Move block L from on N → onto block I.
2. t=1s (duration 1s) — consonant_agent: Move block N from on G → to table place GOAL.
3. t=2s (duration 1s) — consonant_agent: Move block G from on C → to table place T1.
4. t=3s (duration 1s) — consonant_agent: Move block C from on H → to table place T2.
5. t=4s (duration 1s) — consonant_agent: Move block H from on K → onto block C.
6. t=5s (duration 1s) — consonant_agent: Move block K from on M → onto block L.
7. t=6s (duration 1s) — consonant_agent: Move block M from on F → onto block N.
8. t=7s (duration 1s) — consonant_agent: Move block G from on T1 → onto block H.
9. t=8s (duration 1s) — consonant_agent: Move block F from on STACK1 → onto block G.
10. t=9s (duration 1s) — consonant_agent: Move block K from on L → onto block F.

12. t=11s (duration 1s) — consonant_agent: Move block K from on F → onto block L.
13. t=12s (duration 1s) — vowel_agent: Move block I from on A → to table place STACK1.
14. t=13s (duration 1s) — vowel_agent: Move block A from on E → onto block I.
15. t=14s (duration 1s) — vowel_agent: Move block E from on B → onto block F.
16. t=15s (duration 1s) — vowel_agent: Move block A from on I → onto block B.
17. t=16s (duration 1s) — vowel_agent: Move block A from on B → to table place T1.
18. t=17s (duration 1s) — consonant_agent: Move block B from on J → onto block E.
19. t=18s (duration 1s) — consonant_agent: Move block J from on D → onto block K.
20. t=19s (duration 1s) — vowel_agent: Move block I from on STACK1 → onto block J.
21. t=20s (duration 1s) — consonant_agent: Move block B from on E → to table place STACK1.
22. t=21s (duration 1s) — vowel_agent: Move block E from on F → to table place T3.
23. t=22s (duration 1s) — consonant_agent: Move block F from on G → to table place T4.
24. t=23s (duration 1s) — consonant_agent: Move block G from on H → to table place T5.
25. t=24s (duration 1s) — consonant_agent: Move block H from on C → onto block I.
26. t=25s (duration 1s) — consonant_agent: Move block G from on T5 → onto block H.
27. t=26s (duration 1s) — consonant_agent: Move block F from on T4 → onto block G.
28. t=27s (duration 1s) — vowel_agent: Move block E from on T3 → onto block F.
29. t=28s (duration 1s) — consonant_agent: Move block D from on STACK2 → onto block E.
30. t=29s (duration 1s) — consonant_agent: Move block C from on T2 → onto block D.
31. t=30s (duration 1s) — consonant_agent: Move block B from on STACK1 → onto block C.
32. t=31s (duration 1s) — vowel_agent: Move block A from on T1 → onto block B.

Final note: After executing these 32 moves the plan achieves the target single stack (bottom→top) on GOAL: N, M, L, K, J, I, H, G, F, E, D, C, B, A (with A clear). Total cost = 32.
