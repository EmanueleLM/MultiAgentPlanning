Assumption: actions are listed in the same order as the plan and executed sequentially. I report a simple timestamp assuming each action takes 1.0 s (start inclusive, end exclusive). Agents: vowel_agent (moves A, E, I) and consonant_agent (moves B, C, D, F, G, H, J).

1. [t=0.0s–1.0s] consonant_agent — pickup-cons-from-block B from I.  
2. [t=1.0s–2.0s] vowel_agent — pickup-vowel-from-block I from C.  
3. [t=2.0s–3.0s] consonant_agent — put-cons-on-block B onto C.  
4. [t=3.0s–4.0s] consonant_agent — pickup-cons-from-block D from J.  
5. [t=4.0s–5.0s] vowel_agent — put-vowel-on-block I onto J.

12. [t=11.0s–12.0s] consonant_agent — put-cons-on-table G (place G on the table).  
13. [t=12.0s–13.0s] consonant_agent — pickup-cons-from-table D (pick D from the table).  
14. [t=13.0s–14.0s] consonant_agent — put-cons-on-block D onto E.  
15. [t=14.0s–15.0s] vowel_agent — pickup-vowel-from-block A from B.  
16. [t=15.0s–16.0s] consonant_agent — pickup-cons-from-block B from C.  
17. [t=16.0s–17.0s] consonant_agent — put-cons-on-table B (place B on the table).  
18. [t=17.0s–18.0s] vowel_agent — put-vowel-on-block A onto B.  
19. [t=18.0s–19.0s] consonant_agent — pickup-cons-from-block C from H.  
20. [t=19.0s–20.0s] consonant_agent — put-cons-on-block C onto D.  
21. [t=20.0s–21.0s] consonant_agent — pickup-cons-from-block H from F.  
22. [t=21.0s–22.0s] consonant_agent — put-cons-on-block H onto I.  
23. [t=22.0s–23.0s] consonant_agent — pickup-cons-from-table G (pick G from the table).  
24. [t=23.0s–24.0s] consonant_agent — put-cons-on-block G onto H.  
25. [t=24.0s–25.0s] consonant_agent — pickup-cons-from-table F (pick F from the table).  
26. [t=25.0s–26.0s] consonant_agent — put-cons-on-block F onto G.  
27. [t=26.0s–27.0s] consonant_agent — pickup-cons-from-block C from D.  
28. [t=27.0s–28.0s] consonant_agent — put-cons-on-table C (place C on the table).  
29. [t=28.0s–29.0s] consonant_agent — pickup-cons-from-block D from E.  
30. [t=29.0s–30.0s] vowel_agent — pickup-vowel-from-table E (pick E from the table).  
31. [t=30.0s–31.0s] vowel_agent — put-vowel-on-block E onto F.  
32. [t=31.0s–32.0s] consonant_agent — put-cons-on-block D onto E.  
33. [t=32.0s–33.0s] consonant_agent — pickup-cons-from-table C (pick C from the table).  
34. [t=33.0s–34.0s] consonant_agent — put-cons-on-block C onto D.  
35. [t=34.0s–35.0s] vowel_agent — pickup-vowel-from-block A from B.  
36. [t=35.0s–36.0s] consonant_agent — pickup-cons-from-table B (pick B from the table).  
37. [t=36.0s–37.0s] consonant_agent — put-cons-on-block B onto C.  
38. [t=37.0s–38.0s] vowel_agent — put-vowel-on-block A onto B.

Final state after step 38: the tower A on B on C on D on E on F on G on H on I on J with J on the table — goal achieved.
