Summary: the following 27 steps exactly follow the provided plan. Each step shows the performing agent, the block moved, the source (block or table), and the destination (block or table). Timestamps are illustrative (1 second per action) to show ordering and durations.

1. t=0s — Consonant agent: move D from on top of J and place D onto E.
2. t=1s — Consonant agent: move C from the table and place C onto D.
3. t=2s — Consonant agent: move J from on top of B and place J onto the table.
4. t=3s — Consonant agent: move B from on top of I and place B onto C.
5. t=4s — Vowel agent: move I from the table and place I onto J.
6. t=5s — Consonant agent: move B from on top of C and place B onto the table.
7. t=6s — Consonant agent: move C from on top of D and place C onto the table.
8. t=7s — Consonant agent: move B from the table and place B onto C.
9. t=8s — Consonant agent: move D from on top of E and place D onto the table.
10. t=9s — Vowel agent: move E from on top of A and place E onto F.
11. t=10s — Vowel agent: move A from on top of H and place A onto B.
12. t=11s — Consonant agent: move H from the table and place H onto I.
13. t=12s — Vowel agent: move E from on top of F and place E onto the table.
14. t=13s — Consonant agent: move D from the table and place D onto E.
15. t=14s — Consonant agent: move F from on top of G and place F onto the table.
16. t=15s — Consonant agent: move G from the table and place G onto H.
17. t=16s — Consonant agent: move F from the table and place F onto G.
18. t=17s — Consonant agent: move D from on top of E and place D onto the table.
19. t=18s — Vowel agent: move E from the table and place E onto F.
20. t=19s — Consonant agent: move D from the table and place D onto E.
21. t=20s — Vowel agent: move A from on top of B and place A onto the table.
22. t=21s — Consonant agent: move B from on top of C and place B onto the table.
23. t=22s — Vowel agent: move A from the table and place A onto B.
24. t=23s — Consonant agent: move C from the table and place C onto D.
25. t=24s — Vowel agent: move A from on top of B and place A onto the table.
26. t=25s — Consonant agent: move B from the table and place B onto C.
27. t=26s — Vowel agent: move A from the table and place A onto B.

Resulting final stack (bottom → top): J on table, I on J, H on I, G on H, F on G, E on F, D on E, C on D, B on C, A on B — matches the specified goal.
