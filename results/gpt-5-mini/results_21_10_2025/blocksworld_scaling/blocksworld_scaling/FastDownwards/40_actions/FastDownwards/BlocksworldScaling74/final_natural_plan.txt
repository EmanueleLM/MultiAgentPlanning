Total actions: 43 (unit cost 43).

Note: All actions are labeled by the agent that is allowed to move that block under the specification (vowel agent moves A, E, I; consonant agent moves B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K). The sequence above reproduces the PDDL plan actions exactly (including actions that place a block onto itself as specified in the plan). Final goal intended by the plan: stack A on B, B on C, C on D, D on E, E on F, F on G, G on H, H on I, I on J, J on K, with K on the table.
