19) t=18.0 → 19.0 — Consonant agent: pick up block H from on top of F.
20) t=19.0 → 20.0 — Consonant agent: put block H on top of I.
21) t=20.0 → 21.0 — Consonant agent: pick up block G from the table.
22) t=21.0 → 22.0 — Consonant agent: put block G on top of H.
23) t=22.0 → 23.0 — Consonant agent: pick up block F from on top of D.
24) t=23.0 → 24.0 — Consonant agent: put block F on top of G.

27) t=26.0 → 27.0 — Vowel agent: put block E on top of F.
28) t=27.0 → 28.0 — Consonant agent: put block D on top of E.
29) t=28.0 → 29.0 — Vowel agent: pick up block A from on top of B.
30) t=29.0 → 30.0 — Consonant agent: pick up block B from on top of C.
31) t=30.0 → 31.0 — Consonant agent: put block B down on the table.
32) t=31.0 → 32.0 — Vowel agent: put block A on top of B.
33) t=32.0 → 33.0 — Consonant agent: pick up block C from the table.
34) t=33.0 → 34.0 — Consonant agent: put block C on top of D.
35) t=34.0 → 35.0 — Vowel agent: pick up block A from on top of B.
