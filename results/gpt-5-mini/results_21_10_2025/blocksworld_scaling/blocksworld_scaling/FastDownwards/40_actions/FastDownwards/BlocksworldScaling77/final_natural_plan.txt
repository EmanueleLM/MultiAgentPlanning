Plan executed as a sequence of 22 steps (each step duration = 1 time unit). Timestamps show start–end for each action; the named agent performs the action.

1. [t=00:00–00:01] Consonant agent — Move F from on top of B to on top of G.
2. [t=00:01–00:02] Consonant agent — Move B from on top of J to the table.
3. [t=00:02–00:03] Vowel agent — Move A from the table to on top of B.
4. [t=00:03–00:04] Consonant agent — Move H from on top of K to the table.
5. [t=00:04–00:05] Consonant agent — Move J from on top of D to on top of K.
6. [t=00:05–00:06] Vowel agent — Move I from the table to on top of J.
7. [t=00:06–00:07] Consonant agent — Move F from on top of G to the table.
8. [t=00:07–00:08] Consonant agent — Move G from on top of C to on top of H.
9. [t=00:08–00:09] Consonant agent — Move C from on top of I to on top of D.
10. [t=00:09–00:10] Consonant agent — Move F from the table to on top of G.
11. [t=00:10–00:11] Consonant agent — Move C from on top of D to the table.
12. [t=00:11–00:12] Consonant agent — Move B from the table to on top of C.
13. [t=00:12–00:13] Vowel agent — Move I from on top of J to the table.
14. [t=00:13–00:14] Consonant agent — Move H from the table to on top of I.
15. [t=00:14–00:15] Consonant agent — Move J from on top of K to the table.
16. [t=00:15–00:16] Vowel agent — Move I from the table to on top of J.
17. [t=00:16–00:17] Consonant agent — Move K from on top of E to the table.
18. [t=00:17–00:18] Vowel agent — Move E from on top of L to on top of F.
19. [t=00:18–00:19] Consonant agent — Move D from on top of A to on top of E.
20. [t=00:19–00:20] Consonant agent — Move C from the table to on top of D.
21. [t=00:20–00:21] Consonant agent — Move J from the table to on top of K.
22. [t=00:21–00:22] Consonant agent — Move K from the table to on top of L.

Result: final stacking achieves the goal (A on B, B on C, C on D, D on E, E on F, F on G, G on H, H on I, I on J, J on K, K on L, and L on the table). Total cost = 22.
