Below is a human-readable, step-by-step rendering of the provided plan. Each step matches exactly one action from the plan (same order, no additions or deletions). I indicate the acting agent (vowel_agent for move-vowel..., consonant_agent for move-consonant...), the concrete move (which block is moved, from where to where), and a short note about the top-block precondition. I include a simple timestamp for each step (starting 00:00:00, 1s per step) as an explicit duration indicator.

Summary:
- All steps executed exactly as in the provided plan (47 actions).
- Each vowel move is attributed to vowel_agent and each consonant move to consonant_agent, and each step notes the top-block/destination-clear precondition that the specification requires.
- Total plan cost reported in original plan: 47 (unit cost).
- Total indicated duration (1s per action): 00:00:47 (approximate, for readability).
