Step 40 (t=39s→40s): vowel_agent moves block A from table1 to on B.

Result: after these 40 steps the agents have produced the target descending stack (from table4 upward): L on table4, K on L, J on K, I on J, H on I, G on H, F on G, E on F, D on E, C on D, B on C, A on B — meeting the specified goal. All actions are labeled by the agent that performed them and respect the agents' movement restrictions (vowel_agent moved only A, E, I; consonant_agent moved only consonants) and the “top-only, one-block-at-a-time” constraint.
