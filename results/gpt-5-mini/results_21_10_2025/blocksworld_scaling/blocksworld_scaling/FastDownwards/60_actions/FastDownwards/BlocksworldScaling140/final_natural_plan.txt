Below is a clear, step-by-step, human-readable execution of the provided plan. Steps are listed in order and match the plan exactly (no actions added or removed). I give a simple timestamping convention: actions start at time t=0 and each action takes 1 time unit. Agents are named explicitly.

Initial stacks (for reference before step 1):
- Table D: D - A - H - G - J - F (F is top)
- Table C: C - I - B - E (E is top)

Plan (22 actions). Time shown as [start — end]:

1) [t=0 — t=1] vowel_agent: Move E from on B to on F.
   - Action: vowel-move-block-to-block E (from B) → F

2) [t=1 — t=2] consonant_agent: Move B from on I to the table.
   - Action: consonant-move-block-to-table B (from I) → table

3) [t=2 — t=3] vowel_agent: Move I from on C to the table.
   - Action: vowel-move-block-to-table I (from C) → table

4) [t=3 — t=4] vowel_agent: Move E from on F to the table.
   - Action: vowel-move-block-to-table E (from F) → table

5) [t=4 — t=5] consonant_agent: Move F from on J to on B.
   - Action: consonant-move-block-to-block F (from J) → B

6) [t=5 — t=6] consonant_agent: Move J from on G to the table.
   - Action: consonant-move-block-to-table J (from G) → table

7) [t=6 — t=7] consonant_agent: Move F from on B to on G.
   - Action: consonant-move-block-to-block F (from B) → G

8) [t=7 — t=8] vowel_agent: Move I from the table to on J.
   - Action: vowel-move-table-to-block I (from table) → J

9) [t=8 — t=9] consonant_agent: Move F from on G to the table.
   - Action: consonant-move-block-to-table F (from G) → table

10) [t=9 — t=10] vowel_agent: Move E from the table to on F.
    - Action: vowel-move-table-to-block E (from table) → F

11) [t=10 — t=11] consonant_agent: Move G from on H to on B.
    - Action: consonant-move-block-to-block G (from H) → B

12) [t=11 — t=12] consonant_agent: Move H from on A to on I.
    - Action: consonant-move-block-to-block H (from A) → I

13) [t=12 — t=13] consonant_agent: Move G from on B to on H.
    - Action: consonant-move-block-to-block G (from B) → H

14) [t=13 — t=14] vowel_agent: Move A from on D to on B.
    - Action: vowel-move-block-to-block A (from D) → B

15) [t=14 — t=15] vowel_agent: Move E from on F to on C.
    - Action: vowel-move-block-to-block E (from F) → C

16) [t=15 — t=16] consonant_agent: Move F from the table to on G.
    - Action: consonant-move-table-to-block F (from table) → G

17) [t=16 — t=17] vowel_agent: Move E from on C to on F.
    - Action: vowel-move-block-to-block E (from C) → F

18) [t=17 — t=18] consonant_agent: Move D from the table to on E.
    - Action: consonant-move-table-to-block D (from table) → E

19) [t=18 — t=19] consonant_agent: Move C from the table to on D.
    - Action: consonant-move-table-to-block C (from table) → D

20) [t=19 — t=20] vowel_agent: Move A from on B to the table.
    - Action: vowel-move-block-to-table A (from B) → table

21) [t=20 — t=21] consonant_agent: Move B from the table to on C.
    - Action: consonant-move-table-to-block B (from table) → C

22) [t=21 — t=22] vowel_agent: Move A from the table to on B.
    - Action: vowel-move-table-to-block A (from table) → B

Result (final stack after step 22):
- Single stack on the table: J (ontable), I on J, H on I, G on H, F on G, E on F, D on E, C on D, B on C, A on B. Top A is clear.

Total plan cost / duration: 22 time units (22 actions, unit cost each).

Notes:
- Agent role constraints respected in each action: vowel_agent moved only A, E, I; consonant_agent moved only B, C, D, F, G, H, J.
- Each action description follows the semantic meaning of the PDDL action names: "move X from Y to Z" with Y either a block or "table" and Z either a block or "table".
