Assumptions / name mappings (for clarity)
- The plan uses short place names "piles", "pilel", "pilec". These map to the problem places as:
  - "piles" -> pileS (the empty table spot called pileS in the problem)
  - "pilel" -> pileL
  - "pilec" -> pileC
- Each step below follows the plan exactly (no additions or deletions). Where the plan used lowercase names, I show canonical block/place names matching the problem (blocks A..M; places pileC, pileL, pileS).
- Agent performing each step is inferred from the PDDL action name: move-vowel-* actions are by the vowel_agent (A, E, I); move-consonant-* actions are by the consonant_agent (others).
- Timestamping: I give a simple timeline starting at 00:00:00 with fixed 10-second duration per action (timestamp indicates action start). This provides a consistent duration when possible.

Notes
- Each step above corresponds exactly (in order and intent) to the action sequence in the supplied PDDL plan. I preserved each move and only translated internal place names to the canonical place names used in the PDDL problem (listed in the assumptions).
- Agent labels (vowel_agent / consonant_agent) follow the action name (move-vowel-* → vowel_agent, move-consonant-* → consonant_agent), consistent with the specification.
