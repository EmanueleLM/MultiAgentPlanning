Step 1 — Orchestrator schedules the meeting:
- Action (PDDL): orchestrator-schedule s1430
- Human-readable: The orchestrator schedules a 30-minute meeting on Monday from 14:30 to 15:00 with Roy, Kathryn, and Amy.
- Duration / timestamp: 14:30–15:00 (30 minutes)
- Justification: Roy, Kathryn, and Amy are all available at this slot and Amy's preference marks 14:30–15:00 as acceptable/preferred, so the meeting satisfies all participants' calendars and constraints.
- Outcome: meeting is scheduled (goal achieved).
