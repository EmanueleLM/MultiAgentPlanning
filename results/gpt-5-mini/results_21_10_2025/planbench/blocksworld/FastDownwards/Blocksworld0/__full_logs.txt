PROBLEM
------------------------------
I am playing with a set of blocks where I need to arrange the blocks into stacks. Here are the actions I can do

Pick up a block
Unstack a block from on top of another block
Put down a block
Stack a block on top of another block

I have the following restrictions on my actions:
I can only pick up or unstack one block at a time.
I can only pick up or unstack a block if my hand is empty.
I can only pick up a block if the block is on the table and the block is clear. A block is clear if the block has no other blocks on top of it and if the block is not picked up.
I can only unstack a block from on top of another block if the block I am unstacking was really on top of the other block.
I can only unstack a block from on top of another block if the block I am unstacking is clear.
Once I pick up or unstack a block, I am holding the block.
I can only put down a block that I am holding.
I can only stack a block on top of another block if I am holding the block being stacked.
I can only stack a block on top of another block if the block onto which I am stacking the block is clear.
Once I put down or stack a block, my hand becomes empty.
Once you stack a block on top of a second block, the second block is no longer clear.

[STATEMENT]
As initial conditions I have that, the red block is clear, the blue block is clear, the yellow block is clear, the hand is empty, the blue block is on top of the orange block, the red block is on the table, the orange block is on the table and the yellow block is on the table.
My goal is to have that the orange block is on top of the blue block.

My plan is as follows:

[PLAN]
unstack the blue block from on top of the orange block
put down the blue block
pick up the orange block
stack the orange block on top of the blue block
[PLAN END]

NATURAL-PLAN sas_plan_1
------------------------------
Summary: Execute the provided 4-step plan exactly as given. All steps are performed by agent block_player1. Assigning simple unit durations for readability (each step = 1 time unit). Total cost = 4.

Initial symbolic state (from the problem):
- on(blue, orange)
- ontable(red)
- ontable(orange)
- ontable(yellow)
- clear(red)
- clear(blue)
- clear(yellow)
- handempty

Plan (human-readable, with preconditions, effects, timestamps)

Step 1 — t = 0.0 → 1.0 (duration 1.0)
Action: unstack_p1(blue, orange) — block_player1 unstack the blue block from on top of the orange block.
- Preconditions (checked before action): handempty; on(blue, orange); clear(blue).
- Effects (applied after action): holding(blue); clear(orange); not on(blue, orange); not handempty; not clear(blue).
- State change notes: blue is removed from orange and is now held by the agent. Orange becomes clear.

Step 2 — t = 1.0 → 2.0 (duration 1.0)
Action: putdown_p1(blue) — block_player1 put down the blue block onto the table.
- Preconditions: holding(blue).
- Effects: ontable(blue); handempty; clear(blue); not holding(blue).
- State change notes: blue is placed on the table and the agent’s hand becomes empty.

Step 3 — t = 2.0 → 3.0 (duration 1.0)
Action: pickup_p1(orange) — block_player1 pick up the orange block from the table.
- Preconditions: handempty; ontable(orange); clear(orange).
- Effects: holding(orange); not ontable(orange); not handempty; not clear(orange).
- State change notes: orange is lifted into the agent’s hand.

Step 4 — t = 3.0 → 4.0 (duration 1.0)
Action: stack_p1(orange, blue) — block_player1 stack the orange block on top of the blue block.
- Preconditions: holding(orange); clear(blue).
- Effects: on(orange, blue); handempty; clear(orange); not holding(orange); not clear(blue).
- State change notes: orange is placed on top of blue; the agent’s hand becomes empty.

Final symbolic state (relevant predicates):
- on(orange, blue)  ← goal achieved
- ontable(red)
- ontable(blue)
- ontable(yellow)
- clear(red)
- clear(orange)
- handempty
- not holding any block

Goal check: The final state satisfies the goal (on orange blue). Total plan cost: 4 (unit cost per action).

Assumptions / notes:
- All preconditions were satisfied at each step given the initial state and the effects of prior steps; no missing information needed to validate the plan.
- Each action is attributed to block_player1 (as in the domain action names with suffix _p1).
