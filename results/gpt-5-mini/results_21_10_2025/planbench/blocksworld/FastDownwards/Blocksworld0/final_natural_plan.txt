Summary: Execute the provided 4-step plan exactly as given. All steps are performed by agent block_player1. Assigning simple unit durations for readability (each step = 1 time unit). Total cost = 4.

Initial symbolic state (from the problem):
- on(blue, orange)
- ontable(red)
- ontable(orange)
- ontable(yellow)
- clear(red)
- clear(blue)
- clear(yellow)
- handempty

Plan (human-readable, with preconditions, effects, timestamps)

Step 1 — t = 0.0 → 1.0 (duration 1.0)
Action: unstack_p1(blue, orange) — block_player1 unstack the blue block from on top of the orange block.
- Preconditions (checked before action): handempty; on(blue, orange); clear(blue).
- Effects (applied after action): holding(blue); clear(orange); not on(blue, orange); not handempty; not clear(blue).
- State change notes: blue is removed from orange and is now held by the agent. Orange becomes clear.

Step 2 — t = 1.0 → 2.0 (duration 1.0)
Action: putdown_p1(blue) — block_player1 put down the blue block onto the table.
- Preconditions: holding(blue).
- Effects: ontable(blue); handempty; clear(blue); not holding(blue).
- State change notes: blue is placed on the table and the agent’s hand becomes empty.

Step 3 — t = 2.0 → 3.0 (duration 1.0)
Action: pickup_p1(orange) — block_player1 pick up the orange block from the table.
- Preconditions: handempty; ontable(orange); clear(orange).
- Effects: holding(orange); not ontable(orange); not handempty; not clear(orange).
- State change notes: orange is lifted into the agent’s hand.

Step 4 — t = 3.0 → 4.0 (duration 1.0)
Action: stack_p1(orange, blue) — block_player1 stack the orange block on top of the blue block.
- Preconditions: holding(orange); clear(blue).
- Effects: on(orange, blue); handempty; clear(orange); not holding(orange); not clear(blue).
- State change notes: orange is placed on top of blue; the agent’s hand becomes empty.

Final symbolic state (relevant predicates):
- on(orange, blue)  ← goal achieved
- ontable(red)
- ontable(blue)
- ontable(yellow)
- clear(red)
- clear(orange)
- handempty
- not holding any block

Goal check: The final state satisfies the goal (on orange blue). Total plan cost: 4 (unit cost per action).

Assumptions / notes:
- All preconditions were satisfied at each step given the initial state and the effects of prior steps; no missing information needed to validate the plan.
- Each action is attributed to block_player1 (as in the domain action names with suffix _p1).
