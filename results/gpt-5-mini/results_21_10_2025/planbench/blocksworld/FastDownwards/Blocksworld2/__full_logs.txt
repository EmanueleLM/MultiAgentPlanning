PROBLEM
------------------------------
I am playing with a set of blocks where I need to arrange the blocks into stacks. Here are the actions I can do

Pick up a block
Unstack a block from on top of another block
Put down a block
Stack a block on top of another block

I have the following restrictions on my actions:
I can only pick up or unstack one block at a time.
I can only pick up or unstack a block if my hand is empty.
I can only pick up a block if the block is on the table and the block is clear. A block is clear if the block has no other blocks on top of it and if the block is not picked up.
I can only unstack a block from on top of another block if the block I am unstacking was really on top of the other block.
I can only unstack a block from on top of another block if the block I am unstacking is clear.
Once I pick up or unstack a block, I am holding the block.
I can only put down a block that I am holding.
I can only stack a block on top of another block if I am holding the block being stacked.
I can only stack a block on top of another block if the block onto which I am stacking the block is clear.
Once I put down or stack a block, my hand becomes empty.
Once you stack a block on top of a second block, the second block is no longer clear.

[STATEMENT]
As initial conditions I have that, the blue block is clear, the hand is empty, the blue block is on top of the orange block, the orange block is on top of the yellow block, the yellow block is on top of the red block and the red block is on the table.
My goal is to have that the red block is on top of the orange block and the yellow block is on top of the red block.

My plan is as follows:

[PLAN]
unstack the blue block from on top of the orange block
put down the blue block
unstack the orange block from on top of the yellow block
put down the orange block
unstack the yellow block from on top of the red block
stack the yellow block on top of the blue block
pick up the red block
stack the red block on top of the orange block
unstack the yellow block from on top of the blue block
stack the yellow block on top of the red block
[PLAN END]

NATURAL-PLAN sas_plan_1
------------------------------
Plan execution timeline (agent: player1). Each action is executed sequentially, 1.0s duration per action (timestamps shown as start–end). After each step I list the principal effects on the world state.

Step 1 — t=0.0s–1.0s
Action: unstack player1 blue from orange
Preconditions met: blue is on orange, blue is clear, player1’s hand is empty.
Effects: player1 is holding blue; blue is no longer on orange; orange becomes clear; player1’s hand is no longer empty.

Step 2 — t=1.0s–2.0s
Action: put-down player1 blue
Preconditions met: player1 is holding blue.
Effects: blue is placed on the table (OnTable blue); blue becomes clear; player1’s hand becomes empty; player1 is no longer holding blue.

Step 3 — t=2.0s–3.0s
Action: unstack player1 orange from yellow
Preconditions met: orange is on yellow, orange is clear, player1’s hand is empty.
Effects: player1 is holding orange; orange is no longer on yellow; yellow becomes clear; player1’s hand is no longer empty.

Step 4 — t=3.0s–4.0s
Action: put-down player1 orange
Preconditions met: player1 is holding orange.
Effects: orange is placed on the table (OnTable orange); orange becomes clear; player1’s hand becomes empty; player1 is no longer holding orange.

Step 5 — t=4.0s–5.0s
Action: unstack player1 yellow from red
Preconditions met: yellow is on red, yellow is clear, player1’s hand is empty.
Effects: player1 is holding yellow; yellow is no longer on red; red becomes clear; player1’s hand is no longer empty.

Step 6 — t=5.0s–6.0s
Action: put-down player1 yellow
Preconditions met: player1 is holding yellow.
Effects: yellow is placed on the table (OnTable yellow); yellow becomes clear; player1’s hand becomes empty; player1 is no longer holding yellow.

Step 7 — t=6.0s–7.0s
Action: pick-up player1 red
Preconditions met: red is on the table and clear, player1’s hand is empty.
Effects: player1 is holding red; red is no longer OnTable; player1’s hand is no longer empty; red is not clear while held.

Step 8 — t=7.0s–8.0s
Action: stack player1 red on orange
Preconditions met: player1 is holding red, orange is clear.
Effects: red is placed on orange (On red orange); orange is no longer clear; red becomes clear; player1’s hand becomes empty; player1 is no longer holding red.

Step 9 — t=8.0s–9.0s
Action: pick-up player1 yellow
Preconditions met: yellow is on the table and clear, player1’s hand is empty.
Effects: player1 is holding yellow; yellow is no longer OnTable; player1’s hand is no longer empty; yellow is not clear while held.

Step 10 — t=9.0s–10.0s
Action: stack player1 yellow on red
Preconditions met: player1 is holding yellow, red is clear.
Effects: yellow is placed on red (On yellow red); red is no longer clear; yellow becomes clear; player1’s hand becomes empty; player1 is no longer holding yellow.

Final state summary (after t=10.0s):
- On red orange (red directly on orange)
- On yellow red (yellow directly on red)
- blue is on the table and clear
- orange has red on top? (orange is under red; orange is not clear)
- player1’s hand is empty

Goal verification:
- Goal from the specification for this run (player1): On red orange AND On yellow red — both are satisfied.

Plan cost: 10 (unit cost), total duration 10.0s.
