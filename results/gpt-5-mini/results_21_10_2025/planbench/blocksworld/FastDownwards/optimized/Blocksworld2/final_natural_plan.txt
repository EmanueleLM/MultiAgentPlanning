1) Time 0 → 1 (duration 1 time unit)
   Action: vowel_agent picks up block A from the table.
   - Corresponds to PDDL action: (vowel-pickup-table A)
   - Preconditions satisfied: A is a vowel, A is on the table, A is clear, vowel_agent's hand is empty.

2) Time 1 → 2 (duration 1 time unit)
   Action: vowel_agent stacks block A onto block B (places A on top of B).
   - Corresponds to PDDL action: (vowel-stack A B)
   - Preconditions satisfied: vowel_agent is holding A, B is clear.

Final state after these steps:
- A is on B, and the rest of the initial stack relations remain (B on C, C on D, D on E, E on F, F on G, G on H, H on I, I on J, and J on the table), so the overall goal is achieved.
Total plan cost: 2 (two actions, each unit cost).
