Every action meets the preconditions given the state at that time, and the plan achieves the goal.\n\nBrief step-by-step check (high level)\n- Unstack blue from red \u2014 allowed (blue is clear, on red, hand empty). Now holding blue; red becomes clear.\n- Put down blue \u2014 allowed. Blue on table, hand empty.\n- Unstack red from orange \u2014 allowed (red is clear now, on orange, hand empty). Now holding red; orange becomes clear.\n- Put down red \u2014 allowed. Red on table, hand empty.\n- Pick up yellow \u2014 allowed (yellow is on table and clear).\n- Stack yellow on orange \u2014 allowed (orange is clear).\n- Pick up blue \u2014 allowed (blue is on table and clear).\n- Stack blue on yellow \u2014 allowed (yellow is clear).\n- Pick up red \u2014 allowed (red on table and clear).\n- Stack red on blue \u2014 allowed (blue is clear).\n\nFinal configuration after the plan: red on blue, blue on yellow, yellow on orange (hand empty). That matches your goal.\n\nSecond goal \u2014 produce a plan\n\nInitial state (again): blue on red on orange, orange on table, yellow on table, blue and yellow clear, hand empty.\nGoal: red on orange AND yellow on blue.\n\nNote: red is already on orange in the initial state; the only missing condition is yellow on top of blue. Blue is currently clear (it has nothing on top), and yellow is on the table and clear. So a minimal valid plan is:\n\n1. pick up the yellow block\n2. stack the yellow block on top of the blue block\n\nBoth actions satisfy the preconditions and after them the state will be:\n- yellow on blue, blue on red, red on orange \u2014 so red on orange and yellow on blue are true.
