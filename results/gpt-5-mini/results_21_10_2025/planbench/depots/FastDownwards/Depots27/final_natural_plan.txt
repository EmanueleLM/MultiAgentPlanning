Final state (after Time 24.0)
- The plan finishes with the intended goal relations established:
  - next(object_12,object_6)
  - next(object_13,object_10)
  - next(object_14,object_11)
- All actions and parameters match the provided plan exactly. Each step above reports the preconditions required and the effects produced, in the same order as the supplied plan.
