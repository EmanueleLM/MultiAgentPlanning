Plan (human-readable, step-by-step). Each action is executed by player1. Assume actions start at time 0 and take 1 time unit each.

1) Time 0 → 1 (duration 1)
   Action: player1 performs p1-sip(object_8, object_1, object_6)
   Description: Using hand object_8 with cats object_1 and texture object_6, produce vase(object_8,object_1). Effect: add vase(object_8,object_1); remove next(object_8,object_6).

2) Time 1 → 2 (duration 1)
   Action: player1 performs p1-sip(object_7, object_1, object_6)
   Description: Using hand object_7 with cats object_1 and texture object_6, produce vase(object_7,object_1). Effect: add vase(object_7,object_1); remove next(object_7,object_6).

3) Time 2 → 3 (duration 1)
   Action: player1 performs p1-memory(object_1, object_6, object_5)
   Description: Using cats object_1 and springs object_6 & object_5, move the "next" link from object_1→object_6 to object_1→object_5. Effect: add next(object_1,object_5); remove next(object_1,object_6).

4) Time 3 → 4 (duration 1)
   Action: player1 performs p1-paltry(object_8, object_1, object_5)
   Description: With hand object_8, cats object_1, texture object_5 and vase(object_8,object_1), create next(object_8,object_5) and consume the vase. Effect: add next(object_8,object_5); remove vase(object_8,object_1).

5) Time 4 → 5 (duration 1)
   Action: player1 performs p1-paltry(object_7, object_1, object_5)
   Description: With hand object_7, cats object_1, texture object_5 and vase(object_7,object_1), create next(object_7,object_5) and consume the vase. Effect: add next(object_7,object_5); remove vase(object_7,object_1).

6) Time 5 → 6 (duration 1)
   Action: player1 performs p1-memory(object_0, object_6, object_7)
   Description: Using cats object_0 and springs object_6 & object_7, move the "next" link from object_0→object_6 to object_0→object_7. Effect: add next(object_0,object_7); remove next(object_0,object_6).

7) Time 6 → 7 (duration 1)
   Action: player1 performs p1-sip(object_9, object_0, object_7)
   Description: Using hand object_9 with cats object_0 and texture object_7, produce vase(object_9,object_0). Effect: add vase(object_9,object_0); remove next(object_9,object_7).

8) Time 7 → 8 (duration 1)
   Action: player1 performs p1-memory(object_0, object_7, object_6)
   Description: Using cats object_0 and springs object_7 & object_6, move the "next" link from object_0→object_7 back to object_0→object_6. Effect: add next(object_0,object_6); remove next(object_0,object_7).

9) Time 8 → 9 (duration 1)
   Action: player1 performs p1-paltry(object_9, object_0, object_6)
   Description: With hand object_9, cats object_0, texture object_6 and vase(object_9,object_0), create next(object_9,object_6) and consume the vase. Effect: add next(object_9,object_6); remove vase(object_9,object_0).

Summary: After these 9 steps (total time 9 units), the required goal facts are achieved:
- next(object_7,object_5) (created at step 5)
- next(object_8,object_5) (created at step 4)
- next(object_8,object_7) (remained true from the initial state)
- next(object_9,object_6) (created at step 9)

Total plan cost/time: 9 units.
