Below is a human-readable, step-by-step execution of the provided plan. Each step lists the action, its parameter objects, the timestamp (assumed unit duration = 1 per action), the preconditions that are satisfied at that moment, and the direct effects (facts added and removed). The plan follows the given sequence exactly (6 actions, total cost 6) and achieves the goal (next object_10 object_6).

Initial facts (relevant ones used by the plan)
- cats: object_0, object_1
- hand: object_10
- sneeze: object_4, object_5
- spring: object_6, object_8
- stupendous: object_2, object_3
- texture: object_6, object_7, object_8, object_9
- collect: (object_6,object_2), (object_7,object_2), (object_8,object_3), (object_9,object_3)
- next: (object_0,object_8), (object_1,object_6), (object_10,object_9), (object_4,object_6), (object_5,object_9)

Plan (unit time per action)

Step 1 — time 0.0 -> 1.0
Action: clip object_10 object_5 object_9
- Preconditions satisfied at start of step:
  - (hand object_10)
  - (sneeze object_5)
  - (texture object_9)
  - (next object_5 object_9)
  - (next object_10 object_9)
- Effects (applied at end of step):
  - Added: (vase object_10 object_5)
  - Removed: (next object_10 object_9)
Notes: This creates a vase relation between object_10 and object_5 and clears the previous next link from object_10 to object_9.

Step 2 — time 1.0 -> 2.0
Action: wretched object_5 object_9 object_8 object_3
- Parameters mapping: sn=object_5, t1=object_9, t2=object_8, s=object_3
- Preconditions satisfied at start of step:
  - (sneeze object_5)
  - (texture object_9)
  - (texture object_8)
  - (stupendous object_3)
  - (next object_5 object_9)
  - (collect object_9 object_3)
  - (collect object_8 object_3)
- Effects (applied at end of step):
  - Added: (next object_5 object_8)
  - Removed: (next object_5 object_9)
Notes: Redirects the “next” link for object_5 from object_9 to object_8.

Step 3 — time 2.0 -> 3.0
Action: tightfisted object_10 object_5 object_8
- Parameters mapping: h=object_10, sn=object_5, t=object_8
- Preconditions satisfied at start of step:
  - (hand object_10)
  - (sneeze object_5)
  - (texture object_8)
  - (next object_5 object_8)  — created by Step 2
  - (vase object_10 object_5)  — created by Step 1
- Effects (applied at end of step):
  - Added: (next object_10 object_8)
  - Removed: (vase object_10 object_5)
Notes: Moves the “next” link for object_10 to object_8 and removes the vase between object_10 and object_5.

Step 4 — time 3.0 -> 4.0
Action: sip object_10 object_0 object_8
- Parameters mapping: h=object_10, c=object_0, t=object_8
- Preconditions satisfied at start of step:
  - (hand object_10)
  - (cats object_0)
  - (texture object_8)
  - (next object_10 object_8)  — created by Step 3
  - (next object_0 object_8)   — present in initial facts
- Effects (applied at end of step):
  - Added: (vase object_10 object_0)
  - Removed: (next object_10 object_8)
Notes: Establishes a vase relation between object_10 and object_0 and clears the next link from object_10 to object_8.

Step 5 — time 4.0 -> 5.0
Action: memory object_0 object_8 object_6
- Parameters mapping: c=object_0, s1=object_8, s2=object_6
- Preconditions satisfied at start of step:
  - (cats object_0)
  - (spring object_8)
  - (spring object_6)
  - (next object_0 object_8)  — still present (not removed by prior steps)
- Effects (applied at end of step):
  - Added: (next object_0 object_6)
  - Removed: (next object_0 object_8)
Notes: Redirects object_0’s next link from object_8 to object_6.

Step 6 — time 5.0 -> 6.0
Action: paltry object_10 object_0 object_6
- Parameters mapping: h=object_10, c=object_0, t=object_6
- Preconditions satisfied at start of step:
  - (hand object_10)
  - (cats object_0)
  - (texture object_6)
  - (vase object_10 object_0)  — created by Step 4
  - (next object_0 object_6)   — created by Step 5
- Effects (applied at end of step):
  - Added: (next object_10 object_6)
  - Removed: (vase object_10 object_0)
Notes: This is the final action that produces the goal link.

Goal check (after Step 6, time 6.0)
- Goal required: (next object_10 object_6)
- Current facts include: (next object_10 object_6) — achieved by Step 6.
- Plan cost: 6 (unit cost per action)

Conclusion: Executing the actions in the exact order given (clip, wretched, tightfisted, sip, memory, paltry), with each action taking one time unit, results in (next object_10 object_6) becoming true at time 6.0, satisfying the goal.
