Below is a human-readable, step-by-step presentation of the given plan. Each step follows the plan exactly, shows a simple timestamp (1 time unit per action), and lists the immediate effects in terms of added and removed atomic facts (predicates). Preconditions required by each action are satisfied by the initial facts and/or effects of earlier steps as needed (see notes at the end). The final goal is reached after the last step.

Time unit = 1. Start time t = 0.

1) t = 0 → 1 — wretched object_5 object_8 object_9 object_3
   - Meaning: for object_5, change its successor from object_8 to object_9 (uses object_3 as the stupendous target).
   - Effects:
     - Added: (next object_5 object_9)
     - Removed: (next object_5 object_8)

2) t = 1 → 2 — clip object_10 object_5 object_9
   - Meaning: object_10 forms a vase relation with object_5; object_10 stops pointing to object_9.
   - Effects:
     - Added: (vase object_10 object_5)
     - Removed: (next object_10 object_9)

3) t = 2 → 3 — wretched object_4 object_7 object_6 object_2
   - Meaning: for object_4, change its successor from object_7 to object_6 (uses object_2 as stupendous).
   - Effects:
     - Added: (next object_4 object_6)
     - Removed: (next object_4 object_7)

4) t = 3 → 4 — sip object_12 object_0 object_6
   - Meaning: object_12 forms a vase relation with object_0 and stops pointing to object_6.
   - Effects:
     - Added: (vase object_12 object_0)
     - Removed: (next object_12 object_6)

5) t = 4 → 5 — sip object_11 object_0 object_6
   - Meaning: object_11 forms a vase relation with object_0 and stops pointing to object_6.
   - Effects:
     - Added: (vase object_11 object_0)
     - Removed: (next object_11 object_6)

6) t = 5 → 6 — wretched object_5 object_9 object_8 object_3
   - Meaning: for object_5, change its successor from object_9 back to object_8 (uses object_3 as stupendous).
   - Effects:
     - Added: (next object_5 object_8)
     - Removed: (next object_5 object_9)

7) t = 6 → 7 — tightfisted object_10 object_5 object_8
   - Meaning: object_10 takes the successor that object_5 has (object_8) and the vase relation to object_5 is removed.
   - Effects:
     - Added: (next object_10 object_8)
     - Removed: (vase object_10 object_5)

8) t = 7 → 8 — sip object_10 object_1 object_8
   - Meaning: object_10 forms a vase with object_1 and stops pointing to object_8.
   - Effects:
     - Added: (vase object_10 object_1)
     - Removed: (next object_10 object_8)

9) t = 8 → 9 — memory object_1 object_8 object_6
   - Meaning: for object_1, change its successor from object_8 to object_6.
   - Effects:
     - Added: (next object_1 object_6)
     - Removed: (next object_1 object_8)

10) t = 9 → 10 — paltry object_10 object_1 object_6
    - Meaning: using the vase (object_10, object_1) and successor of object_1 (object_6), object_10 now points to object_6; the vase (object_10,object_1) is removed.
    - Effects:
      - Added: (next object_10 object_6)
      - Removed: (vase object_10 object_1)

11) t = 10 → 11 — clip object_10 object_4 object_6
    - Meaning: object_10 forms a vase with object_4 and stops pointing to object_6.
    - Effects:
      - Added: (vase object_10 object_4)
      - Removed: (next object_10 object_6)

12) t = 11 → 12 — wretched object_4 object_6 object_7 object_2
    - Meaning: for object_4, change its successor from object_6 back to object_7.
    - Effects:
      - Added: (next object_4 object_7)
      - Removed: (next object_4 object_6)

13) t = 12 → 13 — tightfisted object_10 object_4 object_7
    - Meaning: object_10 takes the successor of object_4 (object_7); the vase (object_10,object_4) is removed.
    - Effects:
      - Added: (next object_10 object_7)
      - Removed: (vase object_10 object_4)

14) t = 13 → 14 — memory object_0 object_6 object_8
    - Meaning: for object_0, change its successor from object_6 to object_8.
    - Effects:
      - Added: (next object_0 object_8)
      - Removed: (next object_0 object_6)

15) t = 14 → 15 — paltry object_12 object_0 object_8
    - Meaning: object_12 uses its vase to object_0 to take object_0’s successor (object_8); the vase (object_12,object_0) is removed.
    - Effects:
      - Added: (next object_12 object_8)
      - Removed: (vase object_12 object_0)

16) t = 15 → 16 — paltry object_11 object_0 object_8
    - Meaning: object_11 uses its vase to object_0 to take object_0’s successor (object_8); the vase (object_11,object_0) is removed.
    - Effects:
      - Added: (next object_11 object_8)
      - Removed: (vase object_11 object_0)

17) t = 16 → 17 — clip object_11 object_5 object_8
    - Meaning: object_11 forms a vase with object_5 and stops pointing to object_8.
    - Effects:
      - Added: (vase object_11 object_5)
      - Removed: (next object_11 object_8)

18) t = 17 → 18 — wretched object_5 object_8 object_9 object_3
    - Meaning: for object_5, change its successor from object_8 to object_9 once more.
    - Effects:
      - Added: (next object_5 object_9)
      - Removed: (next object_5 object_8)

19) t = 18 → 19 — tightfisted object_11 object_5 object_9
    - Meaning: object_11 takes the successor of object_5 (object_9); the vase (object_11,object_5) is removed.
    - Effects:
      - Added: (next object_11 object_9)
      - Removed: (vase object_11 object_5)

Final verification (after t = 19):
- (next object_10 object_7) — established at step 13.
- (next object_11 object_9) — established at step 19.
- (next object_12 object_8) — established at step 15.

These three facts match the required goal:
- next object_10 object_7
- next object_11 object_9
- next object_12 object_8

Notes:
- Each step above corresponds exactly to the corresponding action in the provided plan, in the same order.
- Each action’s reported added/removed atoms follow the action schemas in the domain:
  - paltry / memory / wretched / tightfisted change a "next" relation (add new next, remove old next),
  - sip / clip / paltry / tightfisted create or delete "vase" relations as specified.
- Preconditions required by every action (such as the presence of (next ...), (vase ...), (sneeze ...), (hand ...), (texture ...), (stupendous ...), (collect ...) or (spring ...)) are satisfied by the initial state and/or by earlier actions in the sequence; the plan as executed above reaches the final goal.
