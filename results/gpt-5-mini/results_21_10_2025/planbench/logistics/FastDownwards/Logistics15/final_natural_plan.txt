Below is a human-readable, step-by-step execution of the provided PDDL plan. Each step matches exactly one plan action in order. I give a timestamp (start time in integer units, duration = 1 unit), the action with its arguments, the instantiated preconditions and where they come from (initial facts or prior step that produced them), the instantiated add and delete effects, and a short note that the preconditions are satisfied at execution time.

Final check (after Step 22)
Requested goal facts:
- next(object_10, object_6) — produced in Step 18
- next(object_11, object_7) — produced in Step 22
- next(object_12, object_7) — produced in Step 21
- next(object_9, object_6) — produced in Step 17

All four goal facts are present after executing Step 22. The sequence above follows the provided PDDL plan exactly (22 actions), lists each action with time stamps (unit durations), and indicates where preconditions originate and which effects establish intermediate and final facts.
