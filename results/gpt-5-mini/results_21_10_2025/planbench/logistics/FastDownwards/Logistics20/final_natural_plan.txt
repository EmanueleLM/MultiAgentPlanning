Plan (8 steps, unit cost each). I list each step with a timestamp (start time in time units), the exact action from the plan, which agent (when clear from suffix _a), the key preconditions checked at that time, and the effect (facts added / deleted). All steps are exactly those from the provided plan and executed sequentially (time increases by 1 per step).

Time 0 — Step 1
Action: (wretched_a object_4 object_10 object_11 object_3)
Agent: playerA (wretched_a)
Preconditions (checked at time 0):
- (sneeze object_4) — present
- (texture object_10) — present
- (texture object_11) — present
- (stupendous object_3) — present
- (next object_4 object_10) — present
- (collect object_10 object_3) — present
- (collect object_11 object_3) — present
All preconditions satisfied.
Effects:
- Add: (next object_4 object_11)
- Delete: (next object_4 object_10)

Time 1 — Step 2
Action: (wretched_a object_4 object_7 object_10 object_2)
Agent: playerA (wretched_a)
Preconditions (checked at time 1):
- (sneeze object_4) — present
- (texture object_7) — present
- (texture object_10) — present
- (stupendous object_2) — present
- (next object_4 object_7) — present (from merged init)
- (collect object_7 object_2) — present
- (collect object_10 object_2) — present
All preconditions satisfied.
Effects:
- Add: (next object_4 object_10)
- Delete: (next object_4 object_7)

Time 2 — Step 3
Action: (clip_a object_12 object_4 object_10)
Agent: playerA (clip_a)
Preconditions (checked at time 2):
- (hand object_12) — present
- (sneeze object_4) — present
- (texture object_10) — present
- (next object_4 object_10) — present (added by Step 2)
- (next object_12 object_10) — present (from merged init)
All preconditions satisfied.
Effects:
- Add: (vase object_12 object_4)
- Delete: (next object_12 object_10)

Time 3 — Step 4
Action: (tightfisted_a object_12 object_4 object_11)
Agent: playerA (tightfisted_a)
Preconditions (checked at time 3):
- (hand object_12) — present
- (sneeze object_4) — present
- (texture object_11) — present
- (next object_4 object_11) — present (added by Step 1)
- (vase object_12 object_4) — present (added by Step 3)
All preconditions satisfied.
Effects:
- Add: (next object_12 object_11)   ← This achieves goal (next object_12 object_11)
- Delete: (vase object_12 object_4)

Time 4 — Step 5
Action: (memory object_1 object_9 object_8)
Agent: generic/public action (memory)
Preconditions (checked at time 4):
- (cats object_1) — present
- (spring object_9) — present
- (spring object_8) — present
- (next object_1 object_9) — present (from merged init)
All preconditions satisfied.
Effects:
- Add: (next object_1 object_8)
- Delete: (next object_1 object_9)

Time 5 — Step 6
Action: (sip object_11 object_1 object_8)
Agent: generic/public action (sip)
Preconditions (checked at time 5):
- (hand object_11) — present
- (cats object_1) — present
- (texture object_8) — present
- (next object_11 object_8) — present (from merged init)
- (next object_1 object_8) — present (added by Step 5)
All preconditions satisfied.
Effects:
- Add: (vase object_11 object_1)
- Delete: (next object_11 object_8)

Time 6 — Step 7
Action: (memory object_1 object_8 object_9)
Agent: generic/public action (memory)
Preconditions (checked at time 6):
- (cats object_1) — present
- (spring object_8) — present
- (spring object_9) — present
- (next object_1 object_8) — present (added by Step 5; not deleted since)
All preconditions satisfied.
Effects:
- Add: (next object_1 object_9)
- Delete: (next object_1 object_8)

Time 7 — Step 8
Action: (paltry object_11 object_1 object_9)
Agent: generic/public action (paltry)
Preconditions (checked at time 7):
- (hand object_11) — present
- (cats object_1) — present
- (texture object_9) — present
- (vase object_11 object_1) — present (added by Step 6)
- (next object_1 object_9) — present (added by Step 7)
All preconditions satisfied.
Effects:
- Add: (next object_11 object_9)   ← This achieves goal (next object_11 object_9)
- Delete: (vase object_11 object_1)

Final outcome (after Step 8):
- Both requested goal facts are true:
  - (next object_11 object_9) — added in Step 8
  - (next object_12 object_11) — added in Step 4
- All intermediate preconditions were satisfied at their step times; no steps failed.

Timing summary:
- 8 sequential steps executed at times 0..7, each duration 1 time unit (unit-cost actions).
- Final goals reached at time 3 (next object_12 object_11) and time 7 (next object_11 object_9).

This human-readable action sequence exactly follows the provided PDDL plan and demonstrates how the merged initial facts and public action schemas produce the two goal facts.
