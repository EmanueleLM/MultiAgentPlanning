Summary assumptions
- Each action is executed in sequence and is assumed to take 1 time unit (this matches the plan cost = 18).  
- Time is shown as intervals [t=K .. t=K+1) where step 1 runs at [0..1), step 2 at [1..2), … step 18 at [17..18).  
- For each step I list the action, the parameter objects (exactly as in the plan), the preconditions that must hold at that time (taken from the domain), and the effects (added and deleted ground predicates).

- Effects: add (vase object_11 object_0); delete (next object_11 object_8)

13) [t=12 .. 13)  memory object_0 object_8 object_5

14) [t=13 .. 14)  paltry object_12 object_0 object_5

- Effects: add (next object_12 object_5); delete (vase object_12 object_0)
- Note: This step creates (next object_12 object_5) — one of the required goals. It becomes true at t in [13..14).

15) [t=14 .. 15)  paltry object_11 object_0 object_5
- Preconditions: (hand object_11), (cats object_0), (texture object_5), (vase object_11 object_0), (next object_0 object_5)

- Effects: add (next object_11 object_7); delete (vase object_11 object_3)
- Note: This step creates (next object_11 object_7) — the other required goal. It becomes true at t in [17..18).

Final status and goals
- Total elapsed time: 18 time units (steps 1..18).
- Goal predicates required by the problem:
  - (next object_11 object_7) — achieved at step 18 (t in [17..18)).
  - (next object_12 object_5) — achieved at step 14 (t in [13..14)).
- Both goal predicates are true at the end of the execution (after t = 18). The provided action sequence exactly matches the plan and is consistent with the domain preconditions/effects.
