Plan (sequence of actions, timestamps and effects). Each action duration: 1.0s (timestamps increment by 1.0s).

Step 1 — t=0.0s — (clip object_12 object_5 object_11)
- Natural language: Use object_12 with object_5 (sneeze) and texture object_11 to perform clip.
- Preconditions (assumed satisfied at this moment): hand object_12, sneeze object_5, texture object_11, next object_5 object_11, next object_12 object_11.
- Effects: add (vase object_12 object_5); delete (next object_12 object_11).

Step 2 — t=1.0s — (wretched object_3 object_7 object_6 object_1)
- Natural language: Apply wretched using object_3 (sneeze), moving relation from object_7 to object_6 with support of stupendous object_1.
- Preconditions: sneeze object_3, texture object_7, texture object_6, stupendous object_1, next object_3 object_7, collect object_7 object_1, collect object_6 object_1.
- Effects: add (next object_3 object_6); delete (next object_3 object_7).

Step 3 — t=2.0s — (clip object_11 object_3 object_6)
- Natural language: Use object_11 with object_3 (sneeze) and texture object_6 to perform clip.
- Preconditions: hand object_11, sneeze object_3, texture object_6, next object_3 object_6, next object_11 object_6.
- Effects: add (vase object_11 object_3); delete (next object_11 object_6).

Step 4 — t=3.0s — (wretched object_3 object_6 object_7 object_1)
- Natural language: Apply wretched using object_3 (sneeze), moving relation from object_6 to object_7 with stupendous object_1.
- Preconditions: sneeze object_3, texture object_6, texture object_7, stupendous object_1, next object_3 object_6, collect object_6 object_1, collect object_7 object_1.
- Effects: add (next object_3 object_7); delete (next object_3 object_6).

Step 5 — t=4.0s — (clip object_13 object_3 object_7)
- Natural language: Use object_13 with object_3 (sneeze) and texture object_7 to perform clip.
- Preconditions: hand object_13, sneeze object_3, texture object_7, next object_3 object_7, next object_13 object_7.
- Effects: add (vase object_13 object_3); delete (next object_13 object_7).

Step 6 — t=5.0s — (tightfisted object_11 object_3 object_7)
- Natural language: Use object_11 with object_3 (sneeze) and texture object_7 to perform tightfisted.
- Preconditions: hand object_11, sneeze object_3, texture object_7, next object_3 object_7, vase object_11 object_3.
- Effects: add (next object_11 object_7); delete (vase object_11 object_3).
- Note: This step produces the goal fact (next object_11 object_7).

Step 7 — t=6.0s — (wretched object_3 object_7 object_9 object_2)
- Natural language: Apply wretched using object_3 (sneeze), moving relation from object_7 to object_9 with stupendous object_2.
- Preconditions: sneeze object_3, texture object_7, texture object_9, stupendous object_2, next object_3 object_7, collect object_7 object_2, collect object_9 object_2.
- Effects: add (next object_3 object_9); delete (next object_3 object_7).

Step 8 — t=7.0s — (tightfisted object_13 object_3 object_9)
- Natural language: Use object_13 with object_3 (sneeze) and texture object_9 to perform tightfisted.
- Preconditions: hand object_13, sneeze object_3, texture object_9, next object_3 object_9, vase object_13 object_3.
- Effects: add (next object_13 object_9); delete (vase object_13 object_3).
- Note: This step produces the goal fact (next object_13 object_9).

Step 9 — t=8.0s — (clip object_12 object_4 object_10)
- Natural language: Use object_12 with object_4 (sneeze) and texture object_10 to perform clip.
- Preconditions: hand object_12, sneeze object_4, texture object_10, next object_4 object_10, next object_12 object_10.
- Effects: add (vase object_12 object_4); delete (next object_12 object_10).

Step 10 — t=9.0s — (tightfisted object_12 object_4 object_8)
- Natural language: Use object_12 with object_4 (sneeze) and texture object_8 to perform tightfisted.
- Preconditions: hand object_12, sneeze object_4, texture object_8, next object_4 object_8, vase object_12 object_4.
- Effects: add (next object_12 object_8); delete (vase object_12 object_4).
- Note: This step produces the goal fact (next object_12 object_8).

Step 11 — t=10.0s — (wretched object_5 object_11 object_10 object_3)
- Natural language: Apply wretched using object_5 (sneeze), moving relation from object_11 to object_10 with stupendous object_3.
- Preconditions: sneeze object_5, texture object_11, texture object_10, stupendous object_3, next object_5 object_11, collect object_11 object_3, collect object_10 object_3.
- Effects: add (next object_5 object_10); delete (next object_5 object_11).

Step 12 — t=11.0s — (tightfisted object_12 object_5 object_10)
- Natural language: Use object_12 with object_5 (sneeze) and texture object_10 to perform tightfisted.
- Preconditions: hand object_12, sneeze object_5, texture object_10, next object_5 object_10, vase object_12 object_5.
- Effects: add (next object_12 object_10); delete (vase object_12 object_5).
- Note: This step produces the goal fact (next object_12 object_10).

Final state (after t=12.0s):
- The combined goal predicates are achieved:
  - (next object_11 object_7) — produced at step 6.
  - (next object_12 object_8) — produced at step 10.
  - (next object_12 object_10) — produced at step 12.
  - (next object_13 object_9) — produced at step 8.

End of plan.
