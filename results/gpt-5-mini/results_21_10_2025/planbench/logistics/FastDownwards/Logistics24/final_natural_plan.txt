Plan execution timeline (each action = 1 time unit). I step the given plan exactly in order, check that required preconditions are present at the time of the action, and report the effects (what facts are added and deleted).

Initial relevant facts (from the problem):
- unary: hand: object_12, object_13. cats: object_0, object_1. sneeze: object_4, object_5. spring: object_6, object_9. stupendous: object_2, object_3. texture: object_6,7,8,9,10,11.
- collect relations: (collect object_10 object_3), (collect object_11 object_3), (collect object_6 object_2), (collect object_7 object_2), (collect object_8 object_2), (collect object_9 object_3).
- next relations: (next object_0 object_9), (next object_1 object_9), (next object_12 object_11), (next object_13 object_7), (next object_4 object_8), (next object_5 object_11).
- No vase relations initially.

Step 1 — t = 0 → 1
Action: clip object_12 object_5 object_11
- Preconditions required: (hand object_12), (sneeze object_5), (texture object_11), (next object_5 object_11), (next object_12 object_11).
- Preconditions present? Yes (all present in initial state).
- Effects: add (vase object_12 object_5); delete (next object_12 object_11).
- State change summary: (vase 12,5) created; (next 12,11) removed.

Step 2 — t = 1 → 2
Action: wretched object_5 object_11 object_10 object_3
- Preconditions required: (sneeze object_5), (texture object_11), (texture object_10), (stupendous object_3), (next object_5 object_11), (collect object_11 object_3), (collect object_10 object_3).
- Preconditions present? Yes ((next 5,11) remained after Step 1).
- Effects: add (next object_5 object_10); delete (next object_5 object_11).
- State change summary: (next 5,10) created; (next 5,11) removed.

Step 3 — t = 2 → 3

- Preconditions present? Yes ((next 5,10) added in Step 2; (vase 12,5) from Step 1).
- Effects: add (next object_12 object_10); delete (vase object_12 object_5).
- State change summary: (next 12,10) created — this satisfies one part of the goal; (vase 12,5) removed.

- Preconditions required: (sneeze object_4), (texture object_8), (texture object_6), (stupendous object_2), (next object_4 object_8), (collect object_8 object_2), (collect object_6 object_2).

- Effects: add (next object_4 object_6); delete (next object_4 object_8).
- State change summary: (next 4,6) created; (next 4,8) removed.

Step 5 — t = 4 → 5
Action: wretched object_4 object_6 object_7 object_2
- Preconditions required: (sneeze object_4), (texture object_6), (texture object_7), (stupendous object_2), (next object_4 object_6), (collect object_6 object_2), (collect object_7 object_2).
- Preconditions present? Yes ((next 4,6) added in Step 4).
- Effects: add (next object_4 object_7); delete (next object_4 object_6).
- State change summary: (next 4,7) created; (next 4,6) removed.

Step 6 — t = 5 → 6
Action: clip object_13 object_4 object_7
- Preconditions required: (hand object_13), (sneeze object_4), (texture object_7), (next object_4 object_7), (next object_13 object_7).
- Preconditions present? Yes ((next 4,7) from Step 5; next 13,7 was in initial state).
- Effects: add (vase object_13 object_4); delete (next object_13 object_7).
- State change summary: (vase 13,4) created; (next 13,7) removed.

Step 7 — t = 6 → 7
Action: wretched object_4 object_7 object_6 object_2
- Preconditions required: (sneeze object_4), (texture object_7), (texture object_6), (stupendous object_2), (next object_4 object_7), (collect object_7 object_2), (collect object_6 object_2).
- Preconditions present? Yes ((next 4,7) still present until this step).
- Effects: add (next object_4 object_6); delete (next object_4 object_7).
- State change summary: (next 4,6) re-created; (next 4,7) removed.

Step 8 — t = 7 → 8
Action: tightfisted object_13 object_4 object_6
- Preconditions required: (hand object_13), (sneeze object_4), (texture object_6), (next object_4 object_6), (vase object_13 object_4).

- Effects: add (next object_13 object_6); delete (vase object_13 object_4).
- State change summary: (next 13,6) created; (vase 13,4) removed.

Step 9 — t = 8 → 9
Action: memory object_0 object_9 object_6
- Preconditions required: (cats object_0), (spring object_9), (spring object_6), (next object_0 object_9).
- Preconditions present? Yes ((next 0,9) was in initial state; springs and cats present).
- Effects: add (next object_0 object_6); delete (next object_0 object_9).
- State change summary: (next 0,6) created; (next 0,9) removed.

Step 10 — t = 9 → 10
Action: sip object_13 object_0 object_6
- Preconditions required: (hand object_13), (cats object_0), (texture object_6), (next object_13 object_6), (next object_0 object_6).
- Preconditions present? Yes ((next 13,6) from Step 8; next 0,6 from Step 9).
- Effects: add (vase object_13 object_0); delete (next object_13 object_6).
- State change summary: (vase 13,0) created; (next 13,6) removed.

Step 11 — t = 10 → 11
Action: memory object_0 object_6 object_9
- Preconditions required: (cats object_0), (spring object_6), (spring object_9), (next object_0 object_6).
- Preconditions present? Yes ((next 0,6) created in Step 9).
- Effects: add (next object_0 object_9); delete (next object_0 object_6).
- State change summary: (next 0,9) re-created; (next 0,6) removed.

Step 12 — t = 11 → 12
Action: paltry object_13 object_0 object_9
- Preconditions required: (hand object_13), (cats object_0), (texture object_9), (vase object_13 object_0), (next object_0 object_9).
- Preconditions present? Yes (vase 13,0 from Step 10; next 0,9 from Step 11).
- Effects: add (next object_13 object_9); delete (vase object_13 object_0).
- State change summary: (next 13,9) created; (vase 13,0) removed.

Final outcome (after t = 12)
- (next object_12 object_10) — created at Step 3 and not deleted later — present.
- (next object_13 object_9) — created at Step 12 — present.
- Both parts of the goal are satisfied:
  - next object_12 object_10: achieved at Step 3 (t=2→3).
  - next object_13 object_9: achieved at Step 12 (t=11→12).

Notes
- Every step in the given plan was applicable when executed (preconditions satisfied at each time).
- The plan uses only the domain actions listed and only modifies predicates those actions specify (next and vase).
- Each step was reported with a 1-unit duration and a start/end timestamp as requested. If you prefer different time units or non-uniform durations, I can re-report with those assumptions.
