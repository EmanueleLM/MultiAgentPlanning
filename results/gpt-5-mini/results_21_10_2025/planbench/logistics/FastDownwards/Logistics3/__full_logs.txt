FINAL-PLAN
------------------------------
I don't have the agents' structured action models or the initial state — those inputs are required to produce a correct merged PDDL domain + problem. Please provide the action-model summaries (for paltry_agent, sip_agent, clip_agent, wretched_agent, memory_agent, and tightfisted_agent) and the initial-state facts. Each agent's model should include:

- action name(s) and parameter list(s)
- natural-language description of preconditions and effects (or a list of predicate names used)
- any constraints or hard preferences that must be encoded as hard constraints
- any predicates introduced by that agent (with intended arities and types)

Also provide the initial facts (objects and initial predicates) you want used in the problem (or confirm I should invent them). The goal you specified is: next object_8 object_6 — I will use that as the problem goal.

If helpful, you can paste each agent in this simple structured form:

paltry_agent:
- actions:
  - move(obj ?o ?from ?to): pre: at ?o ?from, clear ?to. eff: not (at ?o ?from), (at ?o ?to)
  - ...
- predicates: at(?o - object ?l - loc), clear(?l - loc), ...

When you provide those, I'll:
- reconcile predicate naming conflicts and document the renamings as comments inside the PDDL
- keep each agent's action names distinct (prefixing with agent name if needed)
- produce a single domain (with :requirements limited to :strips, :typing, :negative-preconditions) and a FastDownwards-compatible problem (objects, initial state, goal)
- enclose the domain in <domain></domain> and the problem in <problem></problem>

If you want, I can also create a plausible example domain+problem now (inventing missing details) so you can review the format; tell me whether to invent the agents' actions and initial facts or provide the real inputs.

NATURAL-PLAN sas_plan_1
------------------------------
1) Time 0.0 → 1.0 — Action: sip(object_8, object_1, object_7)
   - Preconditions checked (all true in the initial state VariantB):
     - hand object_8
     - cats object_1
     - texture object_7
     - next object_8 object_7
     - next object_1 object_7
   - Effects applied:
     - Add: vase object_8 object_1
     - Delete: next object_8 object_7
   - Relevant resulting facts after step:
     - vase object_8 object_1 (new)
     - next object_8 object_7 (removed)
     - next object_1 object_7 (still true)

2) Time 1.0 → 2.0 — Action: memory(object_1, object_7, object_6)
   - Preconditions checked (true after step 1):
     - cats object_1
     - spring object_7
     - spring object_6
     - next object_1 object_7
   - Effects applied:
     - Add: next object_1 object_6
     - Delete: next object_1 object_7
   - Relevant resulting facts after step:
     - next object_1 object_6 (new)
     - next object_1 object_7 (removed)
     - vase object_8 object_1 (remains from step 1)

3) Time 2.0 → 3.0 — Action: paltry(object_8, object_1, object_6)
   - Preconditions checked (true after step 2):
     - hand object_8
     - cats object_1
     - texture object_6
     - vase object_8 object_1
     - next object_1 object_6
   - Effects applied:
     - Add: next object_8 object_6
     - Delete: vase object_8 object_1
   - Relevant resulting facts after step:
     - next object_8 object_6 (new — this satisfies the goal)
     - vase object_8 object_1 (removed)

Summary
- Executed actions in order exactly as in the plan: sip → memory → paltry.
- Total (unit) cost: 3.
- Final goal (next object_8 object_6) is achieved at Time 3.0.

NATURAL-PLAN sas_plan_1
------------------------------
Plan summary (total cost = 2 units). Two sequential actions, each 1 time unit long:

Step 1 — Time 0.0 → 1.0
- Action: sip object_8 object_0 object_7
- Meaning (human): Using object_8 (in hand) with object_0 (a “cats” object) and object_7 (a “texture” object), perform the sip action relating object_8 and object_0 through object_7.
- Required preconditions (from the domain) and whether they hold in the initial state:
  - hand object_8 — SATISFIED
  - cats object_0 — SATISFIED
  - texture object_7 — SATISFIED
  - next object_8 object_7 — SATISFIED
  - next object_0 object_7 — SATISFIED
- Effects applied when the action executes:
  - Add: vase object_8 object_0
  - Delete: next object_8 object_7
- Derived state changes after Step 1 (delta):
  - Removed: (next object_8 object_7)
  - Added: (vase object_8 object_0)
- Cumulative notable facts after Step 1 (showing only relevant predicates changed or used):
  - vase object_8 object_0 (now true)
  - next object_8 object_7 (now false)
  - other initial facts remain unchanged

Step 2 — Time 1.0 → 2.0
- Action: paltry object_8 object_0 object_6
- Meaning (human): Using object_8 (in hand) with object_0 (a “cats” object) and object_6 (a “texture” object), perform the paltry action to link object_8 to object_6 via object_0.
- Required preconditions (from the domain) and whether they hold at this point:
  - hand object_8 — SATISFIED (from initial)
  - cats object_0 — SATISFIED (from initial)
  - texture object_6 — SATISFIED (from initial)
  - vase object_8 object_0 — SATISFIED (added by Step 1)
  - next object_0 object_6 — SATISFIED (present in the initial facts)
- Effects applied when the action executes:
  - Add: next object_8 object_6
  - Delete: vase object_8 object_0
- Derived state changes after Step 2 (delta):
  - Removed: (vase object_8 object_0)
  - Added: (next object_8 object_6)
- Cumulative notable facts after Step 2:
  - next object_8 object_6 (now true)
  - vase object_8 object_0 (now false)
  - next object_7 object_6 (was already true in the initial state and remains true)

Final check against goals
- Goal: (and (next object_7 object_6) (next object_8 object_6))
  - next object_7 object_6 — TRUE (present in initial state)
  - next object_8 object_6 — TRUE (established by Step 2)
- Conclusion: Both goal conjuncts are satisfied in the final state. The provided plan (sip then paltry) is applicable as given and achieves the combined goal.

PROBLEM
------------------------------
I am playing with a set of objects. Here are the actions I can do

Paltry object_0 object_1 object_2.
Sip object_0 object_1 object_2.
Clip object_0 object_1 object_2.
Wretched object_0 object_1 object_2 object_3.
Memory object_0 object_1 object_2.
Tightfisted object_0 object_1 object_2.

I have the following restrictions on my actions:
To perform paltry action, the following facts need to be true: hand object_0, cats object_1, texture object_2, vase object_0 object_1, and next object_1 object_2
Once paltry is performed the following facts will be true: next object_0 object_2
Once paltry is performed the following facts will be false: vase object_0 object_1
To perform sip action, the following facts need to be true: hand object_0, cats object_1, texture object_2, next object_0 object_2, and next object_1 object_2
Once sip is performed the following facts will be true: vase object_0 object_1
Once sip is performed the following facts will be false: next object_0 object_2

FINAL-PLAN
------------------------------
I can’t produce the requested PDDL domain and problem until you give the three required inputs. Please provide the items below so I can run the full feasibility analysis and then generate FastDownward-compatible PDDL domain and problem files.

Required inputs (please paste them exactly in the indicated form):

1) Private initial facts (the local state) — list of ground atoms currently true, one per line. Example format:
Initial facts:
- at(actor1 loc1)
- at(object_6 loc2)
- clear(object_6)
- free_hands(actor1)
- next(object_2 object_3)

Notes:
- Use predicate syntax with atoms in parentheses and space-separated arguments (no commas).
- Include all facts needed (locations, holding, clear, adjacency, occupied slots, agent capabilities, etc.).
- If you want typed objects, list object names here; I will infer types from predicates or you can supply a type list.

2) The provided plan — ordered list of actions with concrete parameter bindings (one per line). Example format:
Plan:
1. move(actor1 loc1 loc2)
2. pick(actor1 object_7 loc2)
3. place_on(actor1 object_7 object_6)
4. pick(actor1 object_8 loc2)
5. place_on(actor1 object_8 object_6)

Notes:
- Use the exact action names you want modeled (e.g., paltry, sip, clip, wretched, memory, tightfisted if those are the actions to use).
- If there are agents, include which agent performs each action.
- If plan is partial / abstract, mark which steps are high-level and whether you accept me filling in supporting moves.

3) Public action schemas (for every action used in the plan) — give preconditions and effects (add and delete lists). If you don't have formal schemas, give clear plain-English preconditions and effects I can convert. Example format (formal or plain-English both acceptable):
Action schemas (public):
- move(A From To):
  pre: at(A From), path(From To)
  add: at(A To)
  del: at(A From)
- pick(A O Loc):
  pre: at(A Loc), at(O Loc), free_hands(A)
  add: holding(A O)
  del: free_hands(A), at(O Loc)
- place_on(A O Target):
  pre: holding(A O), clear(Target), at(A Loc), at(Target Loc)
  add: on(O Target), free_hands(A), clear(O)
  del: holding(A O), clear(Target)

Additional clarifications I need (answer any that apply to your domain; if you don’t answer I’ll ask follow-ups):
- Definition of next(X,Y): Is next symmetric? Is it only valid when two objects are on the same support (same table/loc)? Does placing X adjacent to Y create next(X,Y) immediately?
- Number of agents and hands: single agent or multiple agents? Does each agent have one hand (can hold only one object) or more?
- Movement model: Do we explicitly model agent movement between locations? Are slots or discrete locations used?
- Stack model: Are objects stackable? Is clear(O) required to pick O? Can objects be colocated at a location (multiple objects per location) or only one object per slot?
- Are actions paltry, sip, clip, wretched, memory, tightfisted the canonical action names you want encoded? If yes, for each, provide preconditions/effects or plain-English behavior.

If you prefer, you can instead confirm a set of standard assumptions and I will generate a default blocks-world-like domain and problem. Example default assumptions I can use if you don’t provide full schemas:
- Single agent with one hand
- Objects are on discrete locations (slots) and on/next relations as predicates
- next(X,Y) is symmetric and requires same-loc adjacency
- pick/put/move actions follow the standard STRIPS blocks-world pattern

What I will produce once you supply the three inputs:
- Step-by-step applicability check for each plan step (applicable or not, missing preconditions if any).
- Effects applied at each applicable step (explicit add/delete lists).
- Threats/conflicts: effects that delete facts needed later.
- Suggested minimal corrections (extra actions or reordering).
- A compact revised plan (patch) achieving next(object_7, object_5) and next(object_8, object_5) if that is your goal.
- A FastDownward-compatible PDDL domain (inside <domain>...</domain>) and a PDDL problem (inside <problem>...</problem>) using only :strips, :typing and :negative-preconditions in :requirements as requested. I will preserve your action names (paltry, sip, clip, wretched, memory, tightfisted) if you provide their schemas.

When you’re ready, paste the three items (Initial facts, Plan, Action schemas) using the example format above. If you want me to assume defaults instead of providing full schemas, say which default assumptions to use.

No actions are required for actor1.\n\nActor2: The goal (next object_7 object_5 AND next object_8 object_5) cannot be achieved from the provided initial facts with the available actions. In particular, none of the available actions can introduce the necessary preconditions (such as cats or sneeze on objects 7 or 8, or a vase relationships needed without a circular dependency) to produce next object_7 object_5 and next object_8 object_5. The combined goal (both agents' goals together) is therefore not achievable; the PDDL problem below encodes the domain, initial state and both agents' goals so a planner can verify infeasibility."

In particular, none of the available actions can introduce the necessary preconditions (such as cats or sneeze on objects 7 or 8, or a vase relationships needed without a circular dependency) to produce next object_7 object_5 and next object_8 object_5. The combined goal (both agents' goals together) is therefore not achievable; the PDDL problem below encodes the domain, initial state and both agents' goals so a planner can verify infeasibility."

The combined goal (both agents' goals together) is therefore not achievable; the PDDL problem below encodes the domain, initial state and both agents' goals so a planner can verify infeasibility."

Examination of the public schemas shows every action that can add a next ?x ?z either (a) requires an existing next ?x ?y (possibly with other constraints), or (b) requires cats ?x (for memory). In instance B there is initial next object_9 object_7 (so some actions depending on next object_9 * can be used), and sneeze facts exist for object_4 and object_5 (useful for clip), and hand object_9 is available. A potentially useful action is clip to create vase object_9 object_5 (clip object_9 object_5 object_7 is applicable), but subsequent creation of next object_9 object_6 would still require a vase object_9 ?y together with cats ?y and next ?y object_6 (for paltry) or other combinations that demand cats on the involved object. Instance B lacks cats for the necessary intermediate objects (for example cats for object_5 is missing), and there is no action to create cats. Therefore, no valid action sequence (with the public schemas) can reach next object_9 object_6 from the given initial facts of instance B. In short: instance A \u2014 solvable with the plan above; instance B \u2014 unsolvable given the provided predicates and action schemas (next object_9 object_6 cannot be derived)."

Examination of the public schemas shows every action that can add a next ?x ?z either (a) requires an existing next ?x ?y (possibly with other constraints), or (b) requires cats ?x (for memory). In instance B there is initial next object_9 object_7 (so some actions depending on next object_9 * can be used), and sneeze facts exist for object_4 and object_5 (useful for clip), and hand object_9 is available. A potentially useful action is clip to create vase object_9 object_5 (clip object_9 object_5 object_7 is applicable), but subsequent creation of next object_9 object_6 would still require a vase object_9 ?y together with cats ?y and next ?y object_6 (for paltry) or other combinations that demand cats on the involved object. Instance B lacks cats for the necessary intermediate objects (for example cats for object_5 is missing), and there is no action to create cats. Therefore, no valid action sequence (with the public schemas) can reach next object_9 object_6 from the given initial facts of instance B. In short: instance A \u2014 solvable with the plan above; instance B \u2014 unsolvable given the provided predicates and action schemas (next object_9 object_6 cannot be derived)."

NATURAL-PLAN sas_plan_2
------------------------------
Below is a human-readable, step-by-step execution of the provided PDDL plan. Each step matches the plan exactly, reports a simple timestamp assuming unit duration per action (cost = 1 per step), lists the action’s required preconditions (per the public schemas), indicates whether those preconditions are satisfied at execution time, and states the action effects (added and deleted facts). At the end I confirm that the final goal predicates are satisfied.

Time convention: actions execute sequentially with unit duration. Step k runs from t = k-1 to t = k.

Step 1 — t = 0.0 → 1.0
Action: sip object_8 object_1 object_6
- Parameters: x = object_8, y = object_1, z = object_6
- sip preconditions: (hand x), (cats y), (texture z), (next x z), (next y z)
  - At t=0 these are: hand object_8 (yes), cats object_1 (yes), texture object_6 (yes), next object_8 object_6 (yes), next object_1 object_6 (yes) → ALL satisfied.
- Effects:
  - Adds: (vase object_8 object_1)
  - Deletes: (next object_8 object_6)

Step 2 — t = 1.0 → 2.0
Action: sip object_7 object_1 object_6
- Parameters: x = object_7, y = object_1, z = object_6
- sip preconditions: (hand object_7), (cats object_1), (texture object_6), (next object_7 object_6), (next object_1 object_6)
  - At t=1 these are: hand object_7 (yes), cats object_1 (yes), texture object_6 (yes), next object_7 object_6 (yes), next object_1 object_6 (yes) → ALL satisfied.
- Effects:
  - Adds: (vase object_7 object_1)
  - Deletes: (next object_7 object_6)

Step 3 — t = 2.0 → 3.0
Action: memory object_1 object_6 object_5
- Parameters: x = object_1, y = object_6, z = object_5
- memory preconditions: (cats x), (spring y), (spring z), (next x y)
  - At t=2: cats object_1 (yes), spring object_6 (yes), spring object_5 (yes), next object_1 object_6 (yes) → ALL satisfied.
- Effects:
  - Adds: (next object_1 object_5)
  - Deletes: (next object_1 object_6)

Step 4 — t = 3.0 → 4.0
Action: paltry object_8 object_1 object_5
- Parameters: x = object_8, y = object_1, z = object_5
- paltry preconditions: (hand x), (cats y), (texture z), (vase x y), (next y z)
  - At t=3: hand object_8 (yes), cats object_1 (yes), texture object_5 (yes), vase object_8 object_1 (yes, added in Step 1), next object_1 object_5 (yes, added in Step 3) → ALL satisfied.
- Effects:
  - Adds: (next object_8 object_5)
  - Deletes: (vase object_8 object_1)

Step 5 — t = 4.0 → 5.0
Action: paltry object_7 object_1 object_5
- Parameters: x = object_7, y = object_1, z = object_5
- paltry preconditions: (hand object_7), (cats object_1), (texture object_5), (vase object_7 object_1), (next object_1 object_5)
  - At t=4: hand object_7 (yes), cats object_1 (yes), texture object_5 (yes), vase object_7 object_1 (yes, added in Step 2), next object_1 object_5 (yes) → ALL satisfied.
- Effects:
  - Adds: (next object_7 object_5)
  - Deletes: (vase object_7 object_1)

Step 6 — t = 5.0 → 6.0
Action: memory object_0 object_6 object_7
- Parameters: x = object_0, y = object_6, z = object_7
- memory preconditions: (cats x), (spring y), (spring z), (next x y)
  - At t=5: cats object_0 (yes), spring object_6 (yes), spring object_7 (yes), next object_0 object_6 (yes initial and not deleted so far) → ALL satisfied.
- Effects:
  - Adds: (next object_0 object_7)
  - Deletes: (next object_0 object_6)

Step 7 — t = 6.0 → 7.0
Action: sip object_9 object_0 object_7
- Parameters: x = object_9, y = object_0, z = object_7
- sip preconditions: (hand x), (cats y), (texture z), (next x z), (next y z)
  - At t=6: hand object_9 (yes), cats object_0 (yes), texture object_7 (yes), next object_9 object_7 (yes initial), next object_0 object_7 (yes, added in Step 6) → ALL satisfied.
- Effects:
  - Adds: (vase object_9 object_0)
  - Deletes: (next object_9 object_7)

Step 8 — t = 7.0 → 8.0
Action: memory object_0 object_7 object_6
- Parameters: x = object_0, y = object_7, z = object_6
- memory preconditions: (cats object_0), (spring object_7), (spring object_6), (next object_0 object_7)
  - At t=7: cats object_0 (yes), spring object_7 (yes), spring object_6 (yes), next object_0 object_7 (yes, added in Step 6) → ALL satisfied.
- Effects:
  - Adds: (next object_0 object_6)
  - Deletes: (next object_0 object_7)

Step 9 — t = 8.0 → 9.0
Action: paltry object_9 object_0 object_6
- Parameters: x = object_9, y = object_0, z = object_6
- paltry preconditions: (hand object_9), (cats object_0), (texture object_6), (vase object_9 object_0), (next object_0 object_6)
  - At t=8: hand object_9 (yes), cats object_0 (yes), texture object_6 (yes), vase object_9 object_0 (yes, added in Step 7), next object_0 object_6 (yes, added in Step 8) → ALL satisfied.
- Effects:
  - Adds: (next object_9 object_6)
  - Deletes: (vase object_9 object_0)

Final verification (after t = 9.0)
Goal predicates required:
- (next object_7 object_5) — added in Step 5 and not deleted later → present.
- (next object_8 object_5) — added in Step 4 and not deleted later → present.
- (next object_8 object_7) — present in the combined initial state and never deleted by any step → present.
- (next object_9 object_6) — added in Step 9 → present.

Conclusion: All actions in the provided plan were applicable at the time they were executed (all preconditions were satisfied when each action ran), and their effects produce the required final goal state. The plan executes in 9 time units (9 steps), consistent with the stated cost = 9.
