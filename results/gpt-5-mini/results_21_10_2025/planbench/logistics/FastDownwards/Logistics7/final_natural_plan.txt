Summary
- Plan has 6 actions, each treated as taking 1 time unit (unit cost per action). I show steps at timestamps 0..5 (start of each action). The plan is consistent with the given domain and initial facts, and the final goal (next object_10 object_6) is achieved at the end of step 6. Total cost = 6.

Initial relevant facts (from the problem)
- hand: object_10
- cats: object_0, object_1
- texture: object_6, object_7, object_8, object_9
- sneeze: object_4, object_5
- spring: object_6, object_8
- stupendous: object_2, object_3
- collect: (object_6,object_2), (object_7,object_2), (object_8,object_3), (object_9,object_3)
- next: (object_0,object_8), (object_1,object_6), (object_10,object_9), (object_4,object_6), (object_5,object_9)

Step-by-step execution (timestamps, preconditions checked, effects applied)

Step 1 — t = 0
Action: clip object_10 object_5 object_9
- Action signature: clip(subject, x, y)
- Preconditions required:
  - hand(object_10) — true (initial)
  - sneeze(object_5) — true (initial)
  - texture(object_9) — true (initial)
  - next(object_5, object_9) — true (initial)
  - next(object_10, object_9) — true (initial)
- Effects:
  - ADD vase(object_10, object_5)
  - DELETE next(object_10, object_9)
- State change after Step 1:
  - vase(object_10,object_5) is now true
  - next(object_10,object_9) is removed

Step 2 — t = 1
Action: wretched object_5 object_9 object_8 object_3
- Action signature: wretched(x, y, z, w)
- Preconditions required:
  - sneeze(object_5) — true (initial)
  - texture(object_9) — true (initial)
  - texture(object_8) — true (initial)
  - stupendous(object_3) — true (initial)
  - next(object_5, object_9) — true (initial; still present)
  - collect(object_9, object_3) — true (initial)
  - collect(object_8, object_3) — true (initial)
- Effects:
  - ADD next(object_5, object_8)
  - DELETE next(object_5, object_9)
- State change after Step 2:
  - next(object_5,object_8) is now true
  - next(object_5,object_9) is removed

Step 3 — t = 2
Action: tightfisted object_10 object_5 object_8
- Action signature: tightfisted(subject, x, y)
- Preconditions required:
  - hand(object_10) — true (initial)
  - sneeze(object_5) — true (initial)
  - texture(object_8) — true (initial)
  - next(object_5, object_8) — true (added in Step 2)
  - vase(object_10, object_5) — true (added in Step 1)
- Effects:
  - ADD next(object_10, object_8)
  - DELETE vase(object_10, object_5)
- State change after Step 3:
  - next(object_10,object_8) is now true
  - vase(object_10,object_5) is removed

Step 4 — t = 3
Action: sip object_10 object_0 object_8
- Action signature: sip(subject, x, y)
- Preconditions required:
  - hand(object_10) — true (initial)
  - cats(object_0) — true (initial)
  - texture(object_8) — true (initial)
  - next(object_10, object_8) — true (added in Step 3)
  - next(object_0, object_8) — true (initial)
- Effects:
  - ADD vase(object_10, object_0)
  - DELETE next(object_10, object_8)
- State change after Step 4:
  - vase(object_10,object_0) is now true
  - next(object_10,object_8) is removed

Step 5 — t = 4
Action: memory object_0 object_8 object_6
- Action signature: memory(x, y, z)
- Preconditions required:
  - cats(object_0) — true (initial)
  - spring(object_8) — true (initial)
  - spring(object_6) — true (initial)
  - next(object_0, object_8) — true (initial; still present)
- Effects:
  - ADD next(object_0, object_6)
  - DELETE next(object_0, object_8)
- State change after Step 5:
  - next(object_0,object_6) is now true
  - next(object_0,object_8) is removed

Step 6 — t = 5
Action: paltry object_10 object_0 object_6
- Action signature: paltry(subject, x, y)
- Preconditions required:
  - hand(object_10) — true (initial)
  - cats(object_0) — true (initial)
  - texture(object_6) — true (initial)
  - vase(object_10, object_0) — true (added in Step 4)
  - next(object_0, object_6) — true (added in Step 5)
- Effects:
  - ADD next(object_10, object_6)
  - DELETE vase(object_10, object_0)
- State change after Step 6:
  - next(object_10,object_6) is now true (goal achieved)
  - vase(object_10,object_0) is removed

Final state and goal check
- The goal (next object_10 object_6) is true after Step 6.
- All actions in the provided plan have preconditions satisfied at their time of execution (using initial facts plus effects of earlier steps).
- No extra actions were added or removed; the plan execution is consistent with the domain rules and initial facts.

Timing summary
- Actions executed at timestamps t = 0,1,2,3,4,5 respectively.
- Duration per action: 1 time unit (unit cost).
- Total cost / makespan: 6 units.

Notes on ambiguities (brief)
- This execution assumes the STRIPS semantics given in the domain: effects are applied immediately and can enable later actions.
- No naming conflicts were needed to resolve for this single scenario; all referenced predicates and objects are present in the domain and problem.

If you want, I can also present this same sequence in a compact timeline table or annotate the full state (all predicates) after each step.
