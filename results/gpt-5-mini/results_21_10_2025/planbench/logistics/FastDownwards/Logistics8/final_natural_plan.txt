Plan (3 actions, unit cost). Timeline uses integer timestamps (start times) and 1.0 time units per action.

1) Time 0.0 — Action: clip object_9 object_4 object_8
   - Parameters: X=object_9, Y=object_4, Z=object_8
   - Preconditions (checked against initial facts): 
     - (hand object_9) — true
     - (sneeze object_4) — true
     - (texture object_8) — true
     - (next object_4 object_8) — true
     - (next object_9 object_8) — true
     => All preconditions satisfied.
   - Duration: 1.0 time unit (finishes at 1.0)
   - Effects applied:
     - Added: (vase object_9 object_4)
     - Removed: (next object_9 object_8)
   - State changes (delta): next(object_9,object_8) is deleted; vase(object_9,object_4) is created.

2) Time 1.0 — Action: wretched object_4 object_8 object_7 object_2
   - Parameters: X=object_4, Y=object_8, Z=object_7, W=object_2
   - Preconditions (checked after step 1):
     - (sneeze object_4) — true
     - (texture object_8) — true
     - (texture object_7) — true
     - (stupendous object_2) — true
     - (next object_4 object_8) — true (was not removed by step 1)
     - (collect object_8 object_2) — true
     - (collect object_7 object_2) — true
     => All preconditions satisfied.
   - Duration: 1.0 time unit (finishes at 2.0)
   - Effects applied:
     - Added: (next object_4 object_7)
     - Removed: (next object_4 object_8)
   - State changes (delta): next(object_4,object_7) is created; next(object_4,object_8) is deleted.

3) Time 2.0 — Action: tightfisted object_9 object_4 object_7
   - Parameters: X=object_9, Y=object_4, Z=object_7
   - Preconditions (checked after step 2):
     - (hand object_9) — true
     - (sneeze object_4) — true
     - (texture object_7) — true
     - (next object_4 object_7) — true (added by step 2)
     - (vase object_9 object_4) — true (added by step 1)
     => All preconditions satisfied.
   - Duration: 1.0 time unit (finishes at 3.0)
   - Effects applied:
     - Added: (next object_9 object_7)
     - Removed: (vase object_9 object_4)
   - State changes (delta): next(object_9,object_7) is created; vase(object_9,object_4) is deleted.

Final check (after all actions complete):
 - (next object_10 object_5) — remained true throughout (initially true, never deleted)
 - (next object_9 object_7) — created by step 3
 => Both goal predicates are true; the plan achieves the final goal.

Notes / Observations:
 - Every action in the provided plan has its preconditions satisfied in sequence given the scenario-1 initial facts.
 - The plan strictly follows the three given steps and no extra actions were added or removed.
 - Timestamps/durations are provided as simple 1.0-unit steps to show ordering and when each precondition/effect becomes applicable.
