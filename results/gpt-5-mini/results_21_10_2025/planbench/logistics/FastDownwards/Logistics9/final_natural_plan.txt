Plan executed as a human-readable ordered sequence. Assumed uniform action duration = 1 time unit; start time = 0. Each step shows preconditions (as checked at that moment), effects (added/removed facts), and the time interval.

Step 1 — time 0 → 1
Action: clip(object_9, object_3, object_5)
- Preconditions checked and satisfied: hand(object_9), sneeze(object_3), texture(object_5), next(object_3,object_5), next(object_9,object_5)
- Effects: add vase(object_9,object_3); remove next(object_9,object_5)

Step 2 — time 1 → 2
Action: wretched(object_3, object_5, object_6, object_1)
- Preconditions checked and satisfied: sneeze(object_3), texture(object_5), texture(object_6), stupendous(object_1), next(object_3,object_5), collect(object_5,object_1), collect(object_6,object_1)
- Effects: add next(object_3,object_6); remove next(object_3,object_5)

Step 3 — time 2 → 3
Action: tightfisted(object_9, object_3, object_6)
- Preconditions checked and satisfied: hand(object_9), sneeze(object_3), texture(object_6), next(object_3,object_6), vase(object_9,object_3)
- Effects: add next(object_9,object_6); remove vase(object_9,object_3)

Step 4 — time 3 → 4
Action: wretched(object_4, object_8, object_9, object_3)
- Preconditions checked and satisfied: sneeze(object_4), texture(object_8), texture(object_9), stupendous(object_3), next(object_4,object_8), collect(object_8,object_3), collect(object_9,object_3)
- Effects: add next(object_4,object_9); remove next(object_4,object_8)

Step 5 — time 4 → 5
Action: clip(object_11, object_4, object_9)
- Preconditions checked and satisfied: hand(object_11), sneeze(object_4), texture(object_9), next(object_4,object_9), next(object_11,object_9)
- Effects: add vase(object_11,object_4); remove next(object_11,object_9)

Step 6 — time 5 → 6
Action: wretched(object_4, object_6, object_8, object_2)
- Preconditions checked and satisfied: sneeze(object_4), texture(object_6), texture(object_8), stupendous(object_2), next(object_4,object_6), collect(object_6,object_2), collect(object_8,object_2)
- Effects: add next(object_4,object_8); remove next(object_4,object_6)

Step 7 — time 6 → 7
Action: tightfisted(object_11, object_4, object_8)
- Preconditions checked and satisfied: hand(object_11), sneeze(object_4), texture(object_8), next(object_4,object_8), vase(object_11,object_4)
- Effects: add next(object_11,object_8); remove vase(object_11,object_4)

Step 8 — time 7 → 8
Action: wretched(object_3, object_6, object_7, object_2)
- Preconditions checked and satisfied: sneeze(object_3), texture(object_6), texture(object_7), stupendous(object_2), next(object_3,object_6), collect(object_6,object_2), collect(object_7,object_2)
- Effects: add next(object_3,object_7); remove next(object_3,object_6)

Step 9 — time 8 → 9
Action: memory(object_1, object_6, object_7)
- Preconditions checked and satisfied: cats(object_1), spring(object_6), spring(object_7), next(object_1,object_6)
- Effects: add next(object_1,object_7); remove next(object_1,object_6)

Step 10 — time 9 → 10
Action: sip(object_10, object_0, object_5)
- Preconditions checked and satisfied: hand(object_10), cats(object_0), texture(object_5), next(object_10,object_5), next(object_0,object_5)
- Effects: add vase(object_10,object_0); remove next(object_10,object_5)

Step 11 — time 10 → 11
Action: memory(object_0, object_8, object_7)
- Preconditions checked and satisfied: cats(object_0), spring(object_8), spring(object_7), next(object_0,object_8)
- Effects: add next(object_0,object_7); remove next(object_0,object_8)

Step 12 — time 11 → 12
Action: paltry(object_10, object_0, object_7)
- Preconditions checked and satisfied: hand(object_10), cats(object_0), texture(object_7), vase(object_10,object_0), next(object_0,object_7)
- Effects: add next(object_10,object_7); remove vase(object_10,object_0)

Final verification (after time 12):
- next(object_10,object_6): present (was in the initial state and never removed) — satisfied.
- next(object_9,object_6): added at Step 3 — satisfied.
- next(object_10,object_7): added at Step 12 — satisfied.
- next(object_11,object_8): added at Step 7 — satisfied.

All four target next relations are achieved. Total plan cost (steps) = 12, total duration = 12 time units.
