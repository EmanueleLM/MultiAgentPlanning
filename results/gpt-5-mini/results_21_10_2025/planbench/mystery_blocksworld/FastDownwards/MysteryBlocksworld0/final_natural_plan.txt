Plan (3 steps, unit duration each; total cost = 3)

Initial state highlights (before step 0):
- hand: object_8
- cats: object_0, object_1
- texture: object_6, object_7
- spring: object_6, object_7
- next: (object_0 object_7), (object_1 object_7), (object_4 object_6), (object_5 object_7), (object_8 object_7)
- collect: (object_6 object_2), (object_7 object_3)
- sneeze: object_4, object_5
- stupendous: object_2, object_3
- No vase facts initially.

Step 1 — time 0 to 1
Action: sip object_8 object_1 object_7
- Parameters: o0=object_8, o1=object_1, o2=object_7
- Preconditions checked and satisfied:
  - (hand object_8) — true
  - (cats object_1) — true
  - (texture object_7) — true
  - (next object_8 object_7) — true
  - (next object_1 object_7) — true
- Effects applied:
  - Add (vase object_8 object_1)
  - Delete (next object_8 object_7)
- State change summary after step 1:
  - (vase object_8 object_1) becomes true
  - (next object_8 object_7) is removed

Step 2 — time 1 to 2
Action: memory object_1 object_7 object_6
- Parameters: o0=object_1, o1=object_7, o2=object_6
- Preconditions checked and satisfied:
  - (cats object_1) — true
  - (spring object_7) — true
  - (spring object_6) — true
  - (next object_1 object_7) — true (still true after Step 1)
- Effects applied:
  - Add (next object_1 object_6)
  - Delete (next object_1 object_7)
- State change summary after step 2:
  - (next object_1 object_6) becomes true
  - (next object_1 object_7) is removed

Step 3 — time 2 to 3
Action: paltry object_8 object_1 object_6
- Parameters: o0=object_8, o1=object_1, o2=object_6
- Preconditions checked and satisfied:
  - (hand object_8) — true
  - (cats object_1) — true
  - (texture object_6) — true
  - (vase object_8 object_1) — true (added in Step 1)
  - (next object_1 object_6) — true (added in Step 2)
- Effects applied:
  - Add (next object_8 object_6)
  - Delete (vase object_8 object_1)
- State change summary after step 3:
  - (next object_8 object_6) becomes true (goal achieved)
  - (vase object_8 object_1) is removed

Goal check (after time 3)
- Goal (next object_8 object_6) is true. Goal achieved at time 3.

Total plan cost: 3 (three unit-duration actions).
