Summary: execute the two planned actions in order. Each step shows a timestamp (start → end), required preconditions and whether they are present, the effects applied, and the resulting key facts. Total plan cost: 2 (unit cost).

Step 1 — Action: sip object_8 object_0 object_7
- Time: 00:00:00 → 00:00:01 (duration 1)
- Action signature: sip ?o0 ?o1 ?o2  => sip object_8 object_0 object_7
- Preconditions (required):
  - hand object_8 — PRESENT (initial facts)
  - cats object_0 — PRESENT (initial facts)
  - texture object_7 — PRESENT (initial facts)
  - next object_8 object_7 — PRESENT (initial facts)
  - next object_0 object_7 — PRESENT (initial facts)
  => All preconditions satisfied.
- Effects applied:
  - Add: vase object_8 object_0
  - Remove: next object_8 object_7
- State changes (key facts after step):
  - next object_8 object_7 is removed.
  - vase object_8 object_0 is now true.
  - Other facts remain unchanged unless listed above.

Step 2 — Action: paltry object_8 object_0 object_6
- Time: 00:00:01 → 00:00:02 (duration 1)
- Action signature: paltry ?o0 ?o1 ?o2  => paltry object_8 object_0 object_6
- Preconditions (required):
  - hand object_8 — PRESENT (initial facts)
  - cats object_0 — PRESENT (initial facts)
  - texture object_6 — PRESENT (initial facts)
  - vase object_8 object_0 — PRESENT (added by Step 1)
  - next object_0 object_6 — PRESENT (initial facts)
  => All preconditions satisfied.
- Effects applied:
  - Add: next object_8 object_6
  - Remove: vase object_8 object_0
- State changes (key facts after step):
  - next object_8 object_6 is now true.
  - vase object_8 object_0 is removed.
  - next object_7 object_6 was already true in the initial state and remains true.

Final state check (after both steps, time 00:00:02):
- Required goal predicates:
  - next object_7 object_6 — PRESENT (from initial state)
  - next object_8 object_6 — PRESENT (added in Step 2)
=> Goal satisfied.

Plan cost: 2 (two actions, unit cost each).
