Final state summary (relevant predicates after all steps):
- next object_0 object_6 (unchanged)
- next object_1 object_6 (restored by step 17)
- next object_4 object_7 (restored by step 20)
- next object_5 object_9 (set by step 12)
- next object_10 object_6 (added step 22)    ← goal element
- next object_11 object_9 (added step 14)    ← goal element
- next object_12 object_7 (added step 21)    ← goal element
- next object_13 object_9 (added step 13)    ← goal element

Vase relations remaining at end:
- (none required for the goal; last remaining vases were removed as plan progressed; final vase object_10 object_1 was deleted at step 22)

Goal check:
Requested goal: next object_10 object_6, next object_11 object_9, next object_12 object_7, next object_13 object_9.
Result: ALL PRESENT in final state — GOAL ACHIEVED.

Precondition failures or ambiguities: None. Every step's preconditions were satisfied at the time the action was applied given the initial facts and the intermediate state updates produced by prior actions.

Notes on timing: timestamps are illustrative (10-second spacing) and show the ordered application of actions; the plan is sequential and each step depends on prior state updates as documented above.
