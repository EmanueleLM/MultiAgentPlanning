Below is a clear, step-by-step, human-readable trace of the given plan. Each step matches the plan exactly, shows a simple timestamp (relative, starting at t=0) and duration (1 time unit each), lists the action's required preconditions and whether they are satisfied at that moment, and states the add/delete effects produced. At the end I confirm that the final goal is achieved.

Initial relevant facts (before step 1)
- cats object_0
- collect object_5 object_1
- collect object_6 object_2
- hand object_7
- hand object_8
- next object_0 object_6
- next object_3 object_5
- next object_4 object_6
- next object_7 object_6
- next object_8 object_6
- sneeze object_3
- sneeze object_4
- spring object_5
- spring object_6
- stupendous object_1
- stupendous object_2
- texture object_5
- texture object_6
(There are no vase(...) facts initially.)

Step 1 — t=0.0 to t=1.0
Action: sip object_8 object_0 object_6
- Parameters mapping: ?o0 = object_8, ?o1 = object_0, ?o2 = object_6
- Preconditions (required):
  - hand object_8 — satisfied (initial)
  - cats object_0 — satisfied (initial)
  - texture object_6 — satisfied (initial)
  - next object_8 object_6 — satisfied (initial)
  - next object_0 object_6 — satisfied (initial)
- Effects:
  - Add: vase object_8 object_0 (becomes true)
  - Delete: next object_8 object_6 (becomes false)
- Resulting relevant facts after step: vase object_8 object_0 is true; next object_8 object_6 removed. next object_0 object_6 remains true.

Step 2 — t=1.0 to t=2.0
Action: sip object_7 object_0 object_6
- Parameters: ?o0 = object_7, ?o1 = object_0, ?o2 = object_6
- Preconditions:
  - hand object_7 — satisfied (initial)
  - cats object_0 — satisfied (initial)
  - texture object_6 — satisfied (initial)
  - next object_7 object_6 — satisfied (initial)
  - next object_0 object_6 — still satisfied (was not deleted by step 1)
- Effects:
  - Add: vase object_7 object_0 (becomes true)
  - Delete: next object_7 object_6 (becomes false)
- Resulting relevant facts after step: vase object_7 object_0 is true; next object_7 object_6 removed. next object_0 object_6 remains true.

Step 3 — t=2.0 to t=3.0
Action: memory object_0 object_6 object_5
- Parameters: ?o0 = object_0, ?o1 = object_6, ?o2 = object_5
- Preconditions:
  - cats object_0 — satisfied (initial)
  - spring object_6 — satisfied (initial)
  - spring object_5 — satisfied (initial)
  - next object_0 object_6 — satisfied (carried over until now)
- Effects:
  - Add: next object_0 object_5 (becomes true)
  - Delete: next object_0 object_6 (becomes false)
- Resulting relevant facts after step: next object_0 object_5 is true; next object_0 object_6 removed.

Step 4 — t=3.0 to t=4.0
Action: paltry object_8 object_0 object_5
- Parameters: ?o0 = object_8, ?o1 = object_0, ?o2 = object_5
- Preconditions:
  - hand object_8 — satisfied (initial)
  - cats object_0 — satisfied (initial)
  - texture object_5 — satisfied (initial)
  - vase object_8 object_0 — satisfied (added by Step 1)
  - next object_0 object_5 — satisfied (added by Step 3)
- Effects:
  - Add: next object_8 object_5 (becomes true)
  - Delete: vase object_8 object_0 (becomes false)
- Resulting relevant facts after step: next object_8 object_5 is true; vase object_8 object_0 removed. (vase object_7 object_0 still true from Step 2)

Step 5 — t=4.0 to t=5.0
Action: paltry object_7 object_0 object_5
- Parameters: ?o0 = object_7, ?o1 = object_0, ?o2 = object_5
- Preconditions:
  - hand object_7 — satisfied (initial)
  - cats object_0 — satisfied (initial)
  - texture object_5 — satisfied (initial)
  - vase object_7 object_0 — satisfied (added by Step 2)
  - next object_0 object_5 — satisfied (added by Step 3)
- Effects:
  - Add: next object_7 object_5 (becomes true)
  - Delete: vase object_7 object_0 (becomes false)
- Resulting relevant facts after step: next object_7 object_5 is true; vase object_7 object_0 removed.

Final relevant facts (after step 5)
- next object_7 object_5 — true (added Step 5)
- next object_8 object_5 — true (added Step 4)
- The plan did not reintroduce next object_0 object_6, next object_7 object_6, or next object_8 object_6 (those were deleted during the run).

Goal check
- Goal: (next object_7 object_5) AND (next object_8 object_5)
- Both are true in the final state. The plan achieves the goal.

Summary
- The sequence of five actions (sip, sip, memory, paltry, paltry) is valid given the initial facts and the action schemata. Each action's preconditions were met when executed, and the actions produced the specified add/delete effects. The final goal (next object_7 object_5 and next object_8 object_5) is achieved at t=5.0.
