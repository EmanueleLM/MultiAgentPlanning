Plan (7 steps, each step duration ≈ 1s; total cost = 7)

Step 1 — t = 0s → 1s
Action: observer_a_clip(object_12, object_4, object_10)
- Preconditions (satisfied): hand(object_12), sneeze(object_4), texture(object_10), next(object_4, object_10), next(object_12, object_10)
- Effects: add vase(object_12, object_4); remove next(object_12, object_10)

Step 2 — t = 1s → 2s
Action: observer_a_wretched(object_4, object_10, object_8, object_2)
- Preconditions (satisfied): sneeze(object_4), texture(object_10), texture(object_8), stupendous(object_2), next(object_4, object_10), collect(object_10, object_2), collect(object_8, object_2)
- Effects: add next(object_4, object_8); remove next(object_4, object_10)

Step 3 — t = 2s → 3s
Action: observer_a_tightfisted(object_12, object_4, object_8)
- Preconditions (satisfied): hand(object_12), sneeze(object_4), texture(object_8), next(object_4, object_8), vase(object_12, object_4)
- Effects: add next(object_12, object_8); remove vase(object_12, object_4)
- Note: This produces next(object_12, object_8) — one half of the final goal.

Step 4 — t = 3s → 4s
Action: observer_a_wretched(object_3, object_7, object_6, object_1)
- Preconditions (satisfied): sneeze(object_3), texture(object_7), texture(object_6), stupendous(object_1), next(object_3, object_7), collect(object_7, object_1), collect(object_6, object_1)
- Effects: add next(object_3, object_6); remove next(object_3, object_7)

Step 5 — t = 4s → 5s
Action: observer_a_clip(object_11, object_3, object_6)
- Preconditions (satisfied): hand(object_11), sneeze(object_3), texture(object_6), next(object_3, object_6), next(object_11, object_6)
- Effects: add vase(object_11, object_3); remove next(object_11, object_6)

Step 6 — t = 5s → 6s
Action: observer_a_wretched(object_3, object_6, object_7, object_1)
- Preconditions (satisfied): sneeze(object_3), texture(object_6), texture(object_7), stupendous(object_1), next(object_3, object_6), collect(object_6, object_1), collect(object_7, object_1)
- Effects: add next(object_3, object_7); remove next(object_3, object_6)

Step 7 — t = 6s → 7s
Action: observer_a_tightfisted(object_11, object_3, object_7)
- Preconditions (satisfied): hand(object_11), sneeze(object_3), texture(object_7), next(object_3, object_7), vase(object_11, object_3)
- Effects: add next(object_11, object_7); remove vase(object_11, object_3)
- Note: This produces next(object_11, object_7) — the other half of the final goal.

Result after step 7
- Achieved goals: next(object_11, object_7) and next(object_12, object_8)
- Total steps: 7, total estimated time ≈ 7s, total cost = 7

All steps match the provided plan exactly; each action’s preconditions were satisfied at the time it was applied and the stated effects produce the required final predicates.
