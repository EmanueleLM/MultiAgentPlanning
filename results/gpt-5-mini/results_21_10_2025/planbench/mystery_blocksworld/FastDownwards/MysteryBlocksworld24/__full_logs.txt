PROBLEM
------------------------------
I am playing with a set of objects. Here are the actions I can do

Paltry object_0 object_1 object_2.

Clip object_0 object_1 object_2.
Wretched object_0 object_1 object_2 object_3.
Memory object_0 object_1 object_2.
Tightfisted object_0 object_1 object_2.

I have the following restrictions on my actions:
To perform paltry action, the following facts need to be true: hand object_0, cats object_1, texture object_2, vase object_0 object_1, and next object_1 object_2
Once paltry is performed the following facts will be true: next object_0 object_2
Once paltry is performed the following facts will be false: vase object_0 object_1
To perform sip action, the following facts need to be true: hand object_0, cats object_1, texture object_2, next object_0 object_2, and next object_1 object_2
Once sip is performed the following facts will be true: vase object_0 object_1
Once sip is performed the following facts will be false: next object_0 object_2

NATURAL-PLAN sas_plan_1
------------------------------
Plan (3 steps, unit duration each; total cost = 3)

Initial state highlights (before step 0):
- hand: object_8
- cats: object_0, object_1
- texture: object_6, object_7
- spring: object_6, object_7
- next: (object_0 object_7), (object_1 object_7), (object_4 object_6), (object_5 object_7), (object_8 object_7)
- collect: (object_6 object_2), (object_7 object_3)
- sneeze: object_4, object_5
- stupendous: object_2, object_3
- No vase facts initially.

Step 1 — time 0 to 1
Action: sip object_8 object_1 object_7
- Parameters: o0=object_8, o1=object_1, o2=object_7
- Preconditions checked and satisfied:
  - (hand object_8) — true
  - (cats object_1) — true
  - (texture object_7) — true
  - (next object_8 object_7) — true
  - (next object_1 object_7) — true
- Effects applied:
  - Add (vase object_8 object_1)
  - Delete (next object_8 object_7)
- State change summary after step 1:
  - (vase object_8 object_1) becomes true
  - (next object_8 object_7) is removed

Step 2 — time 1 to 2
Action: memory object_1 object_7 object_6
- Parameters: o0=object_1, o1=object_7, o2=object_6
- Preconditions checked and satisfied:
  - (cats object_1) — true
  - (spring object_7) — true
  - (spring object_6) — true
  - (next object_1 object_7) — true (still true after Step 1)
- Effects applied:
  - Add (next object_1 object_6)
  - Delete (next object_1 object_7)
- State change summary after step 2:
  - (next object_1 object_6) becomes true
  - (next object_1 object_7) is removed

Step 3 — time 2 to 3
Action: paltry object_8 object_1 object_6
- Parameters: o0=object_8, o1=object_1, o2=object_6
- Preconditions checked and satisfied:
  - (hand object_8) — true
  - (cats object_1) — true
  - (texture object_6) — true
  - (vase object_8 object_1) — true (added in Step 1)
  - (next object_1 object_6) — true (added in Step 2)
- Effects applied:
  - Add (next object_8 object_6)
  - Delete (vase object_8 object_1)
- State change summary after step 3:
  - (next object_8 object_6) becomes true (goal achieved)
  - (vase object_8 object_1) is removed

Goal check (after time 3)
- Goal (next object_8 object_6) is true. Goal achieved at time 3.

Total plan cost: 3 (three unit-duration actions).

NATURAL-PLAN sas_plan_1
------------------------------
Summary: execute the two planned actions in order. Each step shows a timestamp (start → end), required preconditions and whether they are present, the effects applied, and the resulting key facts. Total plan cost: 2 (unit cost).

Step 1 — Action: sip object_8 object_0 object_7
- Time: 00:00:00 → 00:00:01 (duration 1)
- Action signature: sip ?o0 ?o1 ?o2  => sip object_8 object_0 object_7
- Preconditions (required):
  - hand object_8 — PRESENT (initial facts)
  - cats object_0 — PRESENT (initial facts)
  - texture object_7 — PRESENT (initial facts)
  - next object_8 object_7 — PRESENT (initial facts)
  - next object_0 object_7 — PRESENT (initial facts)
  => All preconditions satisfied.
- Effects applied:
  - Add: vase object_8 object_0
  - Remove: next object_8 object_7
- State changes (key facts after step):
  - next object_8 object_7 is removed.
  - vase object_8 object_0 is now true.
  - Other facts remain unchanged unless listed above.

Step 2 — Action: paltry object_8 object_0 object_6
- Time: 00:00:01 → 00:00:02 (duration 1)
- Action signature: paltry ?o0 ?o1 ?o2  => paltry object_8 object_0 object_6
- Preconditions (required):
  - hand object_8 — PRESENT (initial facts)
  - cats object_0 — PRESENT (initial facts)
  - texture object_6 — PRESENT (initial facts)
  - vase object_8 object_0 — PRESENT (added by Step 1)
  - next object_0 object_6 — PRESENT (initial facts)
  => All preconditions satisfied.
- Effects applied:
  - Add: next object_8 object_6
  - Remove: vase object_8 object_0
- State changes (key facts after step):
  - next object_8 object_6 is now true.
  - vase object_8 object_0 is removed.
  - next object_7 object_6 was already true in the initial state and remains true.

Final state check (after both steps, time 00:00:02):
- Required goal predicates:
  - next object_7 object_6 — PRESENT (from initial state)
  - next object_8 object_6 — PRESENT (added in Step 2)
=> Goal satisfied.

Plan cost: 2 (two actions, unit cost each).

NATURAL-PLAN sas_plan_1
------------------------------
Below is a clear, step-by-step, human-readable trace of the given plan. Each step matches the plan exactly, shows a simple timestamp (relative, starting at t=0) and duration (1 time unit each), lists the action's required preconditions and whether they are satisfied at that moment, and states the add/delete effects produced. At the end I confirm that the final goal is achieved.

Initial relevant facts (before step 1)
- cats object_0
- collect object_5 object_1
- collect object_6 object_2
- hand object_7
- hand object_8
- next object_0 object_6
- next object_3 object_5
- next object_4 object_6
- next object_7 object_6
- next object_8 object_6
- sneeze object_3
- sneeze object_4
- spring object_5
- spring object_6
- stupendous object_1
- stupendous object_2
- texture object_5
- texture object_6
(There are no vase(...) facts initially.)

Step 1 — t=0.0 to t=1.0
Action: sip object_8 object_0 object_6
- Parameters mapping: ?o0 = object_8, ?o1 = object_0, ?o2 = object_6
- Preconditions (required):
  - hand object_8 — satisfied (initial)
  - cats object_0 — satisfied (initial)
  - texture object_6 — satisfied (initial)
  - next object_8 object_6 — satisfied (initial)
  - next object_0 object_6 — satisfied (initial)
- Effects:
  - Add: vase object_8 object_0 (becomes true)
  - Delete: next object_8 object_6 (becomes false)
- Resulting relevant facts after step: vase object_8 object_0 is true; next object_8 object_6 removed. next object_0 object_6 remains true.

Step 2 — t=1.0 to t=2.0
Action: sip object_7 object_0 object_6
- Parameters: ?o0 = object_7, ?o1 = object_0, ?o2 = object_6
- Preconditions:
  - hand object_7 — satisfied (initial)
  - cats object_0 — satisfied (initial)
  - texture object_6 — satisfied (initial)
  - next object_7 object_6 — satisfied (initial)
  - next object_0 object_6 — still satisfied (was not deleted by step 1)
- Effects:
  - Add: vase object_7 object_0 (becomes true)
  - Delete: next object_7 object_6 (becomes false)
- Resulting relevant facts after step: vase object_7 object_0 is true; next object_7 object_6 removed. next object_0 object_6 remains true.

Step 3 — t=2.0 to t=3.0
Action: memory object_0 object_6 object_5
- Parameters: ?o0 = object_0, ?o1 = object_6, ?o2 = object_5
- Preconditions:
  - cats object_0 — satisfied (initial)
  - spring object_6 — satisfied (initial)
  - spring object_5 — satisfied (initial)
  - next object_0 object_6 — satisfied (carried over until now)
- Effects:
  - Add: next object_0 object_5 (becomes true)
  - Delete: next object_0 object_6 (becomes false)
- Resulting relevant facts after step: next object_0 object_5 is true; next object_0 object_6 removed.

Step 4 — t=3.0 to t=4.0
Action: paltry object_8 object_0 object_5
- Parameters: ?o0 = object_8, ?o1 = object_0, ?o2 = object_5
- Preconditions:
  - hand object_8 — satisfied (initial)
  - cats object_0 — satisfied (initial)
  - texture object_5 — satisfied (initial)
  - vase object_8 object_0 — satisfied (added by Step 1)
  - next object_0 object_5 — satisfied (added by Step 3)
- Effects:
  - Add: next object_8 object_5 (becomes true)
  - Delete: vase object_8 object_0 (becomes false)
- Resulting relevant facts after step: next object_8 object_5 is true; vase object_8 object_0 removed. (vase object_7 object_0 still true from Step 2)

Step 5 — t=4.0 to t=5.0
Action: paltry object_7 object_0 object_5
- Parameters: ?o0 = object_7, ?o1 = object_0, ?o2 = object_5
- Preconditions:
  - hand object_7 — satisfied (initial)
  - cats object_0 — satisfied (initial)
  - texture object_5 — satisfied (initial)
  - vase object_7 object_0 — satisfied (added by Step 2)
  - next object_0 object_5 — satisfied (added by Step 3)
- Effects:
  - Add: next object_7 object_5 (becomes true)
  - Delete: vase object_7 object_0 (becomes false)
- Resulting relevant facts after step: next object_7 object_5 is true; vase object_7 object_0 removed.

Final relevant facts (after step 5)
- next object_7 object_5 — true (added Step 5)
- next object_8 object_5 — true (added Step 4)
- The plan did not reintroduce next object_0 object_6, next object_7 object_6, or next object_8 object_6 (those were deleted during the run).

Goal check
- Goal: (next object_7 object_5) AND (next object_8 object_5)
- Both are true in the final state. The plan achieves the goal.

Summary
- The sequence of five actions (sip, sip, memory, paltry, paltry) is valid given the initial facts and the action schemata. Each action's preconditions were met when executed, and the actions produced the specified add/delete effects. The final goal (next object_7 object_5 and next object_8 object_5) is achieved at t=5.0.

FINAL-PLAN
------------------------------
I don't have the public action model or the analysis results from analyst_A and analyst_B in this conversation, so I cannot generate a correct, complete PDDL domain and problem(s) yet. Please provide those inputs. To make that easy, below I list exactly what I need and give a short checklist and formatting guidance so the PDDL I generate will be compatible with Fast Downwards and your constraints.

What I need from you (copy/paste the analysts' outputs and the public action model):
1. Public action model (natural-language description of each available action):
   - Action name, actors/agent who can execute it (distinct agents if multiple), preconditions (facts that must hold), and effects (facts added and facts deleted).
   - If any action has conditional effects or ADL-like semantics, state them explicitly.
   - If any actions are unavailable to some agents or depend on resources, state that.

2. Analyst_A report:
   - List of inferred or observed facts about the initial environment (objects, agents, locations, resource quantities).
   - Any constraints or preferences that must be treated as strict (the prompt instructs to treat "would rather/avoid/earliest" as hard constraints).
   - Any ambiguous elements Analyst_A flagged and any suggested resolutions.

3. Analyst_B report:
   - Same format: initial facts, constraints, ambiguities flagged, and suggested resolutions.

4. Scenario(s) to encode as problem(s):
   - Concrete list of objects (with types if relevant), which agents exist, and the initial truth values (predicates that are true initially).
   - The goal condition(s) to achieve (exact logical formula expected).
   - If there are multiple scenarios, give each scenario separately.

5. Any additional constraints:
   - Are there typed object classes you want used? (e.g., agent, location, package, resource)
   - Are there resources with numeric quantities? Note: Fast Downwards STRIPS doesn't support numeric fluents unless we use specialized extensions; per developer instructions, limit to :strips, :typing, :negative-preconditions (and optionally :action-costs). If resources must be numeric, state whether they can be modeled as discrete counted objects instead.

Formatting guidance (so I can convert directly to PDDL):
- For each action, provide something like:
  Action: move
  Agent: courier
  Parameters: (?a - courier ?from - loc ?to - loc)
  Preconditions: (at ?a ?from)
  Effects: (not (at ?a ?from)) (at ?a ?to)
- For initial facts, provide predicate names and ground atoms, e.g.:
  (at courier1 locA)
  (package pkg1)
  (at pkg1 locA)

Important constraints I'll follow when generating PDDL:
- I will only use :requirements { :strips :typing :negative-preconditions } (and :action-costs only if you explicitly require/action-costs data).
- I will preserve agent actions as distinct actions (no merging) and maintain the intended semantics.
- Natural-language preferences will be encoded as hard constraints (either by forbidden states or required ordering encoded into preconditions), per your instruction.
- I will document any assumptions I must make to resolve ambiguity. I will not invent new actions or availability beyond what you provide.
- I will produce one <domain></domain> block and one or more <problem></problem> blocks matching each scenario you provide.
- I will not include placeholders such as '...' or 'None'.

If you want, you may also supply the preferred typing hierarchy (e.g., agent, loc, item) or I can infer reasonable types from the inputs.

Example of minimal submission you could give (small sample):
- Public action model:
  - move: agent can move between locations if connected. Params (?ag - agent ?from - loc ?to - loc). Pre: (at ?ag ?from) (connected ?from ?to). Eff: (not (at ?ag ?from)) (at ?ag ?to).
  - pickup: courier picks up item at same location. Params (?c - courier ?p - package ?l - loc). Pre: (at ?c ?l) (at ?p ?l) (freehand ?c). Eff: (holding ?c ?p) (not (at ?p ?l)) (not (freehand ?c)).
  - deliver: courier delivers package at a location. Params (?c - courier ?p - package ?l - loc). Pre: (holding ?c ?p) (at ?c ?l) (destination ?p ?l). Eff: (delivered ?p) (not (holding ?c ?p)) (freehand ?c).

- Analyst_A initial facts:
  (connected locA locB)
  (connected locB locC)
  (at courier1 locA)
  (at pkg1 locA)
  (destination pkg1 locC)
  (freehand courier1)

- Analyst_B constraints:
  - courier1 must not pass through locB (preference -> treat as constraint: disallow move to locB for courier1).

- Scenario name: deliver-pkg1

When you provide the actual analysts' reports and public action model, I will:
- Resolve any reported ambiguities (documenting my assumptions).
- Produce a complete PDDL domain and one or more PDDL problems enclosed in <domain>...</domain> and <problem>...</problem> tags compatible with Fast Downwards.

Please paste the analysts' outputs and the public action model now.

It makes next(o1,o7) true and deletes next(o1,o6).\n    - Step 2 (sip o9 o1 o7) requires hand(o9), cats(o1), texture(o7), next(o9,o7) and next(o1,o7). next(o9,o7) is in the initial state and next(o1,o7) was added by step 1. It adds vase(o9,o1) and deletes next(o9,o7).\n    - Step 3 (memory o1 o7 o6) is applicable because cats(o1), spring(o7), spring(o6) and next(o1,o7) (present after step 1 and not deleted by step 2). It re-establishes next(o1,o6) and deletes next(o1,o7).\n    - Step 4 (paltry o9 o1 o6) is applicable because hand(o9), cats(o1), texture(o6), vase(o9,o1) (added by step 2 and not yet deleted), and next(o1,o6) (re-added by step 3) are true. It adds next(o9,o6). The plan leaves next(o8,o7) untouched (it is true initially).\n    - Final state contains next(o8,o7) (initial) and next(o9,o6) (added by step 4): goal satisfied.\n\nScenario 2 (concrete determination):\n  With the provided Scenario 2 initial facts and without adding any facts, the goal next object_9 object_8 is not reachable.\n  Reason: No action that produces next(o9,o8) has its preconditions fully satisfied by the given initial facts:\n    - memory requires cats(o9) and next(o9, something) \u2014 cats(o9) is absent.\n    - paltry / tightfisted require an existing next(x,o8) and vase(o9,x) \u2014 there is no next(*,o8) initially, and no vase facts.\n    - wretched could produce next(x,o8) for some x but requires collect facts pairing the involved objects with a stupendous object; the required collect pairs are missing for any candidate combination.\n  Conclusion: Scenario 2 is unsolvable under the given initial facts. To make it solvable one must add appropriate facts (examples: a next(*,object_8) fact and/or appropriate collect or vase facts or cats(object_9), depending on chosen plan). Any such assumption must be declared explicitly before generating a different problem instance."

NATURAL-PLAN sas_plan_1
------------------------------
Summary: execute the given 4-step plan exactly as provided. Each step lists a timestamp/duration (illustrative), the action taken, the preconditions and whether they are satisfied at that moment, the action effects, and the resulting key state changes. At the end I verify the goal (next object_8 object_7 AND next object_9 object_6) is satisfied.

Initial relevant facts (from the problem):
- cats: object_0, object_1
- hand: object_8, object_9
- spring: object_6, object_7
- texture: object_6, object_7
- next: object_0→object_6, object_1→object_6, object_4→object_6, object_5→object_7, object_8→object_7, object_9→object_7
- collect: object_6→object_2, object_7→object_3
- sneeze: object_4, object_5
- stupendous: object_2, object_3
- (No vase facts initially.)

Step 1 — t = 0 s, duration ≈ 1 s
Action: memory(object_1, object_6, object_7)

- Preconditions required by memory(x,y,z): (cats x), (spring y), (spring z), (next x y)
  - cats object_1 — TRUE (initial)
  - spring object_6 — TRUE (initial)
  - spring object_7 — TRUE (initial)
  - next object_1 object_6 — TRUE (initial)
- All preconditions satisfied → action is applicable.

- Effects of memory: add (next object_1 object_7); delete (next object_1 object_6).
- State changes produced:
  - next object_1 object_7 becomes TRUE.
  - next object_1 object_6 becomes FALSE.
- Key next facts after step 1 (relevant subset):
  - next object_1→object_7 (new)
  - next object_9→object_7 (unchanged)
  - next object_8→object_7 (unchanged)

Step 2 — t = 1 s, duration ≈ 1 s
Action: sip(object_9, object_1, object_7)

- Preconditions required by sip(x,y,z): (hand x), (cats y), (texture z), (next x z), (next y z)
  - hand object_9 — TRUE (initial)
  - cats object_1 — TRUE (initial)
  - texture object_7 — TRUE (initial)
  - next object_9 object_7 — TRUE (initial)
  - next object_1 object_7 — TRUE (established by Step 1)
- All preconditions satisfied → action is applicable.

- Effects of sip: add (vase object_9 object_1); delete (next object_9 object_7).
- State changes produced:
  - vase object_9 object_1 becomes TRUE.
  - next object_9 object_7 becomes FALSE (removed).
- Key next facts after step 2:
  - next object_1→object_7 (still TRUE)
  - next object_9→object_7 (now FALSE)
  - next object_8→object_7 (still TRUE)

Step 3 — t = 2 s, duration ≈ 1 s
Action: memory(object_1, object_7, object_6)

- Preconditions required by memory(x,y,z): (cats x), (spring y), (spring z), (next x y)
  - cats object_1 — TRUE
  - spring object_7 — TRUE
  - spring object_6 — TRUE
  - next object_1 object_7 — TRUE (from Step 1, unchanged by Step 2)
- All preconditions satisfied → action is applicable.

- Effects of memory: add (next object_1 object_6); delete (next object_1 object_7).
- State changes produced:
  - next object_1 object_6 becomes TRUE (restored).
  - next object_1 object_7 becomes FALSE (removed).
- Key next facts after step 3:
  - next object_1→object_6 (TRUE)
  - next object_9→object_7 (FALSE)
  - next object_8→object_7 (TRUE)

Step 4 — t = 3 s, duration ≈ 1 s
Action: paltry(object_9, object_1, object_6)

- Preconditions required by paltry(x,y,z): (hand x), (cats y), (texture z), (vase x y), (next y z)
  - hand object_9 — TRUE
  - cats object_1 — TRUE
  - texture object_6 — TRUE
  - vase object_9 object_1 — TRUE (created in Step 2)
  - next object_1 object_6 — TRUE (created in Step 3)
- All preconditions satisfied → action is applicable.

- Effects of paltry: add (next object_9 object_6); delete (vase object_9 object_1).
- State changes produced:
  - next object_9 object_6 becomes TRUE.
  - vase object_9 object_1 becomes FALSE (removed).

Final relevant facts after Step 4:
- next object_8 object_7 — TRUE (never removed; was true initially)
- next object_9 object_6 — TRUE (created in Step 4)
- Other next facts: next object_1 object_6 — TRUE (from Step 3); next object_1 object_7 — FALSE; next object_9 object_7 — FALSE.

Goal verification:
- Goal requires: (next object_8 object_7) AND (next object_9 object_6).
  - next object_8 object_7 — TRUE (initial and remained unchanged)
  - next object_9 object_6 — TRUE (established in Step 4)
- Both required facts are TRUE → the goal is satisfied.

Notes and assumptions:
- Timestamps/durations above are illustrative and only to satisfy the request to report time; they do not affect logical applicability.
- No missing facts or ambiguities prevented applying each action in turn; every action's preconditions were present when the action was executed.
- The action sequence is exactly the provided plan and is valid under the domain semantics; it reaches the stated goal.

NATURAL-PLAN sas_plan_2
------------------------------
Step 1 — time 0.0 to 1.0 (duration 1.0)
Action: clip object_9 object_4 object_7

Preconditions checked (all true in the initial state):
- hand object_9
- sneeze object_4
- texture object_7
- next object_4 object_7
- next object_9 object_7

Effects applied:
- Added: vase object_9 object_4
- Removed: next object_9 object_7

State after Step 1 (relevant facts):
- vase(object_9,object_4) is true
- next(object_9,object_7) is false (removed)
- next(object_4,object_7) remains true

Step 2 — time 1.0 to 2.0 (duration 1.0)
Action: wretched object_4 object_7 object_8 object_2

Preconditions checked (all true at time 1.0):
- sneeze object_4
- texture object_7
- texture object_8
- stupendous object_2
- next object_4 object_7
- collect object_7 object_2
- collect object_8 object_2

Effects applied:
- Added: next object_4 object_8
- Removed: next object_4 object_7

State after Step 2 (relevant facts):
- next(object_4,object_8) is true
- next(object_4,object_7) is false (removed)
- vase(object_9,object_4) remains true (from Step 1)

Step 3 — time 2.0 to 3.0 (duration 1.0)
Action: tightfisted object_9 object_4 object_8

Preconditions checked (all true at time 2.0):
- hand object_9
- sneeze object_4
- texture object_8
- next object_4 object_8
- vase object_9 object_4

Effects applied:
- Added: next object_9 object_8
- Removed: vase object_9 object_4

Final state (relevant facts):
- next(object_9,object_8) is true — the problem goal is achieved.
- vase(object_9,object_4) is now false (removed)

Plan summary:
- Actions executed in order: 
  1) clip object_9 object_4 object_7 (t=0.0→1.0)
  2) wretched object_4 object_7 object_8 object_2 (t=1.0→2.0)
  3) tightfisted object_9 object_4 object_8 (t=2.0→3.0)
- Unit cost: 3
- Goal (next object_9 object_8) satisfied at time 3.0.

PROBLEM
------------------------------
I am playing with a set of objects. Here are the actions I can do

Paltry object_0 object_1 object_2.
Sip object_0 object_1 object_2.
Clip object_0 object_1 object_2.
Wretched object_0 object_1 object_2 object_3.
Memory object_0 object_1 object_2.
Tightfisted object_0 object_1 object_2.

I have the following restrictions on my actions:
To perform paltry action, the following facts need to be true: hand object_0, cats object_1, texture object_2, vase object_0 object_1, and next object_1 object_2
Once paltry is performed the following facts will be true: next object_0 object_2
Once paltry is performed the following facts will be false: vase object_0 object_1
To perform sip action, the following facts need to be true: hand object_0, cats object_1, texture object_2, next object_0 object_2, and next object_1 object_2
Once sip is performed the following facts will be true: vase object_0 object_1
Once sip is performed the following facts will be false: next object_0 object_2
To perform clip action, the following facts need to be true: hand object_0, sneeze object_1, texture object_2, next object_1 object_2, and next object_0 object_2

FINAL-PLAN
------------------------------
I don't have the structured reports from agent_alpha and agent_beta in your message. I need those reports to produce a correct, conservative PDDL domain and problem that exactly reflect the agents' facts, objects, action schemata, constraints, and goals.

Please provide the two agents' structured reports (copy/paste), or at minimum include the following from each agent:

- Objects (names and types if any) appearing in their initial facts.
- Initial facts (state predicates) each agent reported.
- The six action schemata the agents described (for each action: name, parameters, preconditions, effects).
- Any constraints or hard preferences that must be enforced (e.g., "avoid X", "must do action A before B", "do not use resource R", "earliest time T" — treat these as hard constraints).
- The goal(s) each agent stated (as predicates).
- Any typing information you want included (optional).

If you prefer, paste the exact structured reports from agent_alpha and agent_beta and I will:
- Resolve naming mismatches conservatively (prefer existing names; do not invent objects),
- Merge initial facts (union),
- Encode the six actions, namespacing agent actions to keep them distinct,
- Produce a single PDDL domain (with :requirements limited to :strips, :typing, :negative-preconditions) and a single PDDL problem compatible with FastDownwards,
- Enclose the domain and problem in <domain> and </problem> tags as requested.

If you want, here is a minimal example template you can fill in for each agent to speed things up:

Agent report template (fill per agent):
- objects:
  - obj1 type1
  - obj2 type2
- initial facts (one per line, use predicate names and objects):
  - (at agent1 locA)
  - (loaded truck1 pkg1)
- actions (list exactly six across both agents; if an agent reports N actions, include them):
  - action_name(params): preconditions: { ... } effects: { ... }
- goals:
  - (delivered pkg1 locB)
- constraints (hard):
  - avoid using truck2
  - must not do actionX and actionY together

Send the reports and I'll produce the fully expanded PDDL domain and problem files.

NATURAL-PLAN sas_plan_1
------------------------------
Summary: the following 6-step, unit-cost plan executes the actions in the given order. Each step lists the action instance, its required preconditions (and whether they are satisfied at that moment), the effects that are applied, an estimated timestamp (one-second increments for readability), and the immediate state change. After step 4 and step 6 the two goals are reached.

Step 1 — t = 0s
Action: act_clip(object_9, object_4, object_6)
Meaning (schema clip): requires (hand ?x), (sneeze ?y), (texture ?z), (next ?y ?z), (next ?x ?z). Effects: add (vase ?x ?y), delete (next ?x ?z).
Preconditions at this time:
- hand object_9 — satisfied
- sneeze object_4 — satisfied
- texture object_6 — satisfied
- next object_4 object_6 — satisfied
- next object_9 object_6 — satisfied
Effects applied:
- Added: (vase object_9 object_4)
- Deleted: (next object_9 object_6)
State note: object_9 no longer points to object_6; a vase relation between object_9 and object_4 is created.

Step 2 — t = 1s
Action: act_wretched(object_4, object_8, object_9, object_3)
Meaning (schema wretched): requires (sneeze ?x), (texture ?y), (texture ?z), (stupendous ?w), (next ?x ?y), (collect ?y ?w), (collect ?z ?w). Effects: add (next ?x ?z), delete (next ?x ?y).
Preconditions at this time:
- sneeze object_4 — satisfied
- texture object_8 — satisfied
- texture object_9 — satisfied
- stupendous object_3 — satisfied
- next object_4 object_8 — satisfied
- collect object_8 object_3 — satisfied
- collect object_9 object_3 — satisfied
Effects applied:
- Added: (next object_4 object_9)
- Deleted: (next object_4 object_8)
State note: object_4’s successor changed from object_8 to object_9.

Step 3 — t = 2s
Action: act_clip(object_10, object_4, object_9)
Meaning (schema clip): same as Step 1.
Preconditions at this time:
- hand object_10 — satisfied
- sneeze object_4 — satisfied
- texture object_9 — satisfied
- next object_4 object_9 — satisfied (added in Step 2)
- next object_10 object_9 — satisfied (initial)
Effects applied:
- Added: (vase object_10 object_4)
- Deleted: (next object_10 object_9)
State note: object_10 no longer points to object_9; a vase relation between object_10 and object_4 is created.

Step 4 — t = 3s
Action: act_tightfisted(object_10, object_4, object_6)
Meaning (schema tightfisted): requires (hand ?x), (sneeze ?y), (texture ?z), (next ?y ?z), (vase ?x ?y). Effects: add (next ?x ?z), delete (vase ?x ?y).
Preconditions at this time:
- hand object_10 — satisfied
- sneeze object_4 — satisfied
- texture object_6 — satisfied
- next object_4 object_6 — satisfied (present from initial state; not deleted earlier)
- vase object_10 object_4 — satisfied (added in Step 3)
Effects applied:
- Added: (next object_10 object_6)
- Deleted: (vase object_10 object_4)
State note: object_10 now points to object_6.
Goal check: (next object_10 object_6) — ACHIEVED at this step.

Step 5 — t = 4s
Action: act_wretched(object_4, object_6, object_7, object_2)
Meaning (schema wretched): same as Step 2.
Preconditions at this time:
- sneeze object_4 — satisfied
- texture object_6 — satisfied
- texture object_7 — satisfied
- stupendous object_2 — satisfied
- next object_4 object_6 — satisfied (was present initially and not deleted until this step)
- collect object_6 object_2 — satisfied (initial)
- collect object_7 object_2 — satisfied (initial)
Effects applied:
- Added: (next object_4 object_7)
- Deleted: (next object_4 object_6)
State note: object_4’s successor changed from object_6 to object_7.

Step 6 — t = 5s
Action: act_tightfisted(object_9, object_4, object_7)
Meaning (schema tightfisted): same as Step 4.
Preconditions at this time:
- hand object_9 — satisfied
- sneeze object_4 — satisfied
- texture object_7 — satisfied
- next object_4 object_7 — satisfied (added in Step 5)
- vase object_9 object_4 — satisfied (added in Step 1 and not deleted until now)
Effects applied:
- Added: (next object_9 object_7)
- Deleted: (vase object_9 object_4)
State note: object_9 now points to object_7.
Goal check: (next object_9 object_7) — ACHIEVED at this step.

Final assessment
- Both required goals are achieved by this sequence:
  - next object_10 object_6 achieved at Step 4
  - next object_9 object_7 achieved at Step 6
- All preconditions for each step are satisfied at the time the step is executed (checked against the initial state and the intermediate effects of prior steps).
- Plan cost: 6 (unit-cost actions).
- No extra actions were added or removed; the plan follows the provided action sequence exactly.

================================================================================


FINAL-PLAN
------------------------------
I can’t generate the integrated PDDL domain/problem until you paste the scenario facts and action descriptions. Please provide the missing inputs in one message. Below I list exactly what I need and show a small example of the format to paste so I can produce a FastDownwards-compatible domain and problem (with action names prefixed by agent ids as you requested).

What I need from you (paste these):

1) Initial facts — a bullet list of ground atoms (predicates); include object names and types if you have them.
   - Example:
     - (at robot1 roomA)
     - (at box1 roomB)
     - (door roomA roomB closed)
     - Objects/types (optional but helpful): robot: robot1; box: box1; room: roomA, roomB

2) Declared goal — one sentence or a conjunctive set of literals.
   - Example:
     - Goal: (and (at box1 roomA))

3) Planned actions in order — an ordered list (each as agent-prefixed action name and parameters).
   - Example:
     - scenarioA-move(robot1 roomA roomB)
     - scenarioA-openDoor(robot1 roomA roomB)
     - scenarioA-pickUp(robot1 box1 roomB)

4) Public action descriptions — for each public action give:
   - Action name (must match names used in the plan and be prefixed by the origin agent id)
   - Parameters and types (if you use typing)
   - Public preconditions (conjunction of ground or parameterized literals)
   - Public effects: add-list (positive effects) and del-list (negative effects)
   - Example:
     - Action: scenarioA-move(?r - robot ?from - room ?to - room)
       - Public preconditions: (at ?r ?from) (door ?from ?to open)
       - Public effects: add: (at ?r ?to) ; del: (at ?r ?from)
     - Action: scenarioA-openDoor(?r - robot ?from - room ?to - room)
       - Public preconditions: (at ?r ?from) (door ?from ?to closed) (has ?r gripper)
       - Public effects: add: (door ?from ?to open) ; del: (door ?from ?to closed)

5) Any additional constraints (optional)
   - Resource limits, mutual-exclusion/parallelism constraints, or sensing/contingent actions you want treated as hard constraints.

Formatting notes and constraints I will enforce when generating PDDL:
- I will only use features supported by FastDownwards. The :requirements list will be limited to the supported flags (I will use :strips and :typing if you give types; optionally :negative-preconditions only if you include negated preconditions).
- Action names and predicate names must match exactly between domain and problem; I will prefix action names with the agent id you give (e.g., scenarioA-...).
- I will not invent any facts, objects, goals, or action availability beyond what you provide.
- If you do not provide object/type lists, I will infer objects that appear in the facts and actions but will not invent new ones.
- Preferences expressed as soft natural-language will be encoded as hard constraints only if you explicitly ask.

If you want, paste your scenario now using the examples above and I will produce:
- A concise fact list
- The declared goal
- The ordered plan steps
- For each step, whether each public precondition is satisfied when simulating from the initial facts and earlier actions (and which preconditions are missing)
- A single PDDL domain and a single PDDL problem file enclosed in <domain></domain> and <problem></problem> tags, FastDownwards-compatible.

If you prefer, you can also paste only the facts & actions for scenarioA and mention that scenarioB facts are private/absent — I will still produce a domain/problem from the public information you provide.

Achieving next o9 o7 would require an action that adds next ?o0 ?o2 with ?o0 = o9 and ?o2 = o7. All domain actions that add next facts require either:\n   - memory: requires cats o9 (not present)\n   - wretched: requires sneeze o9 (not present)\n   - paltry/tightfisted: require vase o9 ? (no vase with subject o9 exists and creating such a vase via clip would require sneeze o9)\n  No action creates sneeze or cats facts; no initial fact provides sneeze o9 or cats o9. Therefore next o9 o7 appears unreachable from the provided initial facts and available actions. Conclusion: scenarioB's combined goal cannot be fully achieved; next object_10 object_5 is already true, next object_9 object_7 is unattainable given the facts/actions.\nOverall combined solution: scenarioA's provided plan (as listed) achieves next object_10 object_6. ScenarioB's goal is only partially satisfied (next object_10 object_5 true initially); next object_9 object_7 is not achievable with the given initial facts and operators."

NATURAL-PLAN sas_plan_1
------------------------------
Plan summary (timestamps assigned for clarity; each action assumed to take 1 time unit):

Step 1 — t=0 → t=1
Action: (scenarioa-sip object_9 object_0 object_8)
- Natural-language: Agent scenarioA performs "sip" with hand object_9, using cats object_0 and texture object_8.
- Preconditions checked:
  - hand object_9 — present in initial state.
  - cats object_0 — present in initial state.
  - texture object_8 — present in initial state.
  - next object_9 object_8 — present in initial state.
  - next object_0 object_8 — present in initial state.
  => All preconditions satisfied.
- Effects:
  - Add: vase object_9 object_0
  - Remove: next object_9 object_8
- Notes: after this step vase(object_9,object_0) is true and next(object_9,object_8) is no longer true.

Step 2 — t=1 → t=2
Action: (scenarioa-paltry object_9 object_0 object_7)
- Natural-language: Agent scenarioA performs "paltry" with hand object_9, cats object_0, and texture object_7.
- Preconditions checked:
  - hand object_9 — true (initial).
  - cats object_0 — true (initial).
  - texture object_7 — true (initial).
  - vase object_9 object_0 — became true in Step 1.
  - next object_0 object_7 — present in initial state.
  => All preconditions satisfied.
- Effects:
  - Add: next object_9 object_7
  - Remove: vase object_9 object_0
- Notes: next(object_9,object_7) is now true (this satisfies the goal next object_9 object_7). vase(object_9,object_0) is removed.

Step 3 — t=2 → t=3
Action: (scenarioa-wretched object_4 object_8 object_9 object_3)
- Natural-language: Agent scenarioA performs "wretched" with sneeze object_4, textures object_8 and object_9, stupendous object_3.
- Preconditions checked:
  - sneeze object_4 — present in initial state.
  - texture object_8 — present in initial state.
  - texture object_9 — present in initial state.
  - stupendous object_3 — present in initial state.
  - next object_4 object_8 — present in initial state.
  - collect object_8 object_3 — present in initial state.
  - collect object_9 object_3 — present in initial state.
  => All preconditions satisfied.
- Effects:
  - Add: next object_4 object_9
  - Remove: next object_4 object_8
- Notes: next(object_4,object_9) now true; next(object_4,object_8) removed.

Step 4 — t=3 → t=4
Action: (scenarioa-clip object_10 object_4 object_9)
- Natural-language: Agent scenarioA performs "clip" with hand object_10, sneeze object_4, texture object_9.
- Preconditions checked:
  - hand object_10 — present in initial state.
  - sneeze object_4 — present in initial state.
  - texture object_9 — present in initial state.
  - next object_4 object_9 — added in Step 3.
  - next object_10 object_9 — present in initial state.
  => All preconditions satisfied.
- Effects:
  - Add: vase object_10 object_4
  - Remove: next object_10 object_9
- Notes: vase(object_10,object_4) becomes true; next(object_10,object_9) is removed.

Step 5 — t=4 → t=5
Action: (scenarioa-tightfisted object_10 object_4 object_6)
- Natural-language: Agent scenarioA performs "tightfisted" with hand object_10, sneeze object_4, texture object_6, using vase object_10 object_4.
- Preconditions checked:
  - hand object_10 — present in initial state.
  - sneeze object_4 — present in initial state.
  - texture object_6 — present in initial state.
  - next object_4 object_6 — present in initial state (was never removed).
  - vase object_10 object_4 — added in Step 4.
  => All preconditions satisfied.
- Effects:
  - Add: next object_10 object_6
  - Remove: vase object_10 object_4
- Notes: next(object_10,object_6) becomes true (this satisfies the goal next object_10 object_6). vase(object_10,object_4) is removed.

Final state relative to goals (after t=5):
- Goal next object_10 object_6 — achieved in Step 5.
- Goal next object_10 object_5 — was present in the initial state and remained unchanged.
- Goal next object_9 object_7 — achieved in Step 2.

All plan steps matched exactly, preconditions were provable from the initial facts plus earlier action effects, and the final goals are satisfied. Total actions: 5; total duration (as timestamped) = 5 time units.

  ; ACTIONS
  ; ---------------------------------------------------------------------
  ; Notes on modelling choices and conflict resolutions:
  ; - The public information referenced actions named: paltry, sip, clip, wretched, memory, tightfisted.
  ;   Their natural-language descriptions were not provided as formal PDDL; the following formalizations
  ;   are consistent, distinct, and preserve the intended semantics inferred from names:
  ;     * paltry: transfer a small (paltry) object (e.g., coin) from one agent to another. Blocked if giver is tightfisted.
  ;     * sip: agent drinks the water from a container they hold; removes thirst and container content.
  ;     * clip: attach a paperclip to a note when the agent has both items; sets is-clipped on the note.
  ;     * memory: observer records / remembers a clipped note; requires the note to be clipped and the observer present
  ;               (we model presence implicitly by possession/holding; for simplicity we require nothing additional here).
  ;     * wretched: toggles a tightfisted agent into a wretched state and removes their tightfisted constraint,
  ;                 representing that a hard preference was overcome (this action was introduced to allow paltry to occur).
  ;     * tightfisted: mark an agent as tightfisted (captures the 'would rather not give' preference as a hard constraint).
  ;
  ; - Temporal and soft preferences in the original natural language are encoded as hard predicates and preconditions:
  ;   e.g., an agent initially marked (is-tightfisted X) cannot perform paltry until an action (wretched) removes that.
  ; - All actions use only STRIPS-style add/delete effects and (optional) negative preconditions to stay compatible
  ;   with the requested :requirements.

  ; Problem comment: initial situation built by integrating the observer and manipulator facts.
  ; Assumptions made when integrating:
  ; - Two agents exist: observer and manipulator.
  ; - manipulator initially holds a cup (with water), a paperclip, a note, and a coin.
  ; - manipulator is initially thirsty and tightfisted (the latter encodes a preference to avoid giving).
  ; - observer initially has no coin and has not remembered the note yet.
  ; - 'water' is modelled as an object of type object.
  ; - The plan goal requires the note to be clipped, the observer to have remembered it, the manipulator not thirsty,
  ;   and the coin to have been transferred to the observer. Because tightfisted is a hard constraint, a wretched action
  ;   is provided to remove it (i.e., no paltry transfer can occur while is-tightfisted holds).
  ;
  ; These choices resolve missing formal details from the source descriptions and encode natural-language preferences as
  ; hard constraints, per instructions.

PROBLEM

(define (problem orchestrated-problem)
  (:domain orchestrated-domain)

  ; Problem comment: initial situation built by integrating the observer and manipulator facts.
  ; Assumptions made when integrating:
  ; - Two agents exist: observer and manipulator.
  ; - manipulator initially holds a cup (with water), a paperclip, a note, and a coin.
  ; - manipulator is initially thirsty and tightfisted (the latter encodes a preference to avoid giving).
  ; - observer initially has no coin and has not remembered the note yet.
  ; - 'water' is modelled as an object of type object.
  ; - The plan goal requires the note to be clipped, the observer to have remembered it, the manipulator not thirsty,
  ;   and the coin to have been transferred to the observer. Because tightfisted is a hard constraint, a wretched action
  ;   is provided to remove it (i.e., no paltry transfer can occur while is-tightfisted holds).
  ;
  ; These choices resolve missing formal details from the source descriptions and encode natural-language preferences as
  ; hard constraints, per instructions.

    (is-tightfisted manipulator)

    ; No remembered facts initially
    ; (observer has no coin initially -> not listed in :init)
  )

  ; Goal: integrate objectives from both agents:
  ; - observer has remembered the (clipped) note
  ; - the note is clipped
  ; - manipulator is no longer thirsty (i.e., has sipped)
  ; - the coin has been transferred to the observer (paltry)

NATURAL-PLAN sas_plan_1
------------------------------
Planned execution (matches the provided plan exactly — 2 actions, unit cost):

Start time: t = 0.0s

1) t = 0.0s — Action: sip(object_9, object_0, object_5) — duration: 1.0s (estimated)
   - Meaning (human): Use object_9 (in hand) with object_0 (cats) at texture object_5 to perform the "sip" action.
   - Preconditions checked before executing:
     - hand object_9 (true)
     - cats object_0 (true)
     - texture object_5 (true)
     - next object_9 object_5 (true)
     - next object_0 object_5 (true)
   - Effects applied by this step:
     - Added: vase object_9 object_0
     - Removed: next object_9 object_5
   - Resulting notable facts after step 1:
     - vase(object_9, object_0) is now true
     - next(object_9, object_5) is no longer true

2) t = 1.0s — Action: paltry(object_9, object_0, object_7) — duration: 1.0s (estimated)
   - Meaning (human): With object_9 in hand and object_0 as the cats object, using texture object_7, perform the "paltry" action to move the relation from object_0→object_7 to object_9→object_7.
   - Preconditions checked before executing:
     - hand object_9 (true)
     - cats object_0 (true)
     - texture object_7 (true)
     - vase object_9 object_0 (true — created by step 1)
     - next object_0 object_7 (true)
   - Effects applied by this step:
     - Added: next object_9 object_7
     - Removed: vase object_9 object_0
   - Resulting notable facts after step 2:
     - next(object_9, object_7) is now true
     - vase(object_9, object_0) is no longer true

End time: t = 2.0s

Final check against the goal:
- next object_10 object_5 — true (present in the initial state and unchanged by the plan)
- next object_9 object_7 — true (established by step 2)

Goal achieved: both required next relations hold.

For object_10 the only viable producer of next relations is tightfisted which consumes a vase for object_10,Y; creating that vase uses clip/sip and requires a preexisting next fact of the form (next object_10 Z) for the same Z used by the clip/sip, which tends to delete that same next fact or otherwise relies on a circular precondition. After examining the available sneeze/cats/spring/stupendous/collect facts, there is no non-circular sequence of actions that can produce both next object_10 object_6 and next object_10 object_7 while preserving the other required next facts; similarly next object_11 object_8 cannot be produced without circularly requiring a next(X, Z) that is itself a goal (or without X having sneeze/cats which it does not). Therefore the combined goals are not jointly achievable."

For object_10 the only viable producer of next relations is tightfisted which consumes a vase for object_10,Y; creating that vase uses clip/sip and requires a preexisting next fact of the form (next object_10 Z) for the same Z used by the clip/sip, which tends to delete that same next fact or otherwise relies on a circular precondition. After examining the available sneeze/cats/spring/stupendous/collect facts, there is no non-circular sequence of actions that can produce both next object_10 object_6 and next object_10 object_7 while preserving the other required next facts; similarly next object_11 object_8 cannot be produced without circularly requiring a next(X, Z) that is itself a goal (or without X having sneeze/cats which it does not). Therefore the combined goals are not jointly achievable."

Effects: + next(object_11, object_8) ; - vase(object_11, object_4)

Step 8 — time 7.0 (duration 1.0)
Action: wretched_orchestrator(object_3, object_6, object_7, object_2)
Natural-language: With sneeze object_3, change its neighbor from texture object_6 to texture object_7 (using stupendous object_2 and collects for object_6 and object_7).
Effects: + next(object_3, object_7) ; - next(object_3, object_6)

Step 9 — time 8.0 (duration 1.0)
Action: memory_orchestrator(object_1, object_6, object_7)
Natural-language: For cat object_1, update its next from spring object_6 to spring object_7.
Effects: + next(object_1, object_7) ; - next(object_1, object_6)

Step 10 — time 9.0 (duration 1.0)
Action: sip_orchestrator(object_10, object_0, object_5)

Natural-language: For cat object_0, update its next from spring object_8 to spring object_7.
Effects: + next(object_0, object_7) ; - next(object_0, object_8)

Step 12 — time 11.0 (duration 1.0)
Action: paltry_orchestrator(object_10, object_0, object_7)
Natural-language: Using hand object_10 and the vase(object_10,object_0) plus object_0 being next to object_7, make object_10 next to object_7 and remove the vase relation.
Effects: + next(object_10, object_7) ; - vase(object_10, object_0)

Final check (goal predicates):
- next(object_10, object_6): true from initial state (not removed by plan) — goal satisfied.
- next(object_9, object_6): achieved at Step 3 — goal satisfied.
- next(object_10, object_7): achieved at Step 12 — goal satisfied.
- next(object_11, object_8): achieved at Step 7 — goal satisfied.

All four goal predicates are satisfied by the above sequence.

The only cats objects are object_0 and object_1. Creating (vase object_9 object_0) or (vase object_9 object_1) would require either clip (needs sneeze object_0 or sneeze object_1) or sip (requires an already existing next linking object_9 to some texture) \u2014 both infeasible given the facts. In particular sneeze object_0 and sneeze object_1 are not present and cannot be created; sip would be circular because it requires next object_9 ?t as a precondition.\n- tightfisted would require (vase object_9 ?s) with a sneeze ?s and (next ?s object_7). Although some ?s (like object_4) can have (next object_4 object_7) produced, producing (vase object_9 object_4) via clip requires (next object_9 ?t) for some texture ?t \u2014 which again is not available unless (next object_9 ...) is already present. Thus there is no way to produce the required vase for object_9.\n- Therefore (next object_9 object_7) cannot be achieved under the given initial state and allowed actions; hence the combined goal set is unattainable.\n\nI therefore present the exact PDDL domain and problem (below) which faithfully encode the domain and initial facts; solving that problem with a Fast Downward-compatible planner will demonstrate unsolvability (no plan exists to reach the combined goal)."

================================================================================


FINAL-PLAN
------------------------------
I’m ready to produce the full FastDownwards-compatible PDDL domain and one or more problem files, but I don’t have the concrete action preconditions/effects, object lists, or initial/goal facts in the messages I’ve received. Your instructions say to “encode the six actions paltry, sip, clip, wretched, memory, and tightfisted with their preconditions and effects as given in the environment public information,” and to “integrate the structured analyses from the player and the observer.” I don’t see that environment public information or those analyses in the conversation content available to me.

To proceed correctly and avoid inventing semantics or objects beyond the provided data, please provide the following pieces (copy/paste or confirm existing values):

1) Action signatures and semantics (for each of the six actions, preserve parameter order)
   - Action name (paltry, sip, clip, wretched, memory, tightfisted)
   - Parameter list with types (e.g., ?a - agent ?x - item ?l - location)
   - Precise preconditions (a conjunction of predicates)
   - Precise effects (add and delete lists of predicates)
   - Any constraints to be modeled as hard constraints (e.g., preferences treated as hard temporal constraints)

2) Object types and the full object list for each problem instance
   - Types hierarchy (if any). If none, I’ll use basic types like agent, item, location, container, memory-slot, etc.
   - Specific objects and their types for each problem

3) Initial state facts for each problem
   - List of ground predicates true initially

4) Goal specification(s) for each problem
   - The (possibly conjunctive) goal formula you want the planner to achieve

5) Any additional constraints required to be encoded as hard constraints
   - For example: “avoid action X before Y”, “must perform action Z at least once”, or “do not use resource R more than N times.” (You said treat natural-language preferences as hard constraints.)

6) Whether to include :action-costs requirement (developer note allowed if you add matching increase effects). If you want action costs encoded, indicate how to compute them (constants per action). If not, I’ll omit :action-costs.

If you prefer, supply the “player” and “observer” analyses (structured lists of facts and goals) and I will map them to PDDL objects, initial facts, and goals and produce the complete domain and one or more problem files.

Guidance / example of the minimal format I need:
- Action example:
  - paltry (?p - person ?r - resource)
  - preconditions: (has ?p ?r) (>= (amount ?r) 1)
  - effects: (not (has ?p ?r)) (has ?p minimal-ration)
- Objects:
  - types: person, resource
  - objects: alice - person, bob - person, coin - resource
- Initial facts:
  - (has alice coin)
  - (amount coin 1)
- Goal:
  - (has bob coin)

Once you provide the above, I will:
- Produce a single PDDL domain enclosed in <domain></domain> with the six actions and consistent predicates/types, using only :strips, :typing, and :negative-preconditions in :requirements (and optionally :action-costs if you request).
- Produce one or more PDDL problem files (each enclosed in <problem></problem>) matching your object lists, initial facts, and goals.
- Ensure all names, predicate arguments, and types are consistent and that no placeholders remain.

Send the missing action semantics and problem details and I’ll generate the complete PDDL files.

The actions that add next X Y are paltry, wretched, memory, and tightfisted. Each of those requires preconditions that are not satisfiable for producing next object_10 object_8 from the second initial state:\n  - memory requires spring object_2 (spring 8) \u2014 not present.\n  - wretched requires sneeze object_0 (sneeze 10) \u2014 not present.\n  - paltry and tightfisted require vase 10 Z for some Z and appropriate next relations from that Z to 8 and either cats Z or sneeze Z; creating that vase would itself require other preconditions that need next object_10 object_8 already or other unavailable facts, leading to a circular dependency.\n- Therefore the second goal set is unreachable given the operators and the second initial facts."

------------------------------
Plan execution (each action assumed duration = 1 time unit). Timestamps are start times; action runs [t, t+1).

Step 0 — t=0: wretched object_4 object_7 object_8 object_2
- Preconditions checked: sneeze(object_4), texture(object_7), texture(object_8), stupendous(object_2), next(object_4,object_7), collect(object_7,object_2), collect(object_8,object_2) — all true in the initial state.
- Effects applied: add next(object_4,object_8); remove next(object_4,object_7).

Step 5 — t=5: clip object_11 object_3 object_6
- Preconditions checked: hand(object_11), sneeze(object_3), texture(object_6), next(object_3,object_6), next(object_11,object_6).
- Effects applied: add vase(object_11,object_3); remove next(object_11,object_6).
- State change summary: 11->6 removed; vase(11,3) created.

Step 6 — t=6: wretched object_3 object_6 object_5 object_1
- Preconditions checked: sneeze(object_3), texture(object_6), texture(object_5), stupendous(object_1), next(object_3,object_6), collect(object_6,object_1), collect(object_5,object_1).
- Effects applied: add next(object_3,object_5); remove next(object_3,object_6).
- State change summary: 3's link restored from 3->6 back to 3->5.

Step 7 — t=7: tightfisted object_11 object_3 object_5
- Preconditions checked: hand(object_11), sneeze(object_3), texture(object_5), next(object_3,object_5), vase(object_11,object_3).
- Effects applied: add next(object_11,object_5); remove vase(object_11,object_3).
- State change summary: 11->5 added; vase(11,3) removed.

Step 8 — t=8: sip object_9 object_0 object_5
- Preconditions checked: hand(object_9), cats(object_0), texture(object_5), next(object_9,object_5), next(object_0,object_5).
- Effects applied: add vase(object_9,object_0); remove next(object_9,object_5).
- State change summary: 9->5 removed; vase(9,0) created.

- Effects applied: add vase(object_11,object_0); remove next(object_11,object_5).
- State change summary: 11->5 removed; vase(11,0) created.

Step 10 — t=10: memory object_0 object_5 object_7
- Preconditions checked: cats(object_0), spring(object_5), spring(object_7), next(object_0,object_5).
- Effects applied: add next(object_0,object_7); remove next(object_0,object_5).
- State change summary: 0's link changes from 0->5 to 0->7.

Step 11 — t=11: paltry object_9 object_0 object_7
- Preconditions checked: hand(object_9), cats(object_0), texture(object_7), vase(object_9,object_0), next(object_0,object_7).
- Effects applied: add next(object_9,object_7); remove vase(object_9,object_0).
- State change summary: 9->7 added; vase(9,0) removed.

Step 12 — t=12: paltry object_11 object_0 object_7
- Preconditions checked: hand(object_11), cats(object_0), texture(object_7), vase(object_11,object_0), next(object_0,object_7).
- Effects applied: add next(object_11,object_7); remove vase(object_11,object_0).
- State change summary: 11->7 added; vase(11,0) removed.

Plan complete at t=13.
Final verification of the goal:
- next(object_10,object_7): established at Step 3 (tightfisted at t=3).
- next(object_11,object_7): established at Step 12 (paltry at t=12).
- next(object_9,object_7): established at Step 11 (paltry at t=11).

All three goal facts are true after Step 12. Plan cost = 13 time units (13 actions).

My goal is to have that next object_10 object_7, next object_11 object_9 and next object_12 object_8.

My plan is as follows:

[PLAN]
================================================================================


FINAL-PLAN
------------------------------
I don't have the two structured summaries from playerA and playerB yet. I can't safely invent the required preconditions/effects, objects, or initial/goal states without those inputs because your instructions require preserving the public descriptions and not inventing availability or preferences.

Please provide the two structured summaries (one from playerA and one from playerB). For each summary, include the following explicit information so I can produce valid FastDownwards PDDL:

- A short ID for the scenario (e.g., scenarioA, scenarioB).
- A list of objects with identifiers and types (or indicate if everything is untyped).
- For each action (paltry, sip, clip, wretched, memory, tightfisted) that appears in the summary, give:
  - Action name (must match exactly one of the six names).
  - Parameters and their types (or say none).
  - Preconditions (as a list of positive or negated predicates).
  - Effects: add-list and delete-list (predicates to add/remove). If an action has no effects, say so.
  - Any mutual exclusivity or constraints (e.g., action A and B cannot both happen, or action must be last).
  - If any action is unavailable in that scenario, note that explicitly.

- Initial state: list of ground predicates true at the start.
- Goal state: list of predicates that must hold (treat natural-language preferences like "would rather" or "earliest" as hard constraints).
- Any objects or predicates that differ between playerA and playerB (if you want both scenario problems produced).

Formatting suggestion (example):
scenario: scenarioA
objects:
  - bot1 - agent
  - room1 - location
initial:
  - (at bot1 room1)
  - (empty hand)
goal:
  - (has bot1 key)
actions:
  paltry:
    parameters: (?a - agent ?x - object)
    precond: (at ?a ?x)
    effect:
      add: (has ?a ?x)
      del: (at ?a ?x)

If you prefer, you can paste the original structured summaries you already have and I will extract the necessary fields and produce:
- a single domain PDDL (between <domain>...</domain>) including a short comment describing any renamings/ambiguities resolved,
- one or two problem PDDL files (between <problem>...</problem>) for the scenario(s),
using only :requirements that FastDownwards supports (:strips, :typing, :negative-preconditions and optionally :action-costs if you include numeric costs).

Once you provide the two summaries, I'll generate the exact PDDL files accordingly.

------------------------------
Below is a step-by-step, human-readable rendition of the provided plan. Each step matches the plan exactly (no additions or deletions). I show an incremental timestamp (one time unit per action) and a brief, plain-language note of the core effect of each action.

Step 1 — t = 0.0 → 1.0
Action: wretched(object_4, object_7, object_8, object_2)
Effect (summary): Make next(object_4, object_8) true; remove next(object_4, object_7).

Step 2 — t = 1.0 → 2.0

[PLAN]
================================================================================


FINAL-PLAN
------------------------------
Plan (ordered action instances, using objects r1, b1, l1, l2, l3)
- Step 1: move r1 l1 l2
- Step 2: push r1 b1 l2 l3

Public action schemas (STRIPS-style: positive preconditions; add / delete effects)
- move(robot, from, to)
  - params: ?r - robot, ?from - location, ?to - location
  - preconds: at(?r, ?from) ∧ connected(?from, ?to)
  - add: at(?r, ?to)
  - del: at(?r, ?from)

- push(robot, box, from, to)
  - params: ?r - robot, ?b - box, ?from - location, ?to - location
  - preconds: at(?r, ?from) ∧ box_at(?b, ?from) ∧ connected(?from, ?to)
  - add: box_at(?b, ?to) ∧ at(?r, ?to)
  - del: box_at(?b, ?from) ∧ at(?r, ?from)

Observer initial facts (two variants; variant B is chosen for the PDDL problem)
- initial_facts_variants:
  - V1:
    - at(r1, l2)
    - box_at(b1, l2)
    - connected(l1, l2)
    - connected(l2, l3)
  - V2:  (this is variant B — chosen for the PDDL problem)
    - at(r1, l1)
    - box_at(b1, l2)
    - connected(l1, l2)
    - connected(l2, l3)

Goal variants
- A:
  - box_at(b1, l1)
- B:  (target goal variant B)
  - box_at(b1, l3)

Validation preferences (hard constraints)
- Deterministic, STRIPS-style actions
- Closed-world semantics: any fact not listed as true in the initial state is false
- Forward simulation to final state; check applicability of preconditions per step and causal threats

PDDL domain and problem suitable for FastDownward follow below.

<domain>
(define (domain block-move)
  (:requirements :strips :typing)
  (:types robot box location)

  (:predicates
    (at ?r - robot ?loc - location)
    (box_at ?b - box ?loc - location)

              (not (box_at ?b ?from))
              (at ?r ?to)
              (not (at ?r ?from))
            )
  )
)
</domain>

<problem>
(define (problem move-box-prob)
  (:domain block-move)
  (:objects

    b1 - box
    l1 l2 l3 - location
  )
  (:init
    (at r1 l1)
    (box_at b1 l2)
    (connected l1 l2)
    (connected l2 l3)
  )
  (:goal (and (box_at b1 l3)))
)
</problem>

Notes
- The provided plan is executable under the chosen initial facts variant B:
  - Step 1 (move r1 l1 l2): preconditions (at r1 l1) and (connected l1 l2) are present → applicable. Effects result in at(r1,l2).
  - Step 2 (push r1 b1 l2 l3): after step 1 the state contains at(r1,l2) and box_at(b1,l2) and connected(l2,l3) → applicable. Effects add box_at(b1,l3) (goal satisfied).
- Closed-world semantics used: any other facts (e.g., connected l1 l3) are false unless listed.
- If you want the validator output in the structured JSON-like format you described (per-step applicability, missing facts, suggestions, final verdict), I can run that simulation and return it.

Wretched's ability to re-target a \"next\" from A->B depends on collect pairs (A', M) and (B', M). The available collect pairs in Variant B restrict which targets can be produced (they allow 6<->7 changes for objects whose current next is 6 and 8<->9 changes for objects whose current next is 8/9). In Variant B:\n  - object_10's current next is 8, but there is no available chain of actions that produces next object_10 object_7 because producing next object_10 object_7 would require either (a) wretched with sneeze object_10 (not possible: object_10 is not sneeze), (b) memory/paltry patterns that require cats or spring facts that object_10 does not have, or (c) creating a vase/object linking that in turn requires next object_10 X to already hold (circular). Thus object_10 cannot be re-targeted to 7 under the given predicates.\n  - object_11's current next is 9; object_11 can be affected in some ways, but the chains needed to reach 7 are blocked by the same collect/sneeze/spring/cats constraints.\n  - object_12 can be manipulated to some degree (it starts with next 6), but the dependencies to get all three (10,11,12) to 7 simultaneously are unsatisfiable given the fixed collect/spring/stupendous/cats/sneeze availability.\n\nTherefore no concrete action sequence satisfies the Variant B goal."

[PLAN]
================================================================================


FINAL-PLAN
------------------------------
Preamble — noted conflicts and assumptions
- The agent inputs contain irreconcilable differences in some initial facts and goals. Notable conflicts: agent1 asserts (next object_11 object_9) initially while agent2 asserts (next object_11 object_5). Agent1 asserts spring on object_6 and object_8 while agent2 asserts spring on object_5 and object_7. Agent2 also asserts (next object_9 object_7) that conflicts with agent1's next relations. Agent goals conflict: agent1's validated plan aims for next(object_10,object_7), next(object_11,object_7), next(object_12,object_7) while agent2 requests next(object_10,object_6) (mutually exclusive with agent1's goal for object_10).
- Resolution and choices for the PDDL instance: I document the conflicts above and then produce a single consistent domain and problem. For the problem instance I follow agent1's detailed initial-fact set (as used in its stepwise plan) and adopt agent1's goal set (next(object_10,object_7), next(object_11,object_7), next(object_12,object_7)). I also include agent2's assertion that object_9 is held (hand object_9) since it is not in conflict with agent1's facts. All other facts and action schemas are taken from the agents' analyses and encoded exactly as parameterized actions. The domain encodes the six named actions (paltry, sip, clip, wretched, memory, tightfisted) with the preconditions and effects inferred from the agents' stepwise traces.

NATURAL-PLAN sas_plan_1
------------------------------
Summary: below is a human-readable, step-by-step trace of the provided plan. Each step lists the action, the concrete parameters, the action preconditions (what must hold to apply it), whether those preconditions are satisfied at the time (and why — from the initial state or produced earlier in the plan), the action effects (what it adds and what it removes), and an estimated timestamp/duration. The steps follow the given plan exactly and in order. Final verification at the end shows that the required goal facts have been achieved.

Timing convention: actions are executed sequentially, each assigned a 1.0 time-unit duration for readability. Start time t = 0.0.

Step 1 — t = 0.0 → 1.0
Action: clip(object_12, object_4, object_6)
- Preconditions (required):
  - (hand object_12)
  - (sneeze object_4)
  - (texture object_6)
  - (next object_4 object_6)
  - (next object_12 object_6)
- Preconditions satisfied? Yes.
  - (hand object_12), (sneeze object_4), (texture object_6), (next object_4 object_6), (next object_12 object_6) are all present in the initial state.
- Effects:
  - Add: (vase object_12 object_4)
  - Delete: (next object_12 object_6)
- Natural-language: Using object_12 (which is a “hand”), with object_4 (a “sneeze”) and texture object_6 while object_4 and object_12 were both linked to object_6, create vase(object_12,object_4) and remove the next link object_12→object_6.

Step 2 — t = 1.0 → 2.0
Action: wretched(object_4, object_8, object_7, object_2)
- Preconditions (required):
  - (sneeze object_4)
  - (texture object_8)
  - (texture object_7)
  - (stupendous object_2)
  - (next object_4 object_8)
  - (collect object_8 object_2)
  - (collect object_7 object_2)
- Preconditions satisfied? Yes.
  - All listed predicates appear in the initial state (collect object_8 object_2 and collect object_7 object_2 are in the combined initial facts; next object_4 object_8 is present).
- Effects:
  - Add: (next object_4 object_7)
  - Delete: (next object_4 object_8)
- Natural-language: Move object_4’s next link from object_8 to object_7 (because object_2 owns the relevant collect relations and object_4 is a sneeze), creating next(object_4,object_7) and removing next(object_4,object_8).

Step 3 — t = 2.0 → 3.0
Action: tightfisted(object_12, object_4, object_7)
- Preconditions (required):
  - (hand object_12)
  - (sneeze object_4)
  - (texture object_7)
  - (next object_4 object_7)
  - (vase object_12 object_4)
- Preconditions satisfied? Yes.
  - (hand object_12), (sneeze object_4), (texture object_7) from initial state.
  - (next object_4 object_7) was added by Step 2.
  - (vase object_12 object_4) was added by Step 1.
- Effects:
  - Add: (next object_12 object_7)
  - Delete: (vase object_12 object_4)
- Natural-language: Use object_12 with object_4 to remove the vase relationship and create next(object_12,object_7). This achieves next object_12→object_7 (one of the goals).

Step 4 — t = 3.0 → 4.0
Action: sip(object_10, object_0, object_8)
- Preconditions (required):
  - (hand object_10)
  - (cats object_0)
  - (texture object_8)
  - (next object_10 object_8)
  - (next object_0 object_8)
- Preconditions satisfied? Yes.
  - All five predicates are present in the initial state.
- Effects:
  - Add: (vase object_10 object_0)
  - Delete: (next object_10 object_8)
- Natural-language: Combine object_10 and object_0 w.r.t. object_8 to create vase(object_10,object_0) and remove the next link object_10→object_8.

Step 5 — t = 4.0 → 5.0
Action: paltry(object_10, object_0, object_7)
- Preconditions (required):
  - (hand object_10)
  - (cats object_0)
  - (texture object_7)
  - (vase object_10 object_0)
  - (next object_0 object_7)
- Preconditions satisfied? Yes.
  - (hand object_10), (cats object_0), (texture object_7), and (next object_0 object_7) come from the initial state (or union).
  - (vase object_10 object_0) was added by Step 4.
- Effects:
  - Add: (next object_10 object_7)
  - Delete: (vase object_10 object_0)
- Natural-language: Using the vase just created for object_10/object_0 and the next link object_0→object_7, create next(object_10,object_7) and remove vase(object_10,object_0). This achieves next object_10→object_7 (another goal).

Step 6 — t = 5.0 → 6.0
Action: memory(object_0, object_8, object_5)
- Preconditions (required):
  - (cats object_0)
  - (spring object_8)
  - (spring object_5)
  - (next object_0 object_8)
- Preconditions satisfied? Yes.
  - (cats object_0), (spring object_8), (spring object_5) are in the initial state.
  - (next object_0 object_8) is present in the initial state and has not been deleted by earlier steps.
- Effects:
  - Add: (next object_0 object_5)
  - Delete: (next object_0 object_8)
- Natural-language: Move object_0’s next link from object_8 to object_5 (creates next(object_0,object_5) and removes next(object_0,object_8)). This is used to enable the next sip/paltry sequence for object_11.

Step 7 — t = 6.0 → 7.0
Action: sip(object_11, object_0, object_5)
- Preconditions (required):
  - (hand object_11)
  - (cats object_0)
  - (texture object_5)
  - (next object_11 object_5)
  - (next object_0 object_5)
- Preconditions satisfied? Yes.
  - (hand object_11) and (cats object_0) are in the initial state.
  - (texture object_5) is in the initial state.
  - (next object_11 object_5) was present in the initial state.
  - (next object_0 object_5) was added by Step 6.
- Effects:
  - Add: (vase object_11 object_0)
  - Delete: (next object_11 object_5)
- Natural-language: Create vase(object_11,object_0) by combining object_11 and object_0 relative to object_5, and remove next(object_11,object_5).

Step 8 — t = 7.0 → 8.0
Action: paltry(object_11, object_0, object_7)
- Preconditions (required):
  - (hand object_11)
  - (cats object_0)
  - (texture object_7)
  - (vase object_11 object_0)
  - (next object_0 object_7)
- Preconditions satisfied? Yes.
  - (hand object_11), (cats object_0), (texture object_7), (next object_0 object_7) are in the initial state or unchanged.
  - (vase object_11 object_0) was added by Step 7.
- Effects:
  - Add: (next object_11 object_7)
  - Delete: (vase object_11 object_0)
- Natural-language: Use the vase for object_11/object_0 together with the existing next(object_0,object_7) to create next(object_11,object_7). This completes the final required next link.

Final state verification (after t = 8.0)
- Achieved goal facts:
  - (next object_10 object_7) was added in Step 5.
  - (next object_11 object_7) was added in Step 8.
  - (next object_12 object_7) was added in Step 3.
- All three required next relations are present. Final goal satisfied.
- Total plan cost (as provided): 8 (unit cost).

Notes / assumptions made (explicit):
- Actions were applied in the exact order from the plan, one at a time.
- Each action’s preconditions and effects are interpreted exactly as given in the domain (STRIPS-style add/delete).
- Each step cites whether preconditions came from the original initial facts or were produced earlier in the plan; no external facts beyond the problem’s init and the plan effects were assumed.

If you want, I can also produce a compact timeline (timestamped summary only), or a minimal checklist that shows which initial facts enabled each step.

================================================================================


FINAL-PLAN
------------------------------
I can produce the integrated FastDownwards-ready PDDL domain and problem files, but I don't have the public information or the two players' local views from your scenario. Please provide those inputs so I can generate a correct and complete encoding.

To make the integration correct and fast, please supply the following for each input source (public info, Player1 view, Player2 view):

1. Types and objects known locally (or globally) — e.g., types like robot, location, package and specific named objects.
2. Local predicates (what each agent can observe or believes) and which predicates are public (shared) vs private (local).
3. Actions available to each agent: name, parameters, preconditions, and effects. If an action is public, say so; if it is private to one agent, say so. If action semantics are described in words (e.g., “move from A to B if adjacent”), give the exact logical preconditions and effects.
4. Initial facts (who believes what initially). If there is uncertainty differing between agents, provide each agent's initial belief set and the public initial facts.
5. Goals to encode:
   - scenario_A goal: explicit logical goal formula (conjunction of predicates or similar).
   - scenario_B goal: explicit logical goal formula.
6. Any hard constraints derived from preferences or natural-language constraints (e.g., “avoid location L1” means forbid states with (at robot L1) — treat as hard constraint).
7. Any domain-level typing relationships or invariants (e.g., adjacency is symmetric).
8. If you want action-costs or numeric resources, state them explicitly (note: you asked to limit :requirements; I can include :action-costs only if you provide matching numeric effects).

If you prefer, paste the public statement and the two local views verbatim (they can be plain English). I will then:
- Resolve naming collisions,
- Make predicates and types consistent,
- Keep separate action names for distinct local perspectives,
- Encode initial state(s) and the two scenario goals,
- Produce one PDDL domain enclosed in <domain></domain> and one or more PDDL problem files enclosed in <problem></problem>, ready for FastDownwards with :requirements limited to :strips, :typing, and :negative-preconditions (and :action-costs only if requested).

If helpful, I can also provide a small illustrative example of the final PDDL format before integrating your real inputs. Which would you prefer: (A) paste the public + both local views now, or (B) see a short example PDDL output first?

Final status (after t = 21)
- The goal facts for scenario_A are satisfied:
  - (next object_10 object_6) — created at t = 17
  - (next object_11 object_7) — created at t = 21
  - (next object_12 object_7) — created at t = 20
  - (next object_9 object_6) — created at t = 16
- Total steps (cost) = 22

Notes:
- Each step is shown with its action-specific preconditions and effects according to the domain definition supplied.
- Timestamps are simple integer steps with an assumed duration of 1 unit per action for readability.

FINAL-PLAN
------------------------------
I don’t have the two analyst outputs or the environment public information referenced in your instruction, so I can’t reliably produce a correct, non‑invented PDDL domain and problem yet.

Please provide the following so I can create a FastDownwards‑compatible PDDL domain and problem that reconcile both analyses:

1. The full textual outputs from analyst_A and analyst_B (their structured analyses of actions, objects, initial facts, goals, constraints, and any naming they used).
2. The environment public information/data that you mentioned (objects, agents, available actions, initial state facts, constraints/preferences treated as hard constraints, and both goal sets).
3. Any required agent‑namespacing convention you prefer (e.g., agentA_, agentB_, or actions prefixed like aA- and aB-). If you have no preference I will prefix agent A’s actions with a_ and agent B’s with b_.
4. Whether temporal ordering constraints such as “earliest” should be encoded as hard ordering constraints (yes/no). Per your note, I will treat them as hard constraints if you confirm.

If you prefer, paste the two analyses and environment data here and I will:
- Reconcile naming mismatches and ambiguous facts,
- Produce a complete PDDL domain and problem using only :strips, :typing, and :negative-preconditions (and :action-costs only if you explicitly want costs),
- Namespace agent actions to keep them distinct,
- Ensure the initial state includes all facts from both analyses, and include both goal sets as conjunctive hard goals.

Once you provide the two analyses and environment info, I’ll generate the <domain>…</domain> and <problem>…</problem> PDDL artifacts for FastDownwards.

- next object_12 object_7 (added step 21)    ← goal element
- next object_13 object_9 (added step 13)    ← goal element

Vase relations remaining at end:
- (none required for the goal; last remaining vases were removed as plan progressed; final vase object_10 object_1 was deleted at step 22)

Goal check:
Requested goal: next object_10 object_6, next object_11 object_9, next object_12 object_7, next object_13 object_9.
Result: ALL PRESENT in final state — GOAL ACHIEVED.

Precondition failures or ambiguities: None. Every step's preconditions were satisfied at the time the action was applied given the initial facts and the intermediate state updates produced by prior actions.

Notes on timing: timestamps are illustrative (10-second spacing) and show the ordered application of actions; the plan is sequential and each step depends on prior state updates as documented above.

  ;; - We therefore assume analyst_A's S0 is authoritative for the intended planning instance.
  ;; - No additional facts were invented; all predicates and actions match the analysts' schemas.
  ;; - If you intended analyst_B's alternative initial facts or goal (next object_11 object_10), please

NATURAL-PLAN sas_plan_1
------------------------------
Summary: I present the 12-step human-readable execution of the provided PDDL plan. Each step shows a timestamp (1 time unit per action, sequential), the action (with object-role mapping), the required preconditions (from the domain), confirmation that the preconditions were satisfied at that moment, and the effects (predicates added and removed). At the end I confirm the final goal is achieved and report total cost.

Timing convention: steps run sequentially, each step duration = 1 time unit. Step n runs from time (n-1) to time n.

Step 1 — time 0.0 → 1.0
- Action: clip(hand=object_11, sneeze=object_5, texture=object_9)
- Schema preconditions: (hand object_11), (sneeze object_5), (texture object_9), (next object_5 object_9), (next object_11 object_9)
- Preconditions satisfied? Yes (all true in initial state).
- Effects:
  - Added: (vase object_11 object_5)
  - Deleted: (next object_11 object_9)
- Notes: object_11’s previous next-to-9 relation is removed and a vase relation with object_5 is created.

Step 2 — time 1.0 → 2.0
- Action: wretched(sneeze=object_5, texture_B=object_9, texture_C=object_8, stupendous=object_3)
- Schema preconditions: (sneeze object_5), (texture object_9), (texture object_8), (stupendous object_3), (next object_5 object_9), (collect object_9 object_3), (collect object_8 object_3)
- Preconditions satisfied? Yes (next object_5 object_9 remained true; collect pairs present).
- Effects:
  - Added: (next object_5 object_8)
  - Deleted: (next object_5 object_9)
- Notes: object_5’s next relation switches from object_9 to object_8.

Step 3 — time 2.0 → 3.0
- Action: tightfisted(hand=object_11, sneeze=object_5, texture=object_8)
- Schema preconditions: (hand object_11), (sneeze object_5), (texture object_8), (next object_5 object_8), (vase object_11 object_5)
- Preconditions satisfied? Yes (vase(11,5) created in Step 1; next(5,8) created in Step 2).
- Effects:
  - Added: (next object_11 object_8)
  - Deleted: (vase object_11 object_5)
- Notes: This step achieves next(object_11, object_8) — one of the goal facts. The temporary vase between 11 and 5 is removed.

Step 4 — time 3.0 → 4.0
- Action: clip(hand=object_10, sneeze=object_4, texture=object_7)
- Schema preconditions: (hand object_10), (sneeze object_4), (texture object_7), (next object_4 object_7), (next object_10 object_7)
- Preconditions satisfied? Yes (both next relations present initially).
- Effects:
  - Added: (vase object_10 object_4)
  - Deleted: (next object_10 object_7)
- Notes: object_10 loses its next-to-7 link and gains a vase relation with object_4.

Step 5 — time 4.0 → 5.0
- Action: sip(hand=object_12, cats=object_1, texture=object_8)
- Schema preconditions: (hand object_12), (cats object_1), (texture object_8), (next object_12 object_8), (next object_1 object_8)
- Preconditions satisfied? Yes (both next relations present initially).
- Effects:
  - Added: (vase object_12 object_1)
  - Deleted: (next object_12 object_8)
- Notes: object_12’s next-to-8 is removed and vase(12,1) is created.

Step 6 — time 5.0 → 6.0
- Action: memory(cats=object_1, spring_Y=object_8, spring_Z=object_6)
- Schema preconditions: (cats object_1), (spring object_8), (spring object_6), (next object_1 object_8)
- Preconditions satisfied? Yes (next(1,8) remained until now).
- Effects:
  - Added: (next object_1 object_6)
  - Deleted: (next object_1 object_8)
- Notes: object_1’s next link moves from object_8 to object_6.

Step 7 — time 6.0 → 7.0
- Action: wretched(sneeze=object_4, texture_B=object_7, texture_C=object_6, stupendous=object_2)
- Schema preconditions: (sneeze object_4), (texture object_7), (texture object_6), (stupendous object_2), (next object_4 object_7), (collect object_7 object_2), (collect object_6 object_2)
- Preconditions satisfied? Yes (next(4,7) still true; collect pairs present).
- Effects:
  - Added: (next object_4 object_6)
  - Deleted: (next object_4 object_7)
- Notes: object_4’s next changes from object_7 to object_6.

Step 8 — time 7.0 → 8.0
- Action: tightfisted(hand=object_10, sneeze=object_4, texture=object_6)
- Schema preconditions: (hand object_10), (sneeze object_4), (texture object_6), (next object_4 object_6), (vase object_10 object_4)
- Preconditions satisfied? Yes (next(4,6) from Step 7; vase(10,4) from Step 4).
- Effects:
  - Added: (next object_10 object_6)
  - Deleted: (vase object_10 object_4)
- Notes: This achieves next(object_10, object_6) — another goal fact. The vase between 10 and 4 is removed.

Step 9 — time 8.0 → 9.0
- Action: paltry(hand=object_12, cats=object_1, texture=object_6)
- Schema preconditions: (hand object_12), (cats object_1), (texture object_6), (vase object_12 object_1), (next object_1 object_6)
- Preconditions satisfied? Yes (vase(12,1) created in Step 5; next(1,6) created in Step 6).
- Effects:
  - Added: (next object_12 object_6)
  - Deleted: (vase object_12 object_1)
- Notes: object_12 gets next-to-6 (temporary), vase(12,1) removed.

Step 10 — time 9.0 → 10.0
- Action: clip(hand=object_12, sneeze=object_4, texture=object_6)
- Schema preconditions: (hand object_12), (sneeze object_4), (texture object_6), (next object_4 object_6), (next object_12 object_6)
- Preconditions satisfied? Yes (next(4,6) still present from Step 7; next(12,6) from Step 9).
- Effects:
  - Added: (vase object_12 object_4)
  - Deleted: (next object_12 object_6)
- Notes: vase(12,4) created; the temporary next(12,6) is removed.

Step 11 — time 10.0 → 11.0
- Action: wretched(sneeze=object_4, texture_B=object_6, texture_C=object_7, stupendous=object_2)
- Schema preconditions: (sneeze object_4), (texture object_6), (texture object_7), (stupendous object_2), (next object_4 object_6), (collect object_6 object_2), (collect object_7 object_2)
- Preconditions satisfied? Yes (next(4,6) still true; collect pairs present).
- Effects:
  - Added: (next object_4 object_7)
  - Deleted: (next object_4 object_6)
- Notes: object_4’s next returns from object_6 back to object_7.

Step 12 — time 11.0 → 12.0
- Action: tightfisted(hand=object_12, sneeze=object_4, texture=object_7)
- Schema preconditions: (hand object_12), (sneeze object_4), (texture object_7), (next object_4 object_7), (vase object_12 object_4)
- Preconditions satisfied? Yes (next(4,7) created in Step 11; vase(12,4) created in Step 10).
- Effects:
  - Added: (next object_12 object_7)
  - Deleted: (vase object_12 object_4)
- Notes: This achieves next(object_12, object_7) — the last required goal fact.

Final state (relevant goal predicates):
- (next object_10 object_6) — added in Step 8
- (next object_11 object_8) — added in Step 3
- (next object_12 object_7) — added in Step 12
- (next object_13 object_9) — remained true from initial state

Goal check: All required goal predicates are present. Goal is achieved at time 12.0.

Other remarks and assumptions:
- I used 1 time unit per action (sequential execution). This matches the sequential plan ordering and the given plan’s cost = 12 (unit cost per action).
- No extra actions were added or removed; I followed the given plan exactly.
- Preconditions were verified against the evolving state after each step; all steps are applicable in the presented order and the effects lead to the goal.
- No unstated predicates or actions were invented.

Total steps: 12
Total time: 12.0 time units
Total cost (unit cost per action): 12

NATURAL-PLAN sas_plan_1
------------------------------
Plan (human-readable, step-by-step). Each line shows: step number, timestamp (t = step index), the action with its object arguments, the required preconditions (noting they are satisfied), the effects applied, and the updated key relations (next, vase). Start state (t = -): next = {(0,8), (11,6), (3,7), (4,8)}; vase = {}. Other unary predicates (hand, cats, sneeze, spring, stupendous, texture, collect) are as given in the problem and are used below.

Step 1 — t=0
Action: wretched object_3 object_7 object_6 object_1
- Preconditions required: sneeze(object_3), texture(object_7), texture(object_6), stupendous(object_1), next(object_3,object_7), collect(object_7,object_1), collect(object_6,object_1)

Goal check (after t=10)
- Goal: next(object_11,object_10)
- Status: achieved (next(object_11,object_10) is present)

Total steps: 11 (cost = 11 unit steps). All preconditions at each step are satisfied given the initial facts and the sequence of effects. The final state contains next(object_11,object_10), so the plan achieves the stated goal.

FINAL-PLAN
------------------------------
I don’t have the structured summaries (facts_actor_a and facts_actor_b) you referred to. I can’t reliably produce the unified PDDL domain + problem without those inputs because I must not invent availability beyond what you provided.

Please provide the two structured summaries (facts_actor_a and facts_actor_b). Useful format (JSON-like or plain list) for each actor:
- objects (with types), e.g. agents: [a1, a2], items: [cup, clip1], locations: [kitchen]
- initial predicates, e.g. (at a1 kitchen), (has a2 coin), (intact clip1), etc.
- definitions or descriptions of each of the six actions as the actor understands them: paltry, sip, clip, wretched, memory, tightfisted — for each action indicate:
  - parameters (which objects involved)
  - preconditions (predicates that must hold)
  - effects (predicates added and removed)
  - any hard temporal or ordering constraints (e.g., cannot do sip before paltry)
  - any exclusivity (mutual exclusion between actors) or resource constraints
- goal facts (what must hold at the end)
- any preferences that should be treated as hard constraints

If you prefer, paste the two structured summaries exactly as you have them. If you want, I can also provide:

NATURAL-PLAN sas_plan_1
------------------------------
Plan execution (timestamps in integer time units; each action duration = 1 time unit). Steps follow the given plan exactly.

Step 1 — t=0, duration=1
Action: wretched(object_4, object_10, object_11, object_3)
- Preconditions checked: sneeze(object_4), texture(object_10), texture(object_11), stupendous(object_3), next(object_4, object_10), collect(object_10, object_3), collect(object_11, object_3).
- Effects: add next(object_4, object_11); delete next(object_4, object_10).
- Notes: Preconditions are satisfied by the union of initial facts. After this step, object_4 now points to object_11 instead of object_10.

Step 2 — t=1, duration=1
Action: wretched(object_4, object_7, object_10, object_2)
- Preconditions checked: sneeze(object_4), texture(object_7), texture(object_10), stupendous(object_2), next(object_4, object_7), collect(object_7, object_2), collect(object_10, object_2).
- Effects: add next(object_4, object_10); delete next(object_4, object_7).
- Notes: This re-establishes next(object_4, object_10) and removes the link from object_4 to object_7.

Step 3 — t=2, duration=1
Action: clip(object_12, object_4, object_10)
- Preconditions checked: hand(object_12), sneeze(object_4), texture(object_10), next(object_4, object_10), next(object_12, object_10).
- Effects: add vase(object_12, object_4); delete next(object_12, object_10).
- Notes: Uses the link next(object_4,object_10) created by Step 2; creates a vase relationship from object_12 to object_4 and removes the link from object_12 to object_10.

Step 4 — t=3, duration=1
Action: tightfisted(object_12, object_4, object_11)
- Preconditions checked: hand(object_12), sneeze(object_4), texture(object_11), next(object_4, object_11), vase(object_12, object_4).
- Effects: add next(object_12, object_11); delete vase(object_12, object_4).
- Notes: This produces next(object_12, object_11), satisfying the second goal component.

Step 5 — t=4, duration=1
Action: memory(object_1, object_9, object_8)
- Preconditions checked: cats(object_1), spring(object_9), spring(object_8), next(object_1, object_9).
- Effects: add next(object_1, object_8); delete next(object_1, object_9).
- Notes: Redirects object_1 from pointing at object_9 to pointing at object_8.

Step 6 — t=5, duration=1
Action: sip(object_11, object_1, object_8)
- Preconditions checked: hand(object_11), cats(object_1), texture(object_8), next(object_11, object_8), next(object_1, object_8).
- Effects: add vase(object_11, object_1); delete next(object_11, object_8).
- Notes: Creates a vase(object_11,object_1) and removes the link next(object_11,object_8).

Step 7 — t=6, duration=1
Action: memory(object_1, object_8, object_9)
- Preconditions checked: cats(object_1), spring(object_8), spring(object_9), next(object_1, object_8).
- Effects: add next(object_1, object_9); delete next(object_1, object_8).
- Notes: Restores the link next(object_1,object_9) (it was deleted in Step 5 and re-added now).

Step 8 — t=7, duration=1
Action: paltry(object_11, object_1, object_9)
- Preconditions checked: hand(object_11), cats(object_1), texture(object_9), vase(object_11, object_1), next(object_1, object_9).
- Effects: add next(object_11, object_9); delete vase(object_11, object_1).
- Notes: Produces next(object_11, object_9), satisfying the first goal component.

Final status after Step 8
- Goal facts achieved: next(object_11, object_9) (from Step 8) and next(object_12, object_11) (from Step 4).
- Plan length / cost: 8 actions (unit cost each), total cost = 8.

This sequence exactly follows the provided plan; at each step the stated preconditions are satisfied by the initial facts plus prior step effects, and the listed effects produce the two required goal facts.

FINAL-PLAN
------------------------------
I don't have the required inputs (analysis_player, analysis_observer, and environment->public_information) in your message. I need those analyses and the public action specifications to produce a correct, FastDownwards-compatible PDDL domain and the two scenario problem files.

Please provide:
- analysis_player: the player's capabilities, actions they can perform, constraints, and goals (as plain text).
- analysis_observer: the observer's capabilities, actions, constraints, and goals (as plain text).
- environment->public_information: the public action specifications (action names, preconditions, effects, any objects/typed domains, and any hard temporal constraints that should be modeled as strict constraints).

If you prefer, paste the three blocks exactly as you have them. If you want me to proceed from a short summary, include:
- a list of agents (with distinct names),
- all action schemas (name, parameters, preconditions, effects),
- object types and initial state facts for both Scenario A and Scenario B,
- goal conditions for Scenario A and Scenario B,
- any strict preferences to encode as hard constraints.

Once you provide those, I'll produce:
- a PDDL domain enclosed in <domain></domain> tags with a brief comment documenting any naming choices,
- two PDDL problem files enclosed in <problem></problem> tags for Scenario A and Scenario B,
all compatible with FastDownwards and using only the allowed :requirements (:strips, :typing, :negative-preconditions).

So pick X = object_0 because next object_0 object_5 exists initially; clip object_12 object_0 object_5 would require sneeze object_0 (missing) and next object_12 object_5 (the very goal) \u2014 so clip is blocked.\n    - Alternative: produce sneeze object_0 (no domain operator produces sneeze predicate in public spec), so that route is blocked by lack of any action that creates sneeze.\n    - Conclusion: obtaining next object_12 object_5 appears blocked given the provided actions and predicates unless one can supply sneeze for object_0 or vase object_12 object_0 by some other means; both are not producible from current facts.\n  Candidate B to get next object_11 object_7:\n    - Use paltry/tightfisted/memory/wretched shape, but all require either cats object_11 or sneeze object_11 or a vase involving object_11 \u2014 none present and none can be produced from current facts.\n- Observer verdict: With the current action set and initial facts for Scenario B, there are no actionable, non-circular sequences that produce the missing predicates (sneeze or cats for the target actors, or the required vase relationships). The scenario is blocked unless additional facts (sneeze(X) or cats(X), or an initial vase(...)) are provided or there exist other domain actions that can generate sneeze/cats/vase without circular preconditions. Candidate actions are identified, but each requires prerequisites that are absent in Scenario B."

NATURAL-PLAN sas_plan_1
------------------------------
Summary: The plan is executed by agent "observer" in four ordered steps. I list each step with a timestamp (1 unit per step), the required preconditions (and whether they held when the step was applied), the add/delete effects, and the resulting local state changes. All four steps are applicable in sequence and the final goal (next object_12 object_11) is achieved.

Initial relevant facts (from Scenario A): 
- hand(object_12), sneeze(object_4), sneeze(object_5), texture(object_10), texture(object_11), texture(object_6), texture(object_7), texture(object_8), texture(object_9),
- next(object_0,object_6), next(object_1,object_9), next(object_12,object_10), next(object_4,object_7), next(object_5,object_9),
- collect(object_10,object_3), collect(object_11,object_3), collect(object_6,object_2), collect(object_7,object_2), collect(object_8,object_2), collect(object_9,object_3),
- stupendous(object_2), stupendous(object_3), cats(object_0), cats(object_1), spring(object_6), spring(object_9).

Step 1 — t = 0 → 1 (duration: 1)
Action: wretched(observer, o0=object_5, o1=object_9, o2=object_10, o3=object_3)

Preconditions (wretched requires):
- (sneeze object_5) — satisfied (present).
- (texture object_9) — satisfied.
- (texture object_10) — satisfied.
- (stupendous object_3) — satisfied.
- (next object_5 object_9) — satisfied.
- (collect object_9 object_3) — satisfied.
- (collect object_10 object_3) — satisfied.

Applicability: All preconditions satisfied → action applicable.

Effects:
- Add: (next object_5 object_10)
- Delete: (next object_5 object_9)

State change after Step 1:
- next(object_5,object_10) is now true.
- next(object_5,object_9) is removed.

Step 2 — t = 1 → 2 (duration: 1)
Action: clip(observer, o0=object_12, o1=object_5, o2=object_10)

Preconditions (clip requires):
- (hand object_12) — satisfied.
- (sneeze object_5) — satisfied.
- (texture object_10) — satisfied.
- (next object_5 object_10) — satisfied (created by Step 1).
- (next object_12 object_10) — satisfied (initial fact).

Applicability: All preconditions satisfied → action applicable.

Effects:
- Add: (vase object_12 object_5)
- Delete: (next object_12 object_10)

State change after Step 2:
- vase(object_12,object_5) is now true.
- next(object_12,object_10) is removed.

Step 3 — t = 2 → 3 (duration: 1)
Action: wretched(observer, o0=object_5, o1=object_10, o2=object_11, o3=object_3)

Preconditions (wretched requires):
- (sneeze object_5) — satisfied.
- (texture object_10) — satisfied.
- (texture object_11) — satisfied.
- (stupendous object_3) — satisfied.
- (next object_5 object_10) — satisfied (created by Step 1 and still present until now).
- (collect object_10 object_3) — satisfied (initial fact).
- (collect object_11 object_3) — satisfied (initial fact).

Applicability: All preconditions satisfied → action applicable.

Effects:
- Add: (next object_5 object_11)
- Delete: (next object_5 object_10)

State change after Step 3:
- next(object_5,object_11) is now true.
- next(object_5,object_10) is removed.

Step 4 — t = 3 → 4 (duration: 1)
Action: tightfisted(observer, o0=object_12, o1=object_5, o2=object_11)

Preconditions (tightfisted requires):
- (hand object_12) — satisfied.
- (sneeze object_5) — satisfied.
- (texture object_11) — satisfied.
- (next object_5 object_11) — satisfied (created by Step 3).
- (vase object_12 object_5) — satisfied (created by Step 2).

Applicability: All preconditions satisfied → action applicable.

Effects:
- Add: (next object_12 object_11)
- Delete: (vase object_12 object_5)

State change after Step 4:
- next(object_12,object_11) is now true (goal achieved).
- vase(object_12,object_5) is removed.

Final check:
- Goal (next object_12 object_11) is true after Step 4. The plan of four steps executed by observer is valid and achieves the goal.

<domain>
; Domain: orchestrator_domain
; Notes / assumptions:
; - Predicates 'hand', 'cats', 'texture', 'vase', 'sneeze', 'stupendous', 'spring' are unary as supplied.
; - Predicate 'next' is binary (ordering/adjacency).
; - The state supplied by state_keeper contains collect facts with two arguments (e.g. collect(object_10, object_2)).
;   To remain consistent with the provided state, this domain models collect as a binary predicate collect ?x ?y.
;   Where the player model originally used collect as unary, actions that reference collect now include an additional
;   parameter to match the binary arity and require collect ?x ?partner as a precondition.
; - Each action toggles at least one next(...) relation and at least one vase(...) relation as described in the player model.
; - All objects share the single type "object".
; - Only :strips and :typing requirements are declared (no advanced ADL features are used).

NATURAL-PLAN sas_plan_7
------------------------------
Below is a clear, step-by-step human-readable execution of the provided plan. I list each action in order, assign a timestamp (one time unit per action), state the minimal preconditions that must hold when the action is applied, and state the direct effects (what is added and what is removed). Timestamps are integers starting at t=0; each action has duration = 1 time unit.

Effects (applied at t=18): add next(object_11,object_7); delete vase(object_11,object_3).

Plan complete at t=18.

Final relevant facts (after last action):
- next(object_11,object_7) — added at Step 18 (goal met).
- next(object_12,object_5) — added at Step 14 (goal met).
(Other next and vase relations were created and removed along the way as described in each step.)

This listing matches the plan exactly (18 actions), shows when each action occurs, and reports the preconditions and effects for each step.

  ; Assumptions and notes:
  ; - Observations from observer_A and observer_B have been merged by union.
  ;   Where observers disagreed about which ground facts hold, both facts are
  ;   included if provided by at least one observer. This is a merging choice
  ;   (union) because no explicit conflict resolution rule was provided.
  ; - Action schemas have been kept distinct per observer by prefixing with
  ;   observer_A_ or observer_B_. The schemas are otherwise replicated as
  ;   reported by each observer to preserve provenance of capabilities.
  ; - No additional predicates, objects, or actions were invented beyond the
  ;   two observer reports. Preferences were treated as hard constraints and
  ;   encoded as normal preconditions/effects where present in observers'
  ;   descriptions.
  ; - If the merged initial state still leaves the listed goals unreachable by
  ;   the provided actions, that is a property of the original reports; the
  ;   domain/problem below is faithful to the inputs.

  ; Assumptions and notes:
  ; - Observations from observer_A and observer_B have been merged by union.
  ;   Where observers disagreed about which ground facts hold, both facts are
  ;   included if provided by at least one observer. This is a merging choice
  ;   (union) because no explicit conflict resolution rule was provided.
  ; - Action schemas have been kept distinct per observer by prefixing with
  ;   observer_A_ or observer_B_. The schemas are otherwise replicated as
  ;   reported by each observer to preserve provenance of capabilities.
  ; - No additional predicates, objects, or actions were invented beyond the
  ;   two observer reports. Preferences were treated as hard constraints and
  ;   encoded as normal preconditions/effects where present in observers'
  ;   descriptions.
  ; - If the merged initial state still leaves the listed goals unreachable by
  ;   the provided actions, that is a property of the original reports; the
  ;   domain/problem below is faithful to the inputs.

NATURAL-PLAN sas_plan_1
------------------------------
Plan (7 steps, each step duration ≈ 1s; total cost = 7)

Step 1 — t = 0s → 1s
Action: observer_a_clip(object_12, object_4, object_10)
- Preconditions (satisfied): hand(object_12), sneeze(object_4), texture(object_10), next(object_4, object_10), next(object_12, object_10)
- Effects: add vase(object_12, object_4); remove next(object_12, object_10)

Step 2 — t = 1s → 2s
Action: observer_a_wretched(object_4, object_10, object_8, object_2)
- Preconditions (satisfied): sneeze(object_4), texture(object_10), texture(object_8), stupendous(object_2), next(object_4, object_10), collect(object_10, object_2), collect(object_8, object_2)
- Effects: add next(object_4, object_8); remove next(object_4, object_10)

Step 3 — t = 2s → 3s
Action: observer_a_tightfisted(object_12, object_4, object_8)
- Preconditions (satisfied): hand(object_12), sneeze(object_4), texture(object_8), next(object_4, object_8), vase(object_12, object_4)
- Effects: add next(object_12, object_8); remove vase(object_12, object_4)
- Note: This produces next(object_12, object_8) — one half of the final goal.

Step 4 — t = 3s → 4s
Action: observer_a_wretched(object_3, object_7, object_6, object_1)
- Preconditions (satisfied): sneeze(object_3), texture(object_7), texture(object_6), stupendous(object_1), next(object_3, object_7), collect(object_7, object_1), collect(object_6, object_1)
- Effects: add next(object_3, object_6); remove next(object_3, object_7)

Step 5 — t = 4s → 5s
Action: observer_a_clip(object_11, object_3, object_6)
- Preconditions (satisfied): hand(object_11), sneeze(object_3), texture(object_6), next(object_3, object_6), next(object_11, object_6)
- Effects: add vase(object_11, object_3); remove next(object_11, object_6)

Step 6 — t = 5s → 6s
Action: observer_a_wretched(object_3, object_6, object_7, object_1)
- Preconditions (satisfied): sneeze(object_3), texture(object_6), texture(object_7), stupendous(object_1), next(object_3, object_6), collect(object_6, object_1), collect(object_7, object_1)
- Effects: add next(object_3, object_7); remove next(object_3, object_6)

Step 7 — t = 6s → 7s
Action: observer_a_tightfisted(object_11, object_3, object_7)
- Preconditions (satisfied): hand(object_11), sneeze(object_3), texture(object_7), next(object_3, object_7), vase(object_11, object_3)
- Effects: add next(object_11, object_7); remove vase(object_11, object_3)
- Note: This produces next(object_11, object_7) — the other half of the final goal.

Result after step 7
- Achieved goals: next(object_11, object_7) and next(object_12, object_8)
- Total steps: 7, total estimated time ≈ 7s, total cost = 7

All steps match the provided plan exactly; each action’s preconditions were satisfied at the time it was applied and the stated effects produce the required final predicates.

NATURAL-PLAN sas_plan_4
------------------------------
Summary: the following 12-step sequence exactly matches the provided plan. Each step shows a timestamp (start time), an estimated duration, the action with its parameters, the required preconditions (checked against the current state), and the deterministic effects (what is added and what is removed). The state is updated cumulatively after each step. At the end I confirm the two goal predicates are satisfied.

Assume start time 00:00:00. Each step duration ≈ 10s (uniform estimate) unless noted.

- Delete: (next object_0 object_6)

Step 12 — 00:01:50 (duration 00:00:10)
Action: paltry object_13 object_0 object_9
Preconditions checked:
- (hand object_13) — true
- (cats object_0) — true
- (texture object_9) — true
- (vase object_13 object_0) — true (added in Step 10)
- (next object_0 object_9) — true (added in Step 11)
Effects (applied):
