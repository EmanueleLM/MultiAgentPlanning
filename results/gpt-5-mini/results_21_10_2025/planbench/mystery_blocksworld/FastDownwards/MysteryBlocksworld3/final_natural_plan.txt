Plan summary: 9 steps, each step = 1 time unit. Start time t=0, steps run sequentially. Total cost = 9 units.

Step 0 (t = 0 → 1), action: sip object_8 object_1 object_6
- Meaning: perform "sip" with actor/hand object_8, target cats object_1, using texture object_6.
- Preconditions checked (satisfied at t=0): hand(object_8), cats(object_1), texture(object_6), next(object_8, object_6), next(object_1, object_6).
- Effects (applied at t=1): add vase(object_8, object_1); remove next(object_8, object_6).

Step 1 (t = 1 → 2), action: sip object_7 object_1 object_6
- Meaning: perform "sip" with hand object_7, cats object_1, texture object_6.
- Preconditions checked (satisfied at t=1): hand(object_7), cats(object_1), texture(object_6), next(object_7, object_6), next(object_1, object_6).
- Effects (applied at t=2): add vase(object_7, object_1); remove next(object_7, object_6).

Step 2 (t = 2 → 3), action: memory object_1 object_6 object_5
- Meaning: perform "memory" for cats object_1, springs object_6→object_5.
- Preconditions checked (satisfied at t=2): cats(object_1), spring(object_6), spring(object_5), next(object_1, object_6).
- Effects (applied at t=3): add next(object_1, object_5); remove next(object_1, object_6).

Step 3 (t = 3 → 4), action: paltry object_8 object_1 object_5
- Meaning: perform "paltry" with hand object_8, cats object_1, texture object_5 to link object_8 → object_5.
- Preconditions checked (satisfied at t=3): hand(object_8), cats(object_1), texture(object_5), vase(object_8, object_1), next(object_1, object_5).
- Effects (applied at t=4): add next(object_8, object_5); remove vase(object_8, object_1).

Step 4 (t = 4 → 5), action: paltry object_7 object_1 object_5
- Meaning: perform "paltry" with hand object_7, cats object_1, texture object_5 to link object_7 → object_5.
- Preconditions checked (satisfied at t=4): hand(object_7), cats(object_1), texture(object_5), vase(object_7, object_1), next(object_1, object_5).
- Effects (applied at t=5): add next(object_7, object_5); remove vase(object_7, object_1).

Step 5 (t = 5 → 6), action: memory object_0 object_6 object_7
- Meaning: perform "memory" for cats object_0, springs object_6→object_7.
- Preconditions checked (satisfied at t=5): cats(object_0), spring(object_6), spring(object_7), next(object_0, object_6).
- Effects (applied at t=6): add next(object_0, object_7); remove next(object_0, object_6).

Step 6 (t = 6 → 7), action: sip object_9 object_0 object_7
- Meaning: perform "sip" with hand object_9, cats object_0, texture object_7.
- Preconditions checked (satisfied at t=6): hand(object_9), cats(object_0), texture(object_7), next(object_9, object_7), next(object_0, object_7).
- Effects (applied at t=7): add vase(object_9, object_0); remove next(object_9, object_7).

Step 7 (t = 7 → 8), action: memory object_0 object_7 object_6
- Meaning: perform "memory" for cats object_0, springs object_7→object_6.
- Preconditions checked (satisfied at t=7): cats(object_0), spring(object_7), spring(object_6), next(object_0, object_7).
- Effects (applied at t=8): add next(object_0, object_6); remove next(object_0, object_7).

Step 8 (t = 8 → 9), action: paltry object_9 object_0 object_6
- Meaning: perform "paltry" with hand object_9, cats object_0, texture object_6 to link object_9 → object_6.
- Preconditions checked (satisfied at t=8): hand(object_9), cats(object_0), texture(object_6), vase(object_9, object_0), next(object_0, object_6).
- Effects (applied at t=9): add next(object_9, object_6); remove vase(object_9, object_0).

Final state (at t = 9): the requested goal predicates are true
- next(object_7, object_5) — achieved at Step 4
- next(object_8, object_5) — achieved at Step 3
- next(object_8, object_7) — was true initially and remained true
- next(object_9, object_6) — achieved at Step 8

Total plan cost: 9 (unit cost per step).
