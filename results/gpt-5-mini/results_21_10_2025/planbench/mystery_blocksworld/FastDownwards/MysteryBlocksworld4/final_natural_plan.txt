Summary: execute the given 4-step plan exactly as provided. Each step lists a timestamp/duration (illustrative), the action taken, the preconditions and whether they are satisfied at that moment, the action effects, and the resulting key state changes. At the end I verify the goal (next object_8 object_7 AND next object_9 object_6) is satisfied.

Initial relevant facts (from the problem):
- cats: object_0, object_1
- hand: object_8, object_9
- spring: object_6, object_7
- texture: object_6, object_7
- next: object_0→object_6, object_1→object_6, object_4→object_6, object_5→object_7, object_8→object_7, object_9→object_7
- collect: object_6→object_2, object_7→object_3
- sneeze: object_4, object_5
- stupendous: object_2, object_3
- (No vase facts initially.)

Step 1 — t = 0 s, duration ≈ 1 s
Action: memory(object_1, object_6, object_7)

- Preconditions required by memory(x,y,z): (cats x), (spring y), (spring z), (next x y)
  - cats object_1 — TRUE (initial)
  - spring object_6 — TRUE (initial)
  - spring object_7 — TRUE (initial)
  - next object_1 object_6 — TRUE (initial)
- All preconditions satisfied → action is applicable.

- Effects of memory: add (next object_1 object_7); delete (next object_1 object_6).
- State changes produced:
  - next object_1 object_7 becomes TRUE.
  - next object_1 object_6 becomes FALSE.
- Key next facts after step 1 (relevant subset):
  - next object_1→object_7 (new)
  - next object_9→object_7 (unchanged)
  - next object_8→object_7 (unchanged)

Step 2 — t = 1 s, duration ≈ 1 s
Action: sip(object_9, object_1, object_7)

- Preconditions required by sip(x,y,z): (hand x), (cats y), (texture z), (next x z), (next y z)
  - hand object_9 — TRUE (initial)
  - cats object_1 — TRUE (initial)
  - texture object_7 — TRUE (initial)
  - next object_9 object_7 — TRUE (initial)
  - next object_1 object_7 — TRUE (established by Step 1)
- All preconditions satisfied → action is applicable.

- Effects of sip: add (vase object_9 object_1); delete (next object_9 object_7).
- State changes produced:
  - vase object_9 object_1 becomes TRUE.
  - next object_9 object_7 becomes FALSE (removed).
- Key next facts after step 2:
  - next object_1→object_7 (still TRUE)
  - next object_9→object_7 (now FALSE)
  - next object_8→object_7 (still TRUE)

Step 3 — t = 2 s, duration ≈ 1 s
Action: memory(object_1, object_7, object_6)

- Preconditions required by memory(x,y,z): (cats x), (spring y), (spring z), (next x y)
  - cats object_1 — TRUE
  - spring object_7 — TRUE
  - spring object_6 — TRUE
  - next object_1 object_7 — TRUE (from Step 1, unchanged by Step 2)
- All preconditions satisfied → action is applicable.

- Effects of memory: add (next object_1 object_6); delete (next object_1 object_7).
- State changes produced:
  - next object_1 object_6 becomes TRUE (restored).
  - next object_1 object_7 becomes FALSE (removed).
- Key next facts after step 3:
  - next object_1→object_6 (TRUE)
  - next object_9→object_7 (FALSE)
  - next object_8→object_7 (TRUE)

Step 4 — t = 3 s, duration ≈ 1 s
Action: paltry(object_9, object_1, object_6)

- Preconditions required by paltry(x,y,z): (hand x), (cats y), (texture z), (vase x y), (next y z)
  - hand object_9 — TRUE
  - cats object_1 — TRUE
  - texture object_6 — TRUE
  - vase object_9 object_1 — TRUE (created in Step 2)
  - next object_1 object_6 — TRUE (created in Step 3)
- All preconditions satisfied → action is applicable.

- Effects of paltry: add (next object_9 object_6); delete (vase object_9 object_1).
- State changes produced:
  - next object_9 object_6 becomes TRUE.
  - vase object_9 object_1 becomes FALSE (removed).

Final relevant facts after Step 4:
- next object_8 object_7 — TRUE (never removed; was true initially)
- next object_9 object_6 — TRUE (created in Step 4)
- Other next facts: next object_1 object_6 — TRUE (from Step 3); next object_1 object_7 — FALSE; next object_9 object_7 — FALSE.

Goal verification:
- Goal requires: (next object_8 object_7) AND (next object_9 object_6).
  - next object_8 object_7 — TRUE (initial and remained unchanged)
  - next object_9 object_6 — TRUE (established in Step 4)
- Both required facts are TRUE → the goal is satisfied.

Notes and assumptions:
- Timestamps/durations above are illustrative and only to satisfy the request to report time; they do not affect logical applicability.
- No missing facts or ambiguities prevented applying each action in turn; every action's preconditions were present when the action was executed.
- The action sequence is exactly the provided plan and is valid under the domain semantics; it reaches the stated goal.
