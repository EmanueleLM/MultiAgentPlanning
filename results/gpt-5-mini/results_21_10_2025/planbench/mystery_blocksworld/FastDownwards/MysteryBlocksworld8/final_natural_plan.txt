Planned execution (matches the provided plan exactly — 2 actions, unit cost):

Start time: t = 0.0s

1) t = 0.0s — Action: sip(object_9, object_0, object_5) — duration: 1.0s (estimated)
   - Meaning (human): Use object_9 (in hand) with object_0 (cats) at texture object_5 to perform the "sip" action.
   - Preconditions checked before executing:
     - hand object_9 (true)
     - cats object_0 (true)
     - texture object_5 (true)
     - next object_9 object_5 (true)
     - next object_0 object_5 (true)
   - Effects applied by this step:
     - Added: vase object_9 object_0
     - Removed: next object_9 object_5
   - Resulting notable facts after step 1:
     - vase(object_9, object_0) is now true
     - next(object_9, object_5) is no longer true

2) t = 1.0s — Action: paltry(object_9, object_0, object_7) — duration: 1.0s (estimated)
   - Meaning (human): With object_9 in hand and object_0 as the cats object, using texture object_7, perform the "paltry" action to move the relation from object_0→object_7 to object_9→object_7.
   - Preconditions checked before executing:
     - hand object_9 (true)
     - cats object_0 (true)
     - texture object_7 (true)
     - vase object_9 object_0 (true — created by step 1)
     - next object_0 object_7 (true)
   - Effects applied by this step:
     - Added: next object_9 object_7
     - Removed: vase object_9 object_0
   - Resulting notable facts after step 2:
     - next(object_9, object_7) is now true
     - vase(object_9, object_0) is no longer true

End time: t = 2.0s

Final check against the goal:
- next object_10 object_5 — true (present in the initial state and unchanged by the plan)
- next object_9 object_7 — true (established by step 2)

Goal achieved: both required next relations hold.
