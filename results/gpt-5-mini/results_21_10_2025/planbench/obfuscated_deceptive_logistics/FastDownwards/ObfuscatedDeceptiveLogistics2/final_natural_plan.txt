Plan summary (cost = 0):
- Number of actions: 0
- Execution time: t = 0.0s — no actions executed; plan is empty.

Reasoning / step-by-step:
1) (t = 0.0s) No action — initial state already satisfies the goal. No preconditions to check and no effects to apply.

Relevant facts from the initial state (confirmed true):
- next object_7 object_6
- next object_8 object_6

Final state (after executing the empty plan):
- Same as the initial state; the goal (next object_7 object_6 and next object_8 object_6) is achieved.
