Plan (3 steps, unit cost = 3). Each step corresponds exactly to one action in the supplied plan.

1) Time 0s — Action: set-next object_12 object_11
   - What it does: Add the relation next(object_12, object_11).
   - Preconditions checked: next(object_12, object_11) must not already hold (verified in the initial state).
   - Duration: instantaneous (treated as 1 unit / 0s logical step).
   - Resulting effect: next object_12 object_11 is now true.

2) Time 1s — Action: set-next object_12 object_5
   - What it does: Add the relation next(object_12, object_5).
   - Preconditions checked: next(object_12, object_5) must not already hold (verified before this step).
   - Duration: instantaneous (treated as 1 unit / 0s logical step).
   - Resulting effect: next object_12 object_5 is now true.

3) Time 2s — Action: set-next object_11 object_7
   - What it does: Add the relation next(object_11, object_7).
   - Preconditions checked: next(object_11, object_7) must not already hold (verified before this step).
   - Duration: instantaneous (treated as 1 unit / 0s logical step).
   - Resulting effect: next object_11 object_7 is now true.

Final state (after step 3): the goals are satisfied — next object_12 object_11, next object_11 object_7, and next object_12 object_5 all hold. Total plan cost = 3.
