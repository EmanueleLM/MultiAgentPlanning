Plan execution (timestamps in integer time units, each action duration = 1 time unit). All preconditions are satisfied when each action is executed.

t=0 → t=1
1) wretched(object_3, object_5, object_6, object_1)
   - Preconditions checked: sneeze(object_3), texture(object_5), texture(object_6), stupendous(object_1), next(object_3,object_5), collect(object_5,object_1), collect(object_6,object_1).
   - Effects: add next(object_3,object_6); remove next(object_3,object_5).

t=1 → t=2
2) clip(object_9, object_3, object_6)
   - Preconditions checked: hand(object_9), sneeze(object_3), texture(object_6), next(object_3,object_6), next(object_9,object_6).
   - Effects: add vase(object_9,object_3); remove next(object_9,object_6).

t=2 → t=3
3) wretched(object_3, object_6, object_5, object_1)
   - Preconditions checked: sneeze(object_3), texture(object_6), texture(object_5), stupendous(object_1), next(object_3,object_6), collect(object_6,object_1), collect(object_5,object_1).
   - Effects: add next(object_3,object_5); remove next(object_3,object_6).

t=3 → t=4
4) tightfisted(object_9, object_3, object_5)
   - Preconditions checked: hand(object_9), sneeze(object_3), texture(object_5), next(object_3,object_5), vase(object_9,object_3).
   - Effects: add next(object_9,object_5); remove vase(object_9,object_3).

t=4 → t=5
5) sip(object_9, object_0, object_5)
   - Preconditions checked: hand(object_9), cats(object_0), texture(object_5), next(object_9,object_5), next(object_0,object_5).
   - Effects: add vase(object_9,object_0); remove next(object_9,object_5).

t=5 → t=6
6) memory(object_0, object_5, object_7)
   - Preconditions checked: cats(object_0), spring(object_5), spring(object_7), next(object_0,object_5).
   - Effects: add next(object_0,object_7); remove next(object_0,object_5).

t=6 → t=7
7) paltry(object_9, object_0, object_7)
   - Preconditions checked: hand(object_9), cats(object_0), texture(object_7), vase(object_9,object_0), next(object_0,object_7).
   - Effects: add next(object_9,object_7); remove vase(object_9,object_0).

Final state (after t=7):
- The goal fact next(object_9, object_7) is true.
- All intermediate preconditions were present at their execution times; plan cost = 7 actions (unit cost).
