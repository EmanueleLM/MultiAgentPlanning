Step 1 — [timestamp: t=0.0s → t=1.0s; duration ≈ 1s]
- Action: mover_alpha performs pickup(C) from the table.
- Preconditions checked: C was on the table (ontable(C)), C was clear, mover_alpha was handempty, nobody was holding anything, and the plan was at step s0.
- Effects/resulting state after the step:
  - mover_alpha is holding C (holding(mover_alpha, C)).
  - C is no longer on the table (not ontable(C)).
  - mover_alpha is no longer handempty.
  - There is no longer "nobody-holding".
  - The plan's current step advances from s0 to s10 (current = s10).
