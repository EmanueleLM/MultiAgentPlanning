Summary: executing the provided plan (4 actions) in order. Each step lists a timestamp, duration, the exact action (matching the PDDL plan), the performing agent, the preconditions that held, and the resulting state changes for the affected blocks and agents. All actions follow standard BlocksWorld rules (only top blocks moved; one block held per agent).

Initial relevant state (before step 1)
- Stacks: A on B, B on E, E on C, C on D. D, F, G on table.
- Clear: A, F, G.
- Hands empty: agent1, agent2, orchestrator.

Step 1
- Time: 2025-10-21T09:00:00.000Z
- Duration: 5 s
- Action: unstack agent1 A B
- Agent: agent1
- Preconditions checked and satisfied: agent1 handempty; A is on B; A is clear.
- Effects / state after step:
  - agent1 is holding A.
  - A is no longer on B and is not on the table.
  - A is no longer clear (it is held).
  - B becomes clear (top removed).
  - Hands: agent1 = holding(A); agent2 = handempty; orchestrator = handempty.
  - Current stacks/positions (partial): B on E, E on C, C on D; D, F, G on table; A held by agent1.

Step 2
- Time: 2025-10-21T09:00:05.000Z
- Duration: 4 s
- Action: pickup orchestrator G
- Agent: orchestrator
- Preconditions checked and satisfied: orchestrator handempty; G is on the table; G is clear.
- Effects / state after step:
  - orchestrator is holding G.
  - G is no longer on the table and is not clear (it is held).
  - Hands: agent1 = holding(A); orchestrator = holding(G); agent2 = handempty.
  - Current stacks/positions (partial): A held by agent1; B on E; E on C; C on D; D, F on table; G held by orchestrator.

Step 3
- Time: 2025-10-21T09:00:09.000Z
- Duration: 4 s
- Action: stack orchestrator G F
- Agent: orchestrator
- Preconditions checked and satisfied: orchestrator is holding G; F is clear.
- Effects / state after step:
  - G is placed on F (on G F).
  - G becomes clear.
  - F is no longer clear.
  - orchestrator becomes handempty (no longer holding G).
  - Hands: agent1 = holding(A); orchestrator = handempty; agent2 = handempty.
  - Current stacks/positions (partial): A held by agent1; B on E; E on C; C on D; D, F on table; G on F.

Step 4
- Time: 2025-10-21T09:00:13.000Z
- Duration: 3 s
- Action: putdown agent1 A
- Agent: agent1
- Preconditions checked and satisfied: agent1 is holding A.
- Effects / state after step:
  - A is put down on the table (ontable A).
  - A becomes clear.
  - agent1 becomes handempty (no longer holding A).
  - Hands: agent1 = handempty; orchestrator = handempty; agent2 = handempty.
  - Current stacks/positions (final): A on table; B on E; E on C; C on D; D on table; F on table; G on F.

Final arrangement (after executing all plan steps)
- A is on the table.
- B is on E.
- E is on C.
- C is on D.
- D is on the table.
- F is on the table.
- G is on F.

This final arrangement matches the specified goal and the expected_final_arrangement. Total reported execution time (sum of durations): 16 s.
