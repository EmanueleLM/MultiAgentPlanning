Below is a clear, step-by-step human-readable execution of the provided plan. Each step lists the agent, the action, the objects involved, a short description of the state change (what was picked up / put down / which block becomes clear), and a simple timestamp assuming 10 seconds per action (start t=00:00:00). The sequence matches the plan exactly (no actions added or removed).

Step 1 — t=00:00:00 → 00:00:10
Agent: mover_beta
Action: unstack H from J
Effect: mover_beta picks up H from the top of J. H is now held by mover_beta; J becomes clear (no block on top).

Step 2 — t=00:00:10 → 00:00:20
Agent: mover_beta
Action: stack H onto I
Effect: mover_beta places H onto I. H is now on I; mover_beta's hand is free; I is no longer clear (H on top).

Step 3 — t=00:00:20 → 00:00:30
Agent: mover_beta
Action: unstack J from A
Effect: mover_beta picks up J from the top of A. J is now held by mover_beta; A becomes clear.

Step 4 — t=00:00:30 → 00:00:40
Agent: mover_beta
Action: stack J onto E
Effect: mover_beta places J onto E. J is now on E; mover_beta's hand is free; E is no longer clear (J on top).

Step 5 — t=00:00:40 → 00:00:50
Agent: mover_alpha
Action: unstack A from F
Effect: mover_alpha picks up A from the top of F. A is now held by mover_alpha; F becomes clear.

Step 6 — t=00:00:50 → 00:01:00
Agent: mover_alpha
Action: putdown A (onto table)
Effect: mover_alpha places A down on the table. A is now on the table and clear; mover_alpha's hand is free.

Step 7 — t=00:01:00 → 00:01:10
Agent: mover_alpha
Action: pickup A (from table)
Effect: mover_alpha picks up A from the table. A is now held by mover_alpha (not on the table).

Step 8 — t=00:01:10 → 00:01:20
Agent: mover_alpha
Action: stack A onto H
Effect: mover_alpha places A onto H. A is now on H; mover_alpha's hand is free; H is no longer clear.

Step 9 — t=00:01:20 → 00:01:30
Agent: mover_beta
Action: unstack J from E
Effect: mover_beta picks up J from the top of E. J is now held by mover_beta; E becomes clear.

Step 10 — t=00:01:30 → 00:01:40
Agent: mover_beta
Action: putdown J (onto table)
Effect: mover_beta places J down on the table. J is now on the table and clear; mover_beta's hand is free.

Step 11 — t=00:01:40 → 00:01:50
Agent: mover_beta
Action: pickup F (from table)
Effect: mover_beta picks up F from the table. F is now held by mover_beta (not on the table).

Step 12 — t=00:01:50 → 00:02:00
Agent: mover_beta
Action: stack F onto A
Effect: mover_beta places F onto A. F is now on A; mover_beta's hand is free; A is no longer clear.

Step 13 — t=00:02:00 → 00:02:10
Agent: mover_beta
Action: unstack F from A
Effect: mover_beta picks up F from the top of A. F is now held by mover_beta; A becomes clear.

Step 14 — t=00:02:10 → 00:02:20
Agent: mover_beta
Action: stack F onto A
Effect: mover_beta places F back onto A. F is now on A again; mover_beta's hand is free; A is no longer clear.

Step 15 — t=00:02:20 → 00:02:30
Agent: mover_beta
Action: pickup J (from table)
Effect: mover_beta picks up J from the table. J is now held by mover_beta (not on the table).

Step 16 — t=00:02:30 → 00:02:40
Agent: mover_beta
Action: putdown J (onto table)
Effect: mover_beta places J down on the table. J is now on the table and clear; mover_beta's hand is free.

Step 17 — t=00:02:40 → 00:02:50
Agent: mover_beta
Action: pickup J (from table)
Effect: mover_beta picks up J again. J is now held by mover_beta.

Step 18 — t=00:02:50 → 00:03:00
Agent: mover_beta
Action: putdown J (onto table)
Effect: mover_beta places J down on the table again. J is on the table and clear; mover_beta's hand is free.

Step 19 — t=00:03:00 → 00:03:10
Agent: mover_alpha
Action: unstack E from C
Effect: mover_alpha picks up E from the top of C. E is now held by mover_alpha; C becomes clear.

Step 20 — t=00:03:10 → 00:03:20
Agent: mover_alpha
Action: stack E onto J
Effect: mover_alpha places E onto J. E is now on J; mover_alpha's hand is free; J is no longer clear.

Final arrangement (for verification) — each block: "on table" or "on <block>"

- A: on H
- B: on table
- C: on G
- D: on B
- E: on J
- F: on A
- G: on table
- H: on I
- I: on D
- J: on table

Notes:
- The timestamps are illustrative, using a fixed 10-second duration per action to provide a simple timeline; the plan sequence and effects are identical to the provided PDDL plan.
- The final arrangement above is derived by simulating the exact action sequence given; it lists where every block ends up (on table or on another block).
