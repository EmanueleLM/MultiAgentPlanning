Sequence of actions (followed exactly as in the plan). Each entry gives: step number, agent, action (with logical step sX->sY), timestamp (assume 1.0s per action for clarity), and a one-sentence legality justification.

Assumed timing: action n runs from t=(n-1).0s to t=n.0s.

1) Agent: manipulator_1 — (unstack h a) (s0 -> s1) [t=0.0–1.0s]
   Legal because: H was on A, H was clear (top of that stack), and the hand was empty.

2) Agent: manipulator_1 — (stack h b) (s1 -> s2) [t=1.0–2.0s]
   Legal because: H was being held and B was clear, so placing H onto B satisfies the stack preconditions.

3) Agent: manipulator_1 — (unstack i f) (s2 -> s3) [t=2.0–3.0s]
   Legal because: I was on F and clear, and the hand was empty, so I could be unstacked from F.

4) Agent: manipulator_1 — (stack i a) (s3 -> s4) [t=3.0–4.0s]
   Legal because: I was being held and A was clear (A had become clear after H was removed), so stacking I on A is allowed.

5) Agent: manipulator_1 — (unstack i a) (s4 -> s5) [t=4.0–5.0s]
   Legal because: I was on A and clear (top), and the hand was empty, so I could be unstacked from A.

6) Agent: manipulator_1 — (stack i h) (s5 -> s6) [t=5.0–6.0s]
   Legal because: I was being held and H was clear (H was on B and free), permitting stacking I onto H.

7) Agent: manipulator_1 — (unstack a c) (s6 -> s7) [t=6.0–7.0s]
   Legal because: A was on C and A was clear (I had been moved off A), and the hand was empty, so A could be unstacked from C.

8) Agent: manipulator_1 — (putdown a) (s7 -> s8) [t=7.0–8.0s]
   Legal because: A was being held and putdown requires holding the block (result: A placed on the table).

9) Agent: manipulator_1 — (pickup a) (s8 -> s9) [t=8.0–9.0s]
   Legal because: A was on the table, clear, and the hand was empty, so A could be picked up.

10) Agent: manipulator_1 — (stack a i) (s9 -> s10) [t=9.0–10.0s]
    Legal because: A was being held and I was clear, so stacking A onto I is permitted.

11) Agent: manipulator_2 — (unstack c d) (s10 -> s11) [t=10.0–11.0s]
    Legal because: C was on D and C was clear (A had been removed), and the hand was empty, so C could be unstacked from D.

12) Agent: manipulator_2 — (stack c a) (s11 -> s12) [t=11.0–12.0s]
    Legal because: C was being held and A was clear, so stacking C onto A is legal.

13) Agent: manipulator_2 — (unstack g j) (s12 -> s13) [t=12.0–13.0s]
    Legal because: G was on J and G was clear (top of that stack), and the hand was empty, so G could be unstacked from J.

14) Agent: manipulator_2 — (stack g f) (s13 -> s14) [t=13.0–14.0s]
    Legal because: G was being held and F was clear (I had been removed earlier), so stacking G onto F is permitted.

15) Agent: manipulator_2 — (unstack c a) (s14 -> s15) [t=14.0–15.0s]
    Legal because: C was on A and C was clear (it had been stacked on A), and the hand was empty, so C could be unstacked from A.

16) Agent: manipulator_2 — (stack c j) (s15 -> s16) [t=15.0–16.0s]
    Legal because: C was being held and J was clear (G had been removed), so stacking C onto J is allowed.

17) Agent: manipulator_2 — (pickup d) (s16 -> s17) [t=16.0–17.0s]
    Legal because: D was on the table and clear (C had been removed earlier), and the hand was empty, so D could be picked up.

18) Agent: manipulator_2 — (putdown d) (s17 -> s18) [t=17.0–18.0s]
    Legal because: D was being held and putdown places the held block on the table; preconditions satisfied.

19) Agent: manipulator_2 — (unstack a i) (s18 -> s19) [t=18.0–19.0s]
    Legal because: A was on I and A was clear (C had been unstacked earlier), and the hand was empty, so A could be unstacked from I.

20) Agent: manipulator_2 — (stack a g) (s19 -> s20) [t=19.0–20.0s]
    Legal because: A was being held and G was clear (G was on F and nothing was on G), so stacking A onto G is permitted.

Final arrangement of every block (immediate relation: "on X" means directly on that block; "on-table" means directly on the table):

- A is on G.
- B is on E.
- C is on J.
- D is on the table.
- E is on the table.
- F is on the table.
- G is on F.
- H is on B.
- I is on H.
- J is on the table.

(These final positions result from applying steps 1–20 in order.)
