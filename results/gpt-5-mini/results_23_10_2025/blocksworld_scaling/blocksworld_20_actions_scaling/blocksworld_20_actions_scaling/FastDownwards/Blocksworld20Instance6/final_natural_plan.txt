    - Action (plain): Put down block A on the table (A is on the table and clear; hand becomes empty).

13) Step 13 — step13-pickup-a
    - Start: 2025-10-21T00:02:00Z — Duration: 10s
    - Action (plain): Pickup block A from the table (A is held).

14) Step 14 — step14-stack-a-h
    - Start: 2025-10-21T00:02:10Z — Duration: 10s

- H is on E

Summary
- All 20 actions from the PDDL plan were executed in order, timestamps and estimated durations given.
- Goal achieved: done s20; final block arrangement matches the specified final arrangement.
- Total estimated execution time: ~200 seconds. Cost = 20 (unit cost).
