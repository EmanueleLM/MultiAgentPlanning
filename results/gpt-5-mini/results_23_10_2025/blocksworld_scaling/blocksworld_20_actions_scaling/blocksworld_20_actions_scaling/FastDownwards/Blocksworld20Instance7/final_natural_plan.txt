Initial state (t = 00:00:00):
- Stacks on table:
  - A (bottom) - B - E - D (top)
  - G (bottom) - H - C - F (top)
- Robots: robot1 and robot2 are handempty.

Step 1 — 00:00:00 → 00:00:04 (robot1_unstack F from C) — duration 4s
- Action: robot1 unstack F from C (robot1 picks up F).
- Preconditions satisfied: F was the top of the stack (on F C) and robot1 was handempty.
- Resulting state:
  - robot1 is holding F.
  - Stacks on table:
    - A - B - E - D (unchanged)
    - G - H - C (C is now clear)
  - On-table: none new (F is held).

Step 2 — 00:00:04 → 00:00:07 (robot1_putdown F) — duration 3s
- Action: robot1 putdown F onto the table.
- Preconditions satisfied: robot1 was holding F.
- Resulting state:
  - robot1 is handempty.
  - F is on the table (F is clear).
  - Stacks on table:
    - A - B - E - D
    - G - H - C
    - F (alone on table)

Step 3 — 00:00:07 → 00:00:11 (robot1_unstack C from H) — duration 4s
- Action: robot1 unstack C from H (robot1 picks up C).
- Preconditions satisfied: C was the top of its stack (after F was removed) and robot1 was handempty.
- Resulting state:
  - robot1 is holding C.
  - Stacks on table:
    - A - B - E - D
    - G - H (H is now clear)
    - F (on table)

Step 4 — 00:00:11 → 00:00:15 (robot1_stack C onto F) — duration 4s
- Action: robot1 stack C onto F (place C on top of F).
- Preconditions satisfied: robot1 was holding C and F was clear (on table).
- Resulting state:
  - robot1 is handempty.
  - Stack on table:
    - F (bottom) - C (top)
  - Other stacks:
    - A - B - E - D
    - G - H

Step 5 — 00:00:15 → 00:00:19 (robot1_unstack D from E) — duration 4s
- Action: robot1 unstack D from E (robot1 picks up D).
- Preconditions satisfied: D was the top of A-B-E-D and robot1 was handempty.
- Resulting state:
  - robot1 is holding D.
  - Stacks on table:
    - A - B - E (E becomes clear)
    - G - H
    - F - C

Step 6 — 00:00:19 → 00:00:22 (robot1_putdown D) — duration 3s
- Action: robot1 putdown D onto the table.
- Preconditions satisfied: robot1 was holding D.
- Resulting state:
  - robot1 is handempty.
  - D is on the table (D clear).
  - Stacks on table:
    - A - B - E
    - G - H
    - F - C
    - D (alone)

Step 7 — 00:00:22 → 00:00:26 (robot1_unstack E from B) — duration 4s
- Action: robot1 unstack E from B (robot1 picks up E).
- Preconditions satisfied: E was the top of A - B - E and robot1 was handempty.
- Resulting state:
  - robot1 is holding E.
  - Stacks on table:
    - A - B (B becomes clear)
    - G - H
    - F - C
    - D

Step 8 — 00:00:26 → 00:00:29 (robot1_putdown E) — duration 3s
- Action: robot1 putdown E onto the table.
- Preconditions satisfied: robot1 was holding E.
- Resulting state:
  - robot1 is handempty.
  - E is on the table (E clear).
  - Stacks on table:
    - A - B
    - E (alone)
    - G - H
    - F - C
    - D

Step 9 — 00:00:29 → 00:00:33 (robot1_unstack B from A) — duration 4s
- Action: robot1 unstack B from A (robot1 picks up B).
- Preconditions satisfied: B was the top of A - B and robot1 was handempty.
- Resulting state:
  - robot1 is holding B.
  - Stacks on table:
    - A (alone, A is now clear)
    - E
    - G - H
    - F - C
    - D

Step 10 — 00:00:33 → 00:00:37 (robot1_stack B onto E) — duration 4s
- Action: robot1 stack B onto E (place B on top of E).
- Preconditions satisfied: robot1 was holding B and E was clear on the table.
- Resulting (final) state at 00:00:37:
  - robot1 is handempty.
  - Stacks on table:
    - A (alone) — clear
    - E (bottom) - B (top) — B clear
    - G - H — H clear
    - F - C — C clear
    - D (alone) — clear

Final facts (human-readable summary):
- On-table: A, E, G, F, D
- On relations: B on E; C on F; H on G
- Clear blocks: A, B, H, D, C
- Both robots: handempty

This sequence exactly follows the provided plan (10 actions by robot1) and results in the final arrangement consistent with the specification and goal.
