Below is a human-readable, step-by-step rendering of the provided plan. Each step lists the agent, the action, the blocks involved, and the timestamps (s0/s30) shown in the plan. When a timestamp changes to a different numeric label I report an implied duration (s0→s30 shown as 30 time units). Where the plan shows a non-monotonic timestamp change (s30→s0) I flag that as non-monotonic.

1. Step 1 — robot1: Unstack C from G. Timestamp: s0 → s0 (duration: 0).  
   - Effect: robot1 picks up C (C removed from on G; C is held by robot1).

2. Step 2 — robot1: Stack C onto H. Timestamp: s0 → s0 (duration: 0).  
   - Effect: robot1 places C on H (C is now on H; robot1 releases C).

3. Step 3 — robot1: Pickup F (from the table). Timestamp: s0 → s0 (duration: 0).  
   - Effect: robot1 picks up F (F removed from table; robot1 holds F).

4. Step 4 — robot1: Putdown F (on the table). Timestamp: s0 → s30 (duration: 30).  
   - Effect: robot1 places F on the table (F becomes ontable; timestamp advanced to s30).

5. Step 5 — robot2: Unstack G from A. Timestamp: s0 → s0 (duration: 0).  
   - Effect: robot2 picks up G (G removed from on A; robot2 holds G).

6. Step 6 — robot2: Stack G onto F. Timestamp: s0 → s0 (duration: 0).  
   - Effect: robot2 places G on F (G is now on F; robot2 releases G).

7. Step 7 — robot1: Unstack C from H. Timestamp: s30 → s0 (non-monotonic change).  
   - Note: plan shows timestamp moving from s30 back to s0 (non-monotonic). Effect: robot1 picks up C from H.

8. Step 8 — robot1: Putdown C (on the table). Timestamp: s0 → s0 (duration: 0).  
   - Effect: robot1 places C on the table (C becomes ontable; robot1 releases C).

9. Step 9 — robot1: Unstack H from D. Timestamp: s0 → s0 (duration: 0).  
   - Effect: robot1 picks up H (H removed from on D; robot1 holds H).

10. Step 10 — robot1: Stack H onto J. Timestamp: s0 → s0 (duration: 0).  
    - Effect: robot1 places H on J (H is now on J; robot1 releases H).

11. Step 11 — robot2: Pickup C (from the table). Timestamp: s0 → s0 (duration: 0).  
    - Effect: robot2 picks up C (C removed from table; robot2 holds C).

12. Step 12 — robot2: Stack C onto H. Timestamp: s0 → s0 (duration: 0).  
    - Effect: robot2 places C on H (C is now on H; robot2 releases C).

13. Step 13 — robot1: Unstack D from I. Timestamp: s0 → s0 (duration: 0).  
    - Effect: robot1 picks up D (D removed from on I; robot1 holds D).

14. Step 14 — robot1: Stack D onto C. Timestamp: s0 → s0 (duration: 0).  
    - Effect: robot1 places D on C (D is now on C; robot1 releases D).

15. Step 15 — robot1: Unstack G from F. Timestamp: s0 → s0 (duration: 0).  
    - Effect: robot1 picks up G (G removed from on F; robot1 holds G).

16. Step 16 — robot1: Putdown G (on the table). Timestamp: s0 → s0 (duration: 0).  
    - Effect: robot1 places G on the table (G becomes ontable; robot1 releases G).

17. Step 17 — robot2: Pickup F (from the table). Timestamp: s0 → s0 (duration: 0).  
    - Effect: robot2 picks up F (F removed from table; robot2 holds F).

18. Step 18 — robot2: Stack F onto I. Timestamp: s0 → s0 (duration: 0).  
    - Effect: robot2 places F on I (F is now on I; robot2 releases F).

19. Step 19 — robot2: Pickup G (from the table). Timestamp: s0 → s0 (duration: 0).  
    - Effect: robot2 picks up G (G removed from table; robot2 holds G).

20. Step 20 — robot2: Stack G onto F. Timestamp: s0 → s0 (duration: 0).  
    - Effect: robot2 places G on F (G is now on F; robot2 releases G).

Final arrangement implied by the completed plan (matches the expected final arrangement):
- A on B  
- B on table  
- C on H  
- D on C  
- E on table  
- F on I  
- G on F  
- H on J  
- I on table  
- J on E

Notes:
- All actions listed exactly follow the provided plan order (20 actions, same agents and moves).
- Timestamp changes are reported exactly as in the plan. The only timestamp change with a positive duration is Step 4 (s0 → s30, interpreted here as 30 time units). Step 7 shows a non-monotonic timestamp change (s30 → s0) as indicated in the plan; no positive duration can be inferred for that step from the plan labels.
