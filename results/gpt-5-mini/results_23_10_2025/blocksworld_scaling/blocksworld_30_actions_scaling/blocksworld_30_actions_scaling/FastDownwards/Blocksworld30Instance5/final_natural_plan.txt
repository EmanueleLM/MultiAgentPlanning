Final derived arrangement (after executing all 30 actions):
- B is on the table.
- E is on B.
- A is on E.
- D is on A.
- G is on the table.
- H is on G.
- F is on H.
- C is on F.

Detailed step-by-step action sequence (timestamps s0 → s30; each action = 1 time unit):

1. [s0 → s1] (1 unit) mover2 unstack H from G.
   - Effect: mover2 is holding H; G becomes clear.

2. [s1 → s2] (1 unit) mover2 stack H onto G.
   - Effect: H is on G; mover2 hand empty.

3. [s2 → s3] (1 unit) mover2 unstack H from G.
   - Effect: mover2 is holding H; G becomes clear.

4. [s3 → s4] (1 unit) mover2 stack H onto G.
   - Effect: H is on G; mover2 hand empty. (G→H same as start of this cycle)

5. [s4 → s5] (1 unit) mover2 pickup F from the table.
   - Effect: mover2 is holding F; F no longer on table.

6. [s5 → s6] (1 unit) mover2 putdown F onto the table.
   - Effect: F is on the table; mover2 hand empty.

7. [s6 → s7] (1 unit) mover2 pickup F from the table.
   - Effect: mover2 is holding F.

8. [s7 → s8] (1 unit) mover2 stack F onto H.
   - Effect: F is on H (stack G → H → F); mover2 hand empty.

9. [s8 → s9] (1 unit) mover1 unstack C from B.
   - Effect: mover1 is holding C; B becomes clear.

10. [s9 → s10] (1 unit) mover1 putdown C onto the table.
    - Effect: C is on the table; mover1 hand empty.

11. [s10 → s11] (1 unit) mover1 pickup C from the table.
    - Effect: mover1 is holding C.

12. [s11 → s12] (1 unit) mover1 stack C onto F.
    - Effect: C is on F (stack G → H → F → C); mover1 hand empty.

13. [s12 → s13] (1 unit) mover1 unstack B from E.
    - Effect: mover1 is holding B; E becomes clear.

14. [s13 → s14] (1 unit) mover1 putdown B onto the table.
    - Effect: B is on the table; mover1 hand empty.

15. [s14 → s15] (1 unit) mover1 unstack E from A.
    - Effect: mover1 is holding E; A becomes clear.

16. [s15 → s16] (1 unit) mover1 stack E onto B.
    - Effect: E is on B (B → E); mover1 hand empty.

17. [s16 → s17] (1 unit) mover1 unstack A from D.
    - Effect: mover1 is holding A; D becomes clear.

18. [s17 → s18] (1 unit) mover1 stack A onto E.
    - Effect: A is on E (B → E → A); mover1 hand empty.

19. [s18 → s19] (1 unit) mover1 pickup D from the table.
    - Effect: mover1 is holding D.

20. [s19 → s20] (1 unit) mover1 putdown D onto the table.
    - Effect: D is on the table; mover1 hand empty.

21. [s20 → s21] (1 unit) mover1 unstack C from F.
    - Effect: mover1 is holding C; F becomes clear.

22. [s21 → s22] (1 unit) mover1 stack C onto F.
    - Effect: C is back on F (G → H → F → C); mover1 hand empty.

23. [s22 → s23] (1 unit) mover1 unstack C from F.
    - Effect: mover1 is holding C; F becomes clear.

24. [s23 → s24] (1 unit) mover1 stack C onto A.
    - Effect: C is on A (B → E → A → C); mover1 hand empty.

25. [s24 → s25] (1 unit) mover1 unstack C from A.
    - Effect: mover1 is holding C; A becomes clear.

26. [s25 → s26] (1 unit) mover1 stack C onto D.
    - Effect: C is on D (D → C); mover1 hand empty.

27. [s26 → s27] (1 unit) mover1 unstack C from D.
    - Effect: mover1 is holding C; D becomes clear.

28. [s27 → s28] (1 unit) mover1 stack C onto F.
    - Effect: C is on F (G → H → F → C) again; mover1 hand empty.

29. [s28 → s29] (1 unit) mover1 pickup D from the table.
    - Effect: mover1 is holding D; D removed from table.

30. [s29 → s30] (1 unit) mover1 stack D onto A.
    - Effect: D is on A. Final stacks: B → E → A → D (top D) and G → H → F → C (top C).

Plan cost: 30 actions (unit cost each).
