Summary: execution of the given 30-step plan. Assume each action takes 1 time unit. Timestamps shown as [start — end) in units.

Step 1  [0 — 1): pickup(H)
  - Pick up block H from the table (H was on the table and clear).

Step 2  [1 — 2): stack(H, F)
  - Place block H onto block F (stack H on top of F).

Step 3  [2 — 3): unstack(H, F)
  - Remove block H from on top of F (pick H up from F).

Step 4  [3 — 4): stack(H, I)
  - Place block H onto block I (stack H on top of I).

Step 5  [4 — 5): unstack(H, I)
  - Remove block H from on top of I (pick H up from I).

Step 6  [5 — 6): stack(H, I)
  - Place block H onto block I again (stack H on top of I).

Step 7  [6 — 7): unstack(H, I)
  - Remove block H from on top of I (pick H up from I).

Step 8  [7 — 8): stack(H, I)
  - Place block H onto block I again (stack H on top of I).

Step 9  [8 — 9): unstack(H, I)
  - Remove block H from on top of I (pick H up from I).

Step 10 [9 — 10): putdown(H)
  - Put block H down onto the table (H becomes on-table and clear).

Step 11 [10 — 11): unstack(I, C)
  - Remove block I from on top of C (pick I up from C).

Step 12 [11 — 12): putdown(I)
  - Put block I down onto the table (I becomes on-table and clear).

Step 13 [12 — 13): unstack(C, J)
  - Remove block C from on top of J (pick C up from J).

Step 14 [13 — 14): stack(C, F)
  - Place block C onto block F (stack C on top of F).

Step 15 [14 — 15): unstack(J, E)
  - Remove block J from on top of E (pick J up from E).

Step 16 [15 — 16): stack(J, H)
  - Place block J onto block H (stack J on top of H).

Step 17 [16 — 17): pickup(I)
  - Pick up block I from the table (I was on the table and clear).

Step 18 [17 — 18): stack(I, C)
  - Place block I onto block C (stack I on top of C).

Step 19 [18 — 19): pickup(E)
  - Pick up block E from the table (E was on the table and clear).

Step 20 [19 — 20): stack(E, J)
  - Place block E onto block J (stack E on top of J).

Step 21 [20 — 21): unstack(E, J)
  - Remove block E from on top of J (pick E up from J).

Step 22 [21 — 22): stack(E, I)
  - Place block E onto block I (stack E on top of I).

Step 23 [22 — 23): unstack(E, I)
  - Remove block E from on top of I (pick E up from I).

Step 24 [23 — 24): putdown(E)
  - Put block E down onto the table (E becomes on-table and clear).

Step 25 [24 — 25): unstack(I, C)
  - Remove block I from on top of C (pick I up from C).

Step 26 [25 — 26): stack(I, E)
  - Place block I onto block E (stack I on top of E).

Step 27 [26 — 27): unstack(J, H)
  - Remove block J from on top of H (pick J up from H).

Step 28 [27 — 28): stack(J, H)
  - Place block J onto block H (stack J on top of H).

Step 29 [28 — 29): unstack(J, H)
  - Remove block J from on top of H (pick J up from H).

Step 30 [29 — 30): stack(J, C)
  - Place block J onto block C (stack J on top of C).

Total execution time: 30 time units (30 actions × 1 unit each).

Final arrangement (bottom → top / table status), consistent with the executed actions:
  - Stack1: D (on table) → A (on D) → G (on A) → B (on G) → K (on B) → F (on K) → C (on F) → J (on C)
  - Stack2: E (on table) → I (on E)
  - Stack3: H (on table)

Stated per-block final relations:
  - A is on D
  - B is on G
  - C is on F
  - D is on the table
  - E is on the table
  - F is on K
  - G is on A
  - H is on the table
  - I is on E
  - J is on C
  - K is on B

Plan cost: 30 (unit cost).
