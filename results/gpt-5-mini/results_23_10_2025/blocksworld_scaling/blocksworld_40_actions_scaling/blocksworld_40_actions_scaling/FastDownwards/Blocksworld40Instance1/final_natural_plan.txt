Chronological human-readable execution trace (matches plan exactly):

Step 1 — 00:00:00 — Unstack by agent1
- Action: agent1 unstacked block b from block f (unstack agent1 b f).
- Preconditions observed immediately before action:
  - on(b, f) — true
  - clear(b) — true
  - handempty — true
- Execution note: agent1 lifted b off f without interference.
- Duration: 3.0 s (00:00:00 → 00:00:03)
- Immediate effects observed after action:
  - agent1 is holding b
  - b is no longer on f
  - f became clear
  - hand is no longer empty
- Deviations/failures: none

Step 2 — 00:00:03 — Stack by agent1
- Action: agent1 stacked block b onto block e (stack agent1 b e).
- Preconditions observed immediately before action:
  - holding(agent1, b) — true (from Step 1)
  - clear(e) — true
- Execution note: agent1 placed b on top of e successfully.
- Duration: 2.5 s (00:00:03 → 00:00:05.5)
- Immediate effects observed after action:
  - on(b, e) — true
  - clear(b) — true
  - e is no longer clear
  - agent1 is no longer holding b
  - handempty — true
- Deviations/failures: none

Final confirmation (after Step 2, t ≈ 00:00:05.5)
- Achieved final arrangement (matches goal):
  - on b e
  - on e g
  - on g a
  - on a d
  - on d i
  - on i c
  - on c h
  - ontable f
  - ontable h
  - handempty
- All executed actions complied with the BlocksWorld rules; no conflicts or failures were observed.
