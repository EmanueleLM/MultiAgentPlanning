Initial world state (time 00:00:00):
- Stacks (bottom-to-top): [A], [B D], [C G F J I K], [E H]
- Held: none (hand empty)
- Notes: clear tops = A, D, K, H

Plan (actions executed by robot1). Each action duration: 1.0 s. Total plan cost = 4, total duration = 4.0 s.

1) 00:00:00 → 00:00:01 — robot1: unstack(D, B)
- Action: robot1 unstacks block D from on top of B and holds D.
- Effects:
  - D is held by robot1.
  - D is no longer on B.
  - B becomes clear.
  - hand becomes not empty (a block is held).
- Local configuration after step:
  - Stacks (bottom-to-top): [A], [B], [C G F J I K], [E H]
  - Held: D
  - Clear tops: A, B, K, H, (and others as appropriate)

2) 00:00:01 → 00:00:02 — robot1: stack(D, H)
- Action: robot1 places the held block D onto block H.
- Effects:
  - D is on H.
  - D becomes clear (top).
  - H is no longer clear.
  - robot1's hand becomes empty.
- Local configuration after step:
  - Stacks (bottom-to-top): [A], [B], [C G F J I K], [E H D]
  - Held: none
  - Clear tops: A, B, K, D

3) 00:00:02 → 00:00:03 — robot1: unstack(K, I)
- Action: robot1 unstacks block K from on top of I and holds K.
- Effects:
  - K is held by robot1.
  - K is no longer on I.
  - I becomes clear.
  - hand becomes not empty.
- Local configuration after step:
  - Stacks (bottom-to-top): [A], [B], [C G F J I], [E H D]
  - Held: K
  - Clear tops: A, B, I, D

4) 00:00:03 → 00:00:04 — robot1: stack(K, A)
- Action: robot1 places the held block K onto block A.
- Effects:
  - K is on A.
  - K becomes clear.
  - A is no longer clear.
  - robot1's hand becomes empty.
- Local configuration after step (final state):
  - Stacks (bottom-to-top): [A K], [B], [C G F J I], [E H D]
  - Held: none (hand empty)
  - Clear tops: K, B, I, D

Final arrangement (explicit per-block):
- A is on the table; K is on top of A.
- B is on the table.
- C is on the table; G is on top of C.
- G is on C; F is on top of G.
- F is on G; J is on top of F.
- J is on F; I is on top of J.
- I is on J.
- E is on the table; H is on top of E; D is on top of H.
- No block is held (handempty).

Plan complete. Total actions executed: 4 (all by robot1). Total duration: 4.0 s.
