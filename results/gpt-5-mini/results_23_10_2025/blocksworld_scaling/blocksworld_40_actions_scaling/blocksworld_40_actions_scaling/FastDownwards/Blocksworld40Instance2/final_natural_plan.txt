Sequence of actions (as in the given plan). Each step lists: action, start time, duration, preconditions checked, immediate effect, and the updated world state (stacks bottom -> ... -> top). Start time t = 00:00:00; assume each action takes 5s.

Initial configuration (t = 00:00:00 before any action)
- Stacks (bottom -> ... -> top):
  1. G, A, J
  2. I, B
  3. C
  4. H, D, F, E
- Clear blocks: J, B, C, E
- Hand: empty

1) t=00:00:00 — 00:00:05 (duration 5s)
Action: unstack(b, i)
- Preconditions checked: B is on I; B is clear; hand is empty. All satisfied.
- Immediate effect: pick up B from on top of I. B is now being held; B is no longer on I; I becomes clear; hand becomes not empty.
- State after action:
  - Holding: B
  - Stacks:
    1. G, A, J
    2. I
    3. C
    4. H, D, F, E
    5. (B is being held, not on table)
  - Clear blocks: J, I, C, E

2) t=00:00:05 — 00:00:10 (duration 5s)
Action: putdown(b)
- Preconditions checked: holding B. Satisfied.
- Immediate effect: put B down onto the table. B becomes ontable and clear; hand becomes empty; B is no longer held.
- State after action:
  - Holding: none (hand empty)
  - Stacks:
    1. G, A, J
    2. I
    3. C
    4. H, D, F, E
    5. B  (singleton on table)
  - Clear blocks: J, I, C, E, B

3) t=00:00:10 — 00:00:15 (duration 5s)
Action: pickup(c)
- Preconditions checked: C is on the table (ontable C); C is clear; hand is empty. All satisfied.
- Immediate effect: pick up C from the table. C is now held; C is no longer on the table; hand becomes not empty.
- State after action:
  - Holding: C
  - Stacks:
    1. G, A, J
    2. I
    3. (C removed)
    4. H, D, F, E
    5. B
  - Clear blocks: J, I, E, B  (C is held, not clear)

4) t=00:00:15 — 00:00:20 (duration 5s)
Action: stack(c, j)
- Preconditions checked: holding C; J is clear. Both satisfied.
- Immediate effect: place C on top of J. C is now on J; C becomes clear; J is no longer clear; hand becomes empty; C is no longer held.
- State after action:
  - Holding: none (hand empty)
  - Stacks:
    1. G, A, J, C
    2. I
    3. (empty)
    4. H, D, F, E
    5. B
  - Clear blocks: C, I, E, B

5) t=00:00:20 — 00:00:25 (duration 5s)
Action: unstack(e, f)
- Preconditions checked: E is on F; E is clear; hand is empty. All satisfied.
- Immediate effect: pick up E from on top of F. E is now held; E is no longer on F; F becomes clear; hand becomes not empty.
- State after action:
  - Holding: E
  - Stacks:
    1. G, A, J, C
    2. I
    3. (empty)
    4. H, D, F
    5. B
  - Clear blocks: C, F, I, B  (E is held)

6) t=00:00:25 — 00:00:30 (duration 5s)
Action: stack(e, i)
- Preconditions checked: holding E; I is clear. Both satisfied (I became clear after step 1).
- Immediate effect: place E on top of I. E is now on I; E becomes clear; I is no longer clear; hand becomes empty; E is no longer held.
- State after action:
  - Holding: none (hand empty)
  - Stacks:
    1. G, A, J, C
    2. I, E
    3. (empty)
    4. H, D, F
    5. B
  - Clear blocks: C, E, F, B

7) t=00:00:30 — 00:00:35 (duration 5s)
Action: unstack(f, d)
- Preconditions checked: F is on D; F is clear (became clear when E was removed); hand is empty. All satisfied.
- Immediate effect: pick up F from on top of D. F is now held; F is no longer on D; D becomes clear; hand becomes not empty.
- State after action:
  - Holding: F
  - Stacks:
    1. G, A, J, C
    2. I, E
    3. (empty)
    4. H, D
    5. B
  - Clear blocks: C, E, D, B  (F is held)

8) t=00:00:35 — 00:00:40 (duration 5s)
Action: putdown(f)
- Preconditions checked: holding F. Satisfied.
- Immediate effect: put F down onto the table. F becomes ontable and clear; hand becomes empty.
- Final state after action (t = 00:00:40):
  - Holding: none (hand empty)
  - Final stacks (bottom -> ... -> top):
    1. G, A, J, C
    2. I, E
    3. H, D
    4. F
    5. B
  - Final placement summary for each block:
    - A on G
    - B on table
    - C on J
    - D on H
    - E on I
    - F on table
    - G on table
    - H on table
    - I on table
    - J on A
  - Clear blocks (tops): C, E, D, F, B

This sequence exactly follows the given plan and results in the required final arrangement.
