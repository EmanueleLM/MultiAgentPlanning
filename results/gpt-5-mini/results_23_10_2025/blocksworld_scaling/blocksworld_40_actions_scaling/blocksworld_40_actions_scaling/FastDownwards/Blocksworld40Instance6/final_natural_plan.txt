Plan (16 steps). Each step timestamped t=1..16 (assume 1 time unit per action).

1) t=1 (worker1) — unstack C from B
   - worker1 removes block C from on top of B and holds C. B becomes clear.

2) t=2 (worker2) — unstack B from I
   - worker2 removes block B from on top of I and holds B. I becomes clear.

3) t=3 (worker1) — put down C
   - worker1 places C onto the table and releases it (C is now on-table and clear).

4) t=4 (worker1) — unstack H from G
   - worker1 removes block H from on top of G and holds H. G becomes clear.

5) t=5 (worker1) — stack H onto C
   - worker1 places H on top of C. H is now on C; C is no longer clear.

6) t=6 (worker1) — unstack J from L
   - worker1 removes block J from on top of L and holds J. L becomes clear.

7) t=7 (worker1) — put down J
   - worker1 places J onto the table and releases it (J is now on-table and clear).

8) t=8 (worker1) — unstack L from K
   - worker1 removes block L from on top of K and holds L. K becomes clear.

9) t=9 (worker2) — stack B onto K
   - worker2 places B (held since t=2) onto K. B is now on K; K is no longer clear.

10) t=10 (worker2) — unstack G from D
    - worker2 removes block G from on top of D and holds G. D becomes clear.

11) t=11 (worker1) — stack L onto I
    - worker1 places L (held since t=8) onto I. L is now on I; I is no longer clear.

12) t=12 (worker2) — stack G onto J
    - worker2 places G (held since t=10) onto J. G is now on J; J is no longer clear.

13) t=13 (worker1) — unstack L from I
    - worker1 removes block L from on top of I and holds L again. I becomes clear.

14) t=14 (worker2) — pickup I
    - worker2 picks up I from the table (I was on-table and clear) and holds I.

15) t=15 (worker2) — stack I onto A
    - worker2 places I onto A. I is now on A; A is no longer clear.

16) t=16 (worker1) — stack L onto I
    - worker1 places L (held since t=13) onto I. L is now on I.

Final arrangement after step 16 (matches goal):
- A is on the table
- I is on A
- L is on I
- C is on the table
- H is on C
- F is on the table
- E is on F
- D is on E
- K is on the table
- B is on K
- J is on the table
- G is on J

Total cost: 16 actions (unit cost per action).
