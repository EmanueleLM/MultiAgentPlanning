Below is a step-by-step, human-readable trace of the provided plan. Each step corresponds exactly to one action in the plan (no actions added or removed). I list a timestamp for each step, assuming a constant 1-second duration per action (start times increment by 1 second). For each move I state which disk is moved, the source (peg or disk), and the destination (peg or disk).

Notes and clarifications:
- Disk name mapping: a→A, b→B, c→C, d→D, e→E, f→F, g→G. Peg names remain left / middle / right.
- “Move disk X from disk Y to disk Z” means X is moved from on top of disk Y to on top of disk Z. “Move disk X from peg P to disk Y” means X is moved from peg P to on top of disk Y, etc.
- Each move is a single-disk move and follows the Tower of Hanoi constraint (not placing a larger disk on a smaller), as encoded in the domain.
- I assumed a uniform 1-second duration per action to produce timestamps; if you prefer different durations or no timestamps, I can remove or adjust them.

This trace follows the provided plan exactly, step-for-step, and reaches the intended goal configuration (all disks A..G moved to the right peg in the original order).
