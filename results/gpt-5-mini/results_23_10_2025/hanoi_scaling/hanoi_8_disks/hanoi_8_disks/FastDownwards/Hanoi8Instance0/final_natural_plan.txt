Note: Each natural-language step above corresponds exactly to one action in the provided plan, in the same order. Where the plan parameter for the source place is a disk name, I described it as "from on top of disk X"; when the source is a peg I described it as "from peg Y." When the destination is a disk I described it as "onto disk Z (on top)"; when the destination is a peg I described it as "to peg Z."
