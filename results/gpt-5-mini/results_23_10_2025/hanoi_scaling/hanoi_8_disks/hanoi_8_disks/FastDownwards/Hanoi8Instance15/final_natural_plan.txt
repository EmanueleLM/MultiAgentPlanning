Below is a step-by-step, human-readable rendering of the provided PDDL plan. Each line shows the original plan action, a one-line plain-language description of the move, and a timestamp assuming each action takes 1 second, starting at 00:00:00. Disk letters are shown in uppercase for clarity (a→A, b→B, c→C, d→D, e→E, f→F, g→G, h→H). No actions were added or removed — the sequence matches the plan exactly.

End of plan. Total actions: 294. Total (assumed) duration: 294 seconds (4 minutes 54 seconds).

Notes/assurances:
- Each step above corresponds exactly to one action in the PDDL plan; no actions were added or removed.
- The natural-language description respects the Tower of Hanoi constraints implied by the domain: every action moves a single top disk onto either a peg or another (larger) disk.
- Timestamps assume uniform 1-second action duration for readability; if you prefer different durations, I can relabel them.
