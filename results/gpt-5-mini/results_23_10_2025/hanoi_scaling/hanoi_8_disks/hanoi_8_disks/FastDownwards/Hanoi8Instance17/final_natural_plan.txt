Step 292 (t = 292s): ; (final action comment)
- (Plan end; last explicit action was previous line. Total reported cost = 294 in original plan.)

Note: The plan as provided contains 293 explicit move actions followed by a final comment line in the plan file indicating cost = 294. I preserved every action line in order and produced a human-readable description for each. If you want these steps in a different timestamp granularity (e.g., a realistic per-move duration or wall-clock timestamps starting at a particular time), tell me the start time and per-move duration and I will annotate accordingly.
