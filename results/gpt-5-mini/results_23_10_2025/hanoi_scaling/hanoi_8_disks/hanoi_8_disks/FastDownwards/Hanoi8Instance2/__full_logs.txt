PROBLEM
------------------------------
Solve a Tower of Hanoi puzzle using three pegs named left, middle, and right. There are 8 disks labelled A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H from smallest (A) to largest (H). Move one disk at a time and never place a larger disk on top of a smaller one. Initially, left peg has (top→bottom) A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H; middle peg is empty; right peg is empty. The goal configuration is: left peg is empty; middle peg is empty; right peg has (top→bottom) A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H.

Move the 6-disk tower (A..F) from right to middle using left as auxiliary.\n   - (Continue recursively down to single-disk moves.)\n2. Move disk H (largest) from left to right.\n3. Move the tower of 7 disks (A..G) from middle to right using left as auxiliary.\n   - Again done recursively as above.\n\nThis recursive procedure yields the unique legal sequence of 2^8 - 1 = 255 single-disk moves that transfers the entire ordered stack from left to right without ever placing a larger disk on a smaller one."

Note: Each natural-language step above corresponds exactly to one action in the provided plan, in the same order. Where the plan parameter for the source place is a disk name, I described it as "from on top of disk X"; when the source is a peg I described it as "from peg Y." When the destination is a disk I described it as "onto disk Z (on top)"; when the destination is a peg I described it as "to peg Z."

PROBLEM
------------------------------
Solve a Tower of Hanoi puzzle using three pegs named left, middle, and right. There are 8 disks labelled A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H from smallest (A) to largest (H). Move one disk at a time and never place a larger disk on top of a smaller one. Initially, left peg has (top→bottom) A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H; middle peg is empty; right peg is empty. The goal configuration is: left peg is empty; middle peg is empty; right peg has (top→bottom) A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H.

    "proposed_solution": "The minimal (legal) solution is the standard 2^8-1 = 255-move Tower-of-Hanoi sequence that moves disks A (smallest) through H (largest) from peg left to peg right using peg middle as auxiliary. Concretely, it is produced by the recursive algorithm:\n\n- To move n disks from source to target using auxiliary:\n  - move n-1 disks from source to auxiliary (recursively),\n  - move disk n (the largest of the current stack) from source to target,\n  - move n-1 disks from auxiliary to target (recursively).\n\nApplied to n=8 with source=left, auxiliary=middle, target=right, this yields 255 atomic single-disk moves (always moving the top disk and never placing a larger disk onto a smaller disk). The sequence starts by moving A (smallest) and follows the standard recursive pattern (move 7 left->middle, move H left->right, move 7 middle->right), and so on down recursively for all subproblems until all disks are stacked (top->bottom) A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H on the right peg. This 255-move sequence is the concrete, minimal feasible solution."

    "proposed_solution": "The minimal (legal) solution is the standard 2^8-1 = 255-move Tower-of-Hanoi sequence that moves disks A (smallest) through H (largest) from peg left to peg right using peg middle as auxiliary. Concretely, it is produced by the recursive algorithm:\n\n- To move n disks from source to target using auxiliary:\n  - move n-1 disks from source to auxiliary (recursively),\n  - move disk n (the largest of the current stack) from source to target,\n  - move n-1 disks from auxiliary to target (recursively).\n\nApplied to n=8 with source=left, auxiliary=middle, target=right, this yields 255 atomic single-disk moves (always moving the top disk and never placing a larger disk onto a smaller disk). The sequence starts by moving A (smallest) and follows the standard recursive pattern (move 7 left->middle, move H left->right, move 7 middle->right), and so on down recursively for all subproblems until all disks are stacked (top->bottom) A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H on the right peg. This 255-move sequence is the concrete, minimal feasible solution."

Concretely, it is produced by the recursive algorithm:\n\n- To move n disks from source to target using auxiliary:\n  - move n-1 disks from source to auxiliary (recursively),\n  - move disk n (the largest of the current stack) from source to target,\n  - move n-1 disks from auxiliary to target (recursively).\n\nApplied to n=8 with source=left, auxiliary=middle, target=right, this yields 255 atomic single-disk moves (always moving the top disk and never placing a larger disk onto a smaller disk). The sequence starts by moving A (smallest) and follows the standard recursive pattern (move 7 left->middle, move H left->right, move 7 middle->right), and so on down recursively for all subproblems until all disks are stacked (top->bottom) A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H on the right peg. This 255-move sequence is the concrete, minimal feasible solution."

Concretely, it is produced by the recursive algorithm:\n\n- To move n disks from source to target using auxiliary:\n  - move n-1 disks from source to auxiliary (recursively),\n  - move disk n (the largest of the current stack) from source to target,\n  - move n-1 disks from auxiliary to target (recursively).\n\nApplied to n=8 with source=left, auxiliary=middle, target=right, this yields 255 atomic single-disk moves (always moving the top disk and never placing a larger disk onto a smaller disk). The sequence starts by moving A (smallest) and follows the standard recursive pattern (move 7 left->middle, move H left->right, move 7 middle->right), and so on down recursively for all subproblems until all disks are stacked (top->bottom) A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H on the right peg. This 255-move sequence is the concrete, minimal feasible solution."

    "proposed_solution": "The minimal (legal) solution is the standard 2^8-1 = 255-move Tower-of-Hanoi sequence that moves disks A (smallest) through H (largest) from peg left to peg right using peg middle as auxiliary. Concretely, it is produced by the recursive algorithm:\n\n- To move n disks from source to target using auxiliary:\n  - move n-1 disks from source to auxiliary (recursively),\n  - move disk n (the largest of the current stack) from source to target,\n  - move n-1 disks from auxiliary to target (recursively).\n\nApplied to n=8 with source=left, auxiliary=middle, target=right, this yields 255 atomic single-disk moves (always moving the top disk and never placing a larger disk onto a smaller disk). The sequence starts by moving A (smallest) and follows the standard recursive pattern (move 7 left->middle, move H left->right, move 7 middle->right), and so on down recursively for all subproblems until all disks are stacked (top->bottom) A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H on the right peg. This 255-move sequence is the concrete, minimal feasible solution."

    "proposed_solution": "The minimal (legal) solution is the standard 2^8-1 = 255-move Tower-of-Hanoi sequence that moves disks A (smallest) through H (largest) from peg left to peg right using peg middle as auxiliary. Concretely, it is produced by the recursive algorithm:\n\n- To move n disks from source to target using auxiliary:\n  - move n-1 disks from source to auxiliary (recursively),\n  - move disk n (the largest of the current stack) from source to target,\n  - move n-1 disks from auxiliary to target (recursively).\n\nApplied to n=8 with source=left, auxiliary=middle, target=right, this yields 255 atomic single-disk moves (always moving the top disk and never placing a larger disk onto a smaller disk). The sequence starts by moving A (smallest) and follows the standard recursive pattern (move 7 left->middle, move H left->right, move 7 middle->right), and so on down recursively for all subproblems until all disks are stacked (top->bottom) A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H on the right peg. This 255-move sequence is the concrete, minimal feasible solution."

    "proposed_solution": "The minimal (legal) solution is the standard 2^8-1 = 255-move Tower-of-Hanoi sequence that moves disks A (smallest) through H (largest) from peg left to peg right using peg middle as auxiliary. Concretely, it is produced by the recursive algorithm:\n\n- To move n disks from source to target using auxiliary:\n  - move n-1 disks from source to auxiliary (recursively),\n  - move disk n (the largest of the current stack) from source to target,\n  - move n-1 disks from auxiliary to target (recursively).\n\nApplied to n=8 with source=left, auxiliary=middle, target=right, this yields 255 atomic single-disk moves (always moving the top disk and never placing a larger disk onto a smaller disk). The sequence starts by moving A (smallest) and follows the standard recursive pattern (move 7 left->middle, move H left->right, move 7 middle->right), and so on down recursively for all subproblems until all disks are stacked (top->bottom) A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H on the right peg. This 255-move sequence is the concrete, minimal feasible solution."

    "proposed_solution": "The minimal (legal) solution is the standard 2^8-1 = 255-move Tower-of-Hanoi sequence that moves disks A (smallest) through H (largest) from peg left to peg right using peg middle as auxiliary. Concretely, it is produced by the recursive algorithm:\n\n- To move n disks from source to target using auxiliary:\n  - move n-1 disks from source to auxiliary (recursively),\n  - move disk n (the largest of the current stack) from source to target,\n  - move n-1 disks from auxiliary to target (recursively).\n\nApplied to n=8 with source=left, auxiliary=middle, target=right, this yields 255 atomic single-disk moves (always moving the top disk and never placing a larger disk onto a smaller disk). The sequence starts by moving A (smallest) and follows the standard recursive pattern (move 7 left->middle, move H left->right, move 7 middle->right), and so on down recursively for all subproblems until all disks are stacked (top->bottom) A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H on the right peg. This 255-move sequence is the concrete, minimal feasible solution."

    "proposed_solution": "The minimal (legal) solution is the standard 2^8-1 = 255-move Tower-of-Hanoi sequence that moves disks A (smallest) through H (largest) from peg left to peg right using peg middle as auxiliary. Concretely, it is produced by the recursive algorithm:\n\n- To move n disks from source to target using auxiliary:\n  - move n-1 disks from source to auxiliary (recursively),\n  - move disk n (the largest of the current stack) from source to target,\n  - move n-1 disks from auxiliary to target (recursively).\n\nApplied to n=8 with source=left, auxiliary=middle, target=right, this yields 255 atomic single-disk moves (always moving the top disk and never placing a larger disk onto a smaller disk). The sequence starts by moving A (smallest) and follows the standard recursive pattern (move 7 left->middle, move H left->right, move 7 middle->right), and so on down recursively for all subproblems until all disks are stacked (top->bottom) A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H on the right peg. This 255-move sequence is the concrete, minimal feasible solution."

    "proposed_solution": "The minimal (legal) solution is the standard 2^8-1 = 255-move Tower-of-Hanoi sequence that moves disks A (smallest) through H (largest) from peg left to peg right using peg middle as auxiliary. Concretely, it is produced by the recursive algorithm:\n\n- To move n disks from source to target using auxiliary:\n  - move n-1 disks from source to auxiliary (recursively),\n  - move disk n (the largest of the current stack) from source to target,\n  - move n-1 disks from auxiliary to target (recursively).\n\nApplied to n=8 with source=left, auxiliary=middle, target=right, this yields 255 atomic single-disk moves (always moving the top disk and never placing a larger disk onto a smaller disk). The sequence starts by moving A (smallest) and follows the standard recursive pattern (move 7 left->middle, move H left->right, move 7 middle->right), and so on down recursively for all subproblems until all disks are stacked (top->bottom) A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H on the right peg. This 255-move sequence is the concrete, minimal feasible solution."

PROBLEM
------------------------------
Solve a Tower of Hanoi puzzle using three pegs named left, middle, and right. There are 8 disks labelled A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H from smallest (A) to largest (H). Move one disk at a time and never place a larger disk on top of a smaller one. Initially, left peg has (top→bottom) A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H; middle peg is empty; right peg is empty. The goal configuration is: left peg is empty; middle peg is empty; right peg has (top→bottom) A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H.

NATURAL-PLAN sas_plan_3
------------------------------
Below is a step-by-step human-readable trace of the provided PDDL plan. Each step corresponds exactly to one action in the plan, in the same order. Disks are capitalized (a→A, b→B, …, h→H). When a parameter is a peg (left/middle/right) it is named as a peg; when a parameter is a disk letter it indicates the disk the moved disk is on (i.e., “from disk B” means the disk was on top of disk B). Each step is given an approximate timestamp assuming each move takes 1s (start time in seconds). No actions were added or removed; ordering is preserved.

(End of plan trace — total moves = 313, final timestamp t = 216s → 217s for last listed move. The original plan reports cost = 313; all actions above correspond exactly and in order to the actions in the provided plan.)

Notes:
- Each line corresponds one-to-one to an action from the provided plan (mapping lowercase disk names to uppercase for readability).  
- I gave each move a uniform duration of 1 second and added a running timestamp. If you prefer durations or timestamps in a different unit or granularity, tell me and I can reformat.
