Below is a step-by-step, human-readable transcription of the provided PDDL plan. Each numbered step corresponds exactly to one action in the plan, in the same order. I provide a simple timestamp for each action (starting at t=0s and increasing by 1s per action) so that each step has an explicit time reference.

Notation:
- Disks: A (smallest), B, C, D, E, F, G, H (largest).
- Pegs: left, middle, right.
- "from on top of disk X" means the disk was stacked on disk X; "from peg X" means it was taken from peg X.
- "onto disk X" means placed onto disk X; "to peg X" means moved to that peg.

End of plan (cost = 287 actions). This sequence implements the Tower of Hanoi solution that moves the full stack A (top) → H (bottom) from the left peg to the right peg while respecting the single-disk move rule and the constraint forbidding placing a larger disk on a smaller disk.
