Here is the set of actions readable by humans that correlates with the given PDDL plan to solve the task where Alice and Bob meet in the connected rooms:

1. **Action: Alice moves from Room 1 to Room 2.**
   - **Description:** Alice, who starts off in Room 1, decides to move to Room 2. This is possible because Rooms 1 and 2 are directly connected to each other.
   - **Timestamp:** Start at 0 minutes (assuming immediate action commencement).

2. **Action: Alice meets Bob in Room 2.**
   - **Description:** After arriving in Room 2, Alice encounters Bob there, allowing them to formally meet. This completes the goal of both agents meeting each other.
   - **Timestamp:** At approximately 1 minute after the move is completed, depending on the walking speed between rooms.

The above two actions satisfy the final goal of the task, which is for Alice and Bob to meet, within a cost of two unit actions as specified in the PDDL plan.
