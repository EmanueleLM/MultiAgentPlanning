PROBLEM
------------------------------
You are an expert at scheduling meetings. You are given a few constraints on the existing schedule of each participant, the meeting duration, and possibly some preferences on the meeting time. Note there exists a solution that works with existing schedule of every participant. Here are a few example tasks and solutions:

TASK: You need to schedule a meeting for Michelle, Steven and Jerry for one hour between the work hours of 9:00 to 17:00 on Monday. 

Here are the existing schedules for everyone during the day: 
Michelle has meetings on Monday during 11:00 to 12:00; 
Steven has blocked their calendar on Monday during 9:00 to 9:30, 11:30 to 12:00, 13:30 to 14:00, 15:30 to 16:00; 
Jerry has blocked their calendar on Monday during 9:00 to 9:30, 10:00 to 11:00, 11:30 to 12:30, 13:00 to 14:30, 15:30 to 16:00, 16:30 to 17:00; 

Find a time that works for everyone's schedule and constraints.

1) jerry_confirm t14_30 t15_00
   - Jerry confirms he is available for the one-hour meeting starting at 14:30. 
   - Time covered: 14:30–15:30 (two consecutive half-hour slots: 14:30–15:00 and 15:00–15:30).

2) michelle_confirm t14_30 t15_00
   - Michelle confirms she is available for the same one-hour meeting starting at 14:30.
   - Time covered: 14:30–15:30.

3) steven_confirm t14_30 t15_00
   - Steven confirms he is available for the same one-hour meeting starting at 14:30.
   - Time covered: 14:30–15:30.

4) schedule_meeting t14_30
   - The meeting is scheduled to start at 14:30.
   - Confirmed meeting time: Monday 14:30–15:30 (duration: 60 minutes).

5) achieve_goal t14_30
   - Final goal achieved: a one-hour meeting on Monday from 14:30 to 15:30 is scheduled and works for all participants.

PROBLEM
------------------------------
You are an expert at scheduling meetings. You are given a few constraints on the existing schedule of each participant, the meeting duration, and possibly some preferences on the meeting time. Note there exists a solution that works with existing schedule of every participant. Here are a few example tasks and solutions:

TASK: You need to schedule a meeting for Raymond, Billy and Donald for half an hour between the work hours of 9:00 to 17:00 on Monday. 

Here are the existing schedules for everyone during the day: 
Raymond has blocked their calendar on Monday during 9:00 to 9:30, 11:30 to 12:00, 13:00 to 13:30, 15:00 to 15:30; 
Billy has meetings on Monday during 10:00 to 10:30, 12:00 to 13:00, 16:30 to 17:00; 
Donald has meetings on Monday during 9:00 to 9:30, 10:00 to 11:00, 12:00 to 13:00, 14:00 to 14:30, 16:00 to 17:00; 

Billy would like to avoid more meetings on Monday after 15:00. Find a time that works for everyone's schedule and constraints.
