Step 1 — Anna schedules the meeting
- Action executed: schedule-by-anna meeting1 at t11
- Human-readable: Anna schedules "meeting1" to start at 11:00 on Monday.
- Timestamp and duration: starts at 11:00, duration 60 minutes (11:00–12:00), within the permitted window 09:00–17:00.
- Preconditions that were satisfied before this step:
  - The meeting was unscheduled.
  - The shared meeting slot was available (meeting-free).
  - t11 (11:00) is within the allowed window.
  - All participants were free at 11:00: dylan, kathryn, hannah, and anna had free_hour at t11.
- Effects of the action:
  - The meeting is now scheduled globally (meeting-scheduled-global).
  - meeting1 is recorded as scheduled at 11:00.
  - All four participants attend the meeting (attends dylan/kathryn/hannah/anna meeting1).
  - The meeting is no longer unscheduled and the shared meeting slot is no longer free.
  - The 11:00 free_hour slot is consumed for each participant.
- Result: The final goal is achieved — a one-hour meeting on Monday between 09:00 and 17:00 has been scheduled at 11:00 with all participants attending.
