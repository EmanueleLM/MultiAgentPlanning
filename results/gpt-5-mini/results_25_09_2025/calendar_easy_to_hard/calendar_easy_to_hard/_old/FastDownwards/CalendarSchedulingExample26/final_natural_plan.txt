Summary: The three agents together schedule a one-hour meeting on Monday from 15:30 to 16:30 (slots s13 + s14). The plan has three steps (cost = 3).

Step 1 — Agent: Kevin (schedule_a3)
- Action: Kevin records a meeting start at slot s13 (s13 → s14 consecutive).
- Time: start = 15:30, occupies s13 (15:30–16:00) and s14 (16:00–16:30); total meeting duration = 60 minutes.
- Preconditions satisfied: Kevin allowed s13 as a valid meeting start (private constraint).
- Effects: Kevin marks the meeting as scheduled from s13; the start-allowed s13 flag is consumed (no other conflicting start will be allowed by Kevin).

Step 2 — Agent: Katherine (schedule_a1)
- Action: Katherine schedules meeting1 for Nicole starting at s13 (using slots s13 and s14).
- Time: start = 15:30, occupies 15:30–16:30 (s13 + s14).
- Preconditions satisfied: Katherine sees Nicole is free at s13 and s14, and s13 and s14 are consecutive.
- Effects: Katherine records the meeting for meeting1 at start slot s13 (meeting_at_a1 meeting1 s13) and marks her agent-level scheduling flag as done; Nicole’s free marks for s13 and s14 are consumed (those half-hour slots now taken for Nicole).

Step 3 — Agent: Nicole (schedule_a2)
- Action: Nicole schedules meeting1 for Katherine starting at s13 (using slots s13 and s14).
- Time: start = 15:30, occupies 15:30–16:30 (s13 + s14).
- Preconditions satisfied: Nicole sees Katherine is free at s13 and s14, s13 and s14 are within work hours, and they are consecutive.
- Effects: Nicole records the meeting start at s13 (scheduled_a2 meeting1 s13 and meeting_scheduled_a2 flag); Katherine’s free marks for s13 and s14 are consumed.

Final state / Goal achieved:
- All required agent flags are set: Kevin (scheduled_a3 meeting1 s13), Katherine (scheduled_a1 and meeting_at_a1 meeting1 s13), Nicole (scheduled_a2 meeting1 s13).
- The meeting is scheduled for Monday 15:30–16:30 and is compatible with all participants’ calendars (Kevin’s allowed start, Katherine and Nicole were free).
