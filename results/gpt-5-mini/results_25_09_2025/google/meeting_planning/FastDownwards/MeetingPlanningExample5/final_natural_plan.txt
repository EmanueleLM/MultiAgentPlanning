1) Start the meeting at The Castro at t195 (12:15).  
   - Participants: visitor and William (both at The Castro from t195 through t269).  
   - William is available for the entire interval t195–t269 (his stated availability begins at 12:15).  
   - Duration: 75 minutes (t195 through t269 inclusive) — from 12:15 until 13:30.  
   - Result: meeting scheduled (goal achieved).

Note: Given the visitor starts the day at Nob Hill at 09:00 and travel time Nob Hill→The Castro is 17 minutes, the visitor must depart Nob Hill by 11:58 to arrive at The Castro by 12:15, so the 75-minute meeting can begin on time.
