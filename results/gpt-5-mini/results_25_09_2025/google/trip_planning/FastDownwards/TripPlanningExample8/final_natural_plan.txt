Here are the human-readable steps that correspond exactly to the provided plan, with the time ranges used by the PDDL actions and the direct flights indicated.

1) Stay in Krakow — 6 days (days 8 through 13)
   - Starting location: Krakow (initial state).
   - Occupied days: day8, day9, day10, day11, day12, day13.
   - Effect: Krakow is marked visited and those days are reserved.

2) Fly (direct) from Krakow to Zurich
   - Travel action: Krakow → Zurich (direct flight).
   - Instantaneous travel action in the plan (no day range specified).

3) Stay in Zurich — 5 days (days 14 through 18)
   - Location: Zurich.
   - Occupied days: day14, day15, day16, day17, day18.
   - Effect: Zurich is marked visited and those days are reserved.

4) Fly (direct) from Zurich to Athens
   - Travel action: Zurich → Athens (direct flight).
   - Instantaneous travel action in the plan.

5) Stay in Athens — 7 days (days 1 through 7)
   - Location: Athens.
   - Occupied days: day1, day2, day3, day4, day5, day6, day7.
   - Effect: Athens is marked visited and those days are reserved.

6) Visit relatives in Athens
   - Action performed while at Athens and after Athens is occupied for at least one day in the schedule.
   - Effect: relatives-visited is achieved (the relatives-visit constraint is satisfied during the Athens stay, which falls entirely between day1 and day7).

Final state achieved by these steps:
- All three cities visited: Krakow, Zurich, Athens.
- All specified stays occupied:
  - Krakow: 6 days (day8–day13)
  - Zurich: 5 days (day14–day18)
  - Athens: 7 days (day1–day7)
- Relatives visited in Athens between day1 and day7 (requirement satisfied).
- Only direct flights used for inter-city travel (Krakow↔Zurich and Zurich↔Athens).

Note about total trip length:
- The plan occupies days 1 through 18 (6 + 5 + 7 = 18 days total) following the provided PDDL. This does not match the JSON specification’s stated total trip length of 16 days. The actions above reproduce the given plan exactly; if you require the trip to sum to 16 days, the schedule must be revised.
