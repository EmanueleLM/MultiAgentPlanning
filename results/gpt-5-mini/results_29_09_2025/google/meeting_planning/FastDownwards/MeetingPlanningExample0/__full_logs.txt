PROBLEM
------------------------------
You are visiting San Francisco for the day and want to meet as many friends as possible. Solve the problem by considering various different schedules and picking the best one to optimize your goals.

Travel distances (in minutes):
Marina District to Mission District: 20.
Mission District to Marina District: 19.

CONSTRAINTS: You arrive at Marina District at 9:00AM. Stephanie will be at Mission District from 10:30AM to 1:30PM. You'd like to meet Stephanie for a minimum of 120 minutes.

Your response should start with 'SOLUTION:'.

================================================================================


FINAL-PLAN
------------------------------
Candidate schedule proposals (earliest-first; each proposal respects travel times and Stephanie's availability 10:30–13:30 and the hard requirement: meeting >= 120 minutes)

Notes on time encoding used below: times in 24h HH:MM. Travel durations: Marina -> Mission = 20 minutes; Mission -> Marina = 19 minutes. Earliest possible meeting start that satisfies Stephanie and travel is 10:30. Latest meeting start that still allows 120 continuous minutes inside Stephanie's window is 11:30.

Proposal 1 — Earliest feasible meeting (preferred)
- Travel leg (single): depart Marina District 10:10 -> arrive Mission District 10:30 (travel 20 min)
- Meeting with Stephanie: start 10:30 -> end 12:30 (meeting 120 min)
- Return leg (optional after meeting): depart Mission District 12:30 -> arrive Marina District 12:49 (travel 19 min)
- 120-minute minimum satisfied: YES

Proposal 2 — Arrive earlier and wait (arrive early, same earliest meeting)
- Travel leg: depart Marina District 09:40 -> arrive Mission District 10:00 (travel 20 min)
- Wait at Mission District until 10:30
- Meeting with Stephanie: start 10:30 -> end 12:30 (meeting 120 min)
- Return leg: depart Mission District 12:30 -> arrive Marina District 12:49 (travel 19 min)
- 120-minute minimum satisfied: YES

Proposal 3 — Middle-of-window meeting (still satisfies minimum)
- Travel leg: depart Marina District 10:10 -> arrive Mission District 10:30
- Meeting with Stephanie: start 11:00 -> end 13:00 (meeting 120 min)
- Return leg: depart Mission District 13:00 -> arrive Marina District 13:19
- 120-minute minimum satisfied: YES

Proposal 4 — Latest feasible contiguous meeting (meets boundary constraint)
- Travel leg: depart Marina District 11:10 -> arrive Mission District 11:30 (travel 20 min)
- Meeting with Stephanie: start 11:30 -> end 13:30 (meeting 120 min)
- Return leg: depart Mission District 13:30 -> arrive Marina District 13:49
- 120-minute minimum satisfied: YES

Proposal 5 — If you prefer minimal waiting and earliest meeting, depart later to arrive exactly at meeting start
- Travel leg: depart Marina District 10:10 -> arrive Mission District 10:30
- Meeting with Stephanie: start 10:30 -> end 12:30
- 120-minute minimum satisfied: YES

Summary guidance:
- Earliest possible meeting start within all hard constraints is 10:30. Proposals 1/2/5 realize that earliest start.
- Any meeting start must satisfy: start >= 10:30 and start <= 11:30 (so the meeting can last 120 min within Stephanie’s 10:30–13:30 availability).
- If you want to minimize waiting at Mission, depart Marina at 10:10 (arrive 10:30).
- If you prefer to be on-site ready earlier (to accommodate multi-person meets or errands), depart earlier (e.g., 09:40 -> arrive 10:00).

PDDL files for use with FastDownward
- The domain encodes: locations, numeric time (minutes since midnight), travel actions that increase time by their durations, a meeting action that requires traveler at Mission and the meeting start to be within Stephanie's window (10:30–11:30 start window = 630–690 minutes) and increases time by 120 (meeting duration).
- The problem starts time at 09:00 (540 minutes) and requires that traveler meets Stephanie (a single boolean goal).
- The meeting action enforces the hard constraint that meeting start must be between 630 and 690 inclusive (ensuring meeting finishes by 13:30 = 810).
- The domain and problem below are prepared to be run with FastDownward (classical+numeric features). If your planner reports unsupported requirements, remove/adjust numeric equality/inequality support accordingly.

NATURAL-PLAN sas_plan_5
------------------------------
1) Travel from Marina District to Mission District  
   - Action: travel-marina-to-mission (t540 -> t560)  
   - Depart: 09:00 (t540)  
   - Arrive: 09:20 (t560)  
   - Duration: 20 minutes

2) Travel from Mission District back to Marina District  
   - Action: travel-mission-to-marina (t560 -> t579)  
   - Depart: 09:20 (t560)  
   - Arrive: 09:39 (t579)  
   - Duration: 19 minutes

3) Travel from Marina District to Mission District again  
   - Action: travel-marina-to-mission (t579 -> t599)  
   - Depart: 09:39 (t579)  
   - Arrive: 09:59 (t599)  
   - Duration: 20 minutes

4) Travel from Mission District back to Marina District again  
   - Action: travel-mission-to-marina (t599 -> t618)  
   - Depart: 09:59 (t599)  
   - Arrive: 10:18 (t618)  
   - Duration: 19 minutes

5) Travel from Marina District to Mission District (final approach)  
   - Action: travel-marina-to-mission (t618 -> t638)  
   - Depart: 10:18 (t618)  
   - Arrive: 10:38 (t638)  
   - Duration: 20 minutes

6) Meet Stephanie at Mission District for the required 120 minutes  
   - Action: meet-stephanie (t638 -> t758)  
   - Start meeting: 10:38 (t638) — this is within Stephanie’s availability window (10:30–13:30)  
   - End meeting: 12:38 (t758)  
   - Duration: 120 minutes  
   - Result: traveler has met Stephanie (goal satisfied)

Final note: All steps follow the given travel times (20 minutes Marina→Mission, 19 minutes Mission→Marina) and the meeting meets the minimum 120-minute requirement within Stephanie’s 10:30–13:30 availability.
