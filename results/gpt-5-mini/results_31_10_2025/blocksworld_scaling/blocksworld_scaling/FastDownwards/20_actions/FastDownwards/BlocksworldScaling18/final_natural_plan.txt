Below is a clear, step-by-step human-readable rendition of the provided plan. Each step matches the plan exactly (no actions added or removed). I include a simple timestamp and a 1s duration for each action (timestamps are incremental and purely illustrative).

1. Time 00:00:01 (duration 1s) — vowel_actor: move E from C to the table.  
2. Time 00:00:02 (duration 1s) — consonant_actor: move C from H to E.  
3. Time 00:00:03 (duration 1s) — consonant_actor: move G from B to H.  
4. Time 00:00:04 (duration 1s) — consonant_actor: move B from J to C.  
5. Time 00:00:05 (duration 1s) — consonant_actor: move J from A to G.  
6. Time 00:00:06 (duration 1s) — vowel_actor: move A from K to B.  
7. Time 00:00:07 (duration 1s) — consonant_actor: move J from G to K.  
8. Time 00:00:08 (duration 1s) — consonant_actor: move G from H to A.  
9. Time 00:00:09 (duration 1s) — consonant_actor: move H from I to G.  
10. Time 00:00:10 (duration 1s) — vowel_actor: move I from D to J.  
11. Time 00:00:11 (duration 1s) — consonant_actor: move H from G to I.  
12. Time 00:00:12 (duration 1s) — consonant_actor: move G from A to H.  
13. Time 00:00:13 (duration 1s) — consonant_actor: move D from F to A.  
14. Time 00:00:14 (duration 1s) — consonant_actor: move F from the table to G.  
15. Time 00:00:15 (duration 1s) — consonant_actor: move D from A to the table.  
16. Time 00:00:16 (duration 1s) — vowel_actor: move A from B to the table.  
17. Time 00:00:17 (duration 1s) — consonant_actor: move B from C to A.  
18. Time 00:00:18 (duration 1s) — consonant_actor: move C from E to D.  
19. Time 00:00:19 (duration 1s) — consonant_actor: move B from A to C.  
20. Time 00:00:20 (duration 1s) — vowel_actor: move E from the table to F.  
21. Time 00:00:21 (duration 1s) — consonant_actor: move B from C to the table.  
22. Time 00:00:22 (duration 1s) — consonant_actor: move C from D to A.  
23. Time 00:00:23 (duration 1s) — consonant_actor: move D from the table to E.  
24. Time 00:00:24 (duration 1s) — consonant_actor: move C from A to D.  
25. Time 00:00:25 (duration 1s) — consonant_actor: move B from the table to C.  
26. Time 00:00:26 (duration 1s) — vowel_actor: move A from the table to B.

Summary: After these 26 actions (total cost = 26, unit cost per action), the plan achieves the goal single stack with K on the table and the chain J on K, I on J, H on I, G on H, F on G, E on F, D on E, C on D, B on C, A on B (A is the top).
