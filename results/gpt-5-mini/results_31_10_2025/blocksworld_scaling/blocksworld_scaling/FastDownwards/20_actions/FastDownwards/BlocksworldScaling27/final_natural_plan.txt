Final status (after Step 29)
- The goal configuration is achieved: top-to-bottom ordering A on B, B on C, C on D, D on E, E on F, F on G, G on H, H on I, I on J, J on K, with K on the table.
- Total plan cost reported in the original plan: 29 (unit cost).

If you want, I can also render these steps as a timeline graphic, verify stack snapshots after each step, or produce them in CSV/JSON form.
