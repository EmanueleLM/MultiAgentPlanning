Below is a step-by-step, human-readable rendering of the provided PDDL plan. Each step shows a timestamp (start time in seconds), a 1.0s duration for the action, the agent who performs it (consonant_agent or vowel_agent), and a concise description of the move. Block labels are shown in uppercase (A–L) to match the specification.

Total steps: 37. Total cost reported by the plan: 37 (unit cost).
