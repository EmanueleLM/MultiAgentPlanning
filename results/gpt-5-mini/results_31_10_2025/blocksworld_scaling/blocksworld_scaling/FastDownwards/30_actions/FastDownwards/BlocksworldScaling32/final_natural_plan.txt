Notes:
- Each action is presented exactly in the order of the provided PDDL plan and labeled with the agent implied by the action name prefix.  
- Descriptions use the action parameter ordering from the domain: for "*-from-block-onto (?x ?y ?z)" we say "move ?x (on ?y) onto ?z"; for "from-table-onto (?x ?z)" we say "move ?x (from table) onto ?z"; for "from-block-to-table (?x ?y)" we say "move ?x (on ?y) to the table."  
- All steps assume the usual blocksworld preconditions (the moved block is clear/top, the destination is clear, and the block being moved matches the agent's vowel/consonant capability).
