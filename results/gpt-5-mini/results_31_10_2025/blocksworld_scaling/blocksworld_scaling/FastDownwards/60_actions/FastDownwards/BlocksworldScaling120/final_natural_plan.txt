Summary: the following 37 steps are a direct, human-readable transcription of the provided PDDL plan. Each line lists the acting agent, the action in plain language, the source and destination, a start timestamp, and the action duration (10s each). Total steps: 37. Total duration: 370s. Total cost (as in plan): 37. The sequence is intended to achieve the final stack bottom-to-top: K J I H G F E D C B A (K on table t1).
