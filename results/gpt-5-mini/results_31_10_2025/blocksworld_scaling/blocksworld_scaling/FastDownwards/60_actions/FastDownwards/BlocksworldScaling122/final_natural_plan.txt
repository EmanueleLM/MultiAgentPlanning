Below is a human-readable, step-by-step execution of the provided plan. Each step lists the acting agent, the block moved, the source and destination, a timestamp (step number) and a duration (1 time unit). I follow the plan exactly and do not add or remove actions.

1) t=1, duration=1 — consonant_agent: pick up D from on J and place D on the table.
2) t=2, duration=1 — consonant_agent: pick up J from on F and place J on top of K.
3) t=3, duration=1 — consonant_agent: pick up F from on E and place F on the table.
4) t=4, duration=1 — consonant_agent: pick up N from on B and place N on the table.
5) t=5, duration=1 — consonant_agent: pick up B from on A and place B on the table.
6) t=6, duration=1 — consonant_agent: pick up J from on K and place J on the table.
7) t=7, duration=1 — consonant_agent: pick up K from on H and place K on the table.
8) t=8, duration=1 — consonant_agent: pick up H from on M and place H on the table.
9) t=9, duration=1 — consonant_agent: pick up M from on C and place M on top of N.
10) t=10, duration=1 — consonant_agent: pick up C from on G and place C on top of D.
11) t=11, duration=1 — consonant_agent: pick up B from the table and place B on top of C.
12) t=12, duration=1 — vowel_agent: pick up A from the table and place A on top of B.
13) t=13, duration=1 — consonant_agent: pick up G from on I and place G on top of H.
14) t=14, duration=1 — consonant_agent: pick up F from the table and place F on top of G.
15) t=15, duration=1 — vowel_agent: pick up E from the table and place E on top of F.
16) t=16, duration=1 — vowel_agent: pick up I from on L and place I on top of J.
17) t=17, duration=1 — consonant_agent: pick up L from the table and place L on top of M.
18) t=18, duration=1 — consonant_agent: pick up K from the table and place K on top of L.
19) t=19, duration=1 — vowel_agent: pick up I from on J and place I on the table.
20) t=20, duration=1 — consonant_agent: pick up J from the table and place J on top of K.
21) t=21, duration=1 — vowel_agent: pick up I from the table and place I on top of J.
22) t=22, duration=1 — vowel_agent: pick up E from the table and place E on top of F.
23) t=23, duration=1 — consonant_agent: pick up F from on G and place F on the table.
24) t=24, duration=1 — vowel_agent: pick up E from the table and place E on top of F.
25) t=25, duration=1 — consonant_agent: pick up G from on H and place G on the table.
26) t=26, duration=1 — consonant_agent: pick up H from the table and place H on top of I.
27) t=27, duration=1 — consonant_agent: pick up G from the table and place G on top of H.
28) t=28, duration=1 — vowel_agent: pick up E from on F and place E on the table.
29) t=29, duration=1 — consonant_agent: pick up F from the table and place F on top of G.
30) t=30, duration=1 — vowel_agent: pick up E from the table and place E on top of F.
31) t=31, duration=1 — vowel_agent: execute action "move-vowel-from-block-to-block a b" — move block A from its current support onto block B (as written in the plan).
32) t=32, duration=1 — consonant_agent: pick up B from on C and place B on the table.
33) t=33, duration=1 — vowel_agent: pick up A from the table and place A on top of B.
34) t=34, duration=1 — consonant_agent: pick up C from the table and place C on top of D.
35) t=35, duration=1 — consonant_agent: pick up D from the table and place D on top of E.
36) t=36, duration=1 — consonant_agent: pick up C from the table and place C on top of D.
37) t=37, duration=1 — vowel_agent: pick up A from on B and place A on the table.
38) t=38, duration=1 — consonant_agent: pick up B from the table and place B on top of C.
39) t=39, duration=1 — vowel_agent: pick up A from the table and place A on top of B.

Final note: the sequence above follows the plan exactly (39 actions, unit duration each). After executing these steps the plan reaches the stated goal (a single tower with A on B, B on C, C on D, D on E, E on F, F on G, G on H, H on I, I on J, J on K, K on L, L on M, M on N, and N on the table).
