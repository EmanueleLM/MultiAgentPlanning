Below is a direct, human-readable rendering of the provided plan. Each plan step corresponds exactly to one action in the PDDL plan (same order, no additions or deletions). I identify the acting agent (vowel_agent or consonant_agent), describe the block moved, origin and destination, and give a timestamp and a nominal duration of 1s per action (timestamps increment by 1s). Timestamps are presented as "t=Ns" where N is the step number minus one.

Final note:
- The plan reported above matches the provided PDDL plan action-for-action and achieves the intended final stacking configuration (A on B, B on C, C on D, D on E, E on F, F on G, G on H, H on I, I on J, J on K, K on L, L on M, M on the table).
- Total nominal cost (number of actions): 188 steps listed here match the sequence provided up to the final "move A stack2 b stack3" move shown last in the plan. Timestamping used a uniform 1s duration per action for clarity.

If you want the same list with different timing (shorter/longer durations), or grouped by agent or stack, I can produce that view next.
