Below is a clear, step-by-step, human-readable execution of the provided PDDL plan. Each step matches exactly one action in the plan, in the same order, and includes a timestamp (1 time unit per action).

Step 1 (t=0 → 1, duration 1):
agent_1 moves disk A from on top of disk B (left peg) to the middle peg.

Step 2 (t=1 → 2, duration 1):
agent_1 moves disk B from on top of disk C (left peg) to the right peg.

Step 3 (t=2 → 3, duration 1):
agent_1 moves disk A from the middle peg to on top of disk C (left peg).

Step 4 (t=3 → 4, duration 1):
agent_1 moves disk B from the right peg to the middle peg.

Step 5 (t=4 → 5, duration 1):
agent_1 moves disk A from on top of disk C (left peg) to on top of disk B (middle peg).

Step 6 (t=5 → 6, duration 1):
agent_1 moves disk C from on top of disk D (left peg) to the right peg.

Step 7 (t=6 → 7, duration 1):
agent_1 moves disk A from on top of disk B (middle peg) to on top of disk D (left peg).

Step 8 (t=7 → 8, duration 1):
agent_1 moves disk B from the middle peg to on top of disk C (right peg).

Step 9 (t=8 → 9, duration 1):
agent_1 moves disk A from on top of disk D (left peg) to on top of disk B (right peg).

Step 10 (t=9 → 10, duration 1):
agent_1 moves disk D from on top of disk E (left peg) to the middle peg.

Step 11 (t=10 → 11, duration 1):
agent_1 moves disk A from on top of disk B (right peg) to on top of disk E (left peg).

Step 12 (t=11 → 12, duration 1):
agent_1 moves disk B from on top of disk C (right peg) to on top of disk D (middle peg).

Step 13 (t=12 → 13, duration 1):
agent_1 moves disk A from on top of disk E (left peg) to on top of disk C (right peg).

Final configuration (after t=13):
- Left peg top→bottom: E, F, G, H, I, J
- Middle peg top→bottom: B, D
- Right peg top→bottom: A, C

This sequence matches the provided plan exactly (13 moves, performed by agent_1 on disks A–E) and achieves the specified global goal.
