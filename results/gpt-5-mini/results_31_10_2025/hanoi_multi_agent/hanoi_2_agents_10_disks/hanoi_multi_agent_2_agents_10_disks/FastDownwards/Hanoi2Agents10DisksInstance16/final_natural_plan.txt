Plan name: Hanoi2Agents10DisksInstance16 — human-readable execution of the given plan (3 steps). Timestamps/durations are illustrative and indicate ordering; they do not change the actions.

Step 1 — [00:00 → 00:05] (duration 5s)
Original plan action: (agent1-move-from-disk-to-empty-peg a b left right)
Human-readable: agent_1: move disk A from left to right.
Notes: Disk A is the top disk on the left peg. The right peg is empty; moving A to right is legal and permitted for agent_1.

Step 2 — [00:05 → 00:10] (duration 5s)
Original plan action: (agent1-move-from-disk-to-empty-peg b c left middle)
Human-readable: agent_1: move disk B from left to middle.
Notes: After Step 1, B becomes the top disk on the left peg and the middle peg is empty; agent_1 is permitted to move B.

Step 3 — [00:10 → 00:15] (duration 5s)
Original plan action: (agent1-move-from-peg-to-disk a right b middle)
Human-readable: agent_1: move disk A from right to middle, placing it on top of disk B.
Notes: Disk A (on right) is smaller than B (on middle), so placing A on B is legal and agent_1 is permitted to perform this move.

Final verification (after Step 3):
- Middle peg (top → bottom): A, B
- Left peg (top → bottom): C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J
- Right peg: empty

These three actions, executed in order by agent_1, produce the required final configuration and respect the Tower of Hanoi rules and the agents' disk permissions.
