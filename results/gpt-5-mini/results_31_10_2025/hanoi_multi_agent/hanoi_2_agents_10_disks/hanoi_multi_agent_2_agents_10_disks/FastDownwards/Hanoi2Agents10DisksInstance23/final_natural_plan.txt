Start time 00:00:00. Each step below is 1s long (timestamps increment by 1s). All moves are performed by agent_1 and follow the given plan exactly.

1) 00:00:01 — agent_1: move disk A from left to middle.
   (A was on top of B on the left peg; moved A to the middle peg.)

2) 00:00:02 — agent_1: move disk B from left to right.
   (B was now the top disk on the left peg; moved B to the right peg.)

3) 00:00:03 — agent_1: move disk A from middle to left.
   (Moved A from the middle peg onto disk C on the left peg.)

4) 00:00:04 — agent_1: move disk B from right to middle.
   (Moved B from the right peg to the middle peg.)

5) 00:00:05 — agent_1: move disk A from left to middle.
   (Moved A from on top of C (left peg) onto B (middle peg).)

6) 00:00:06 — agent_1: move disk C from left to right.
   (Moved C from on top of D (left peg) to the right peg.)

7) 00:00:07 — agent_1: move disk A from middle to left.
   (Moved A from on top of B (middle peg) onto D (left peg).)

8) 00:00:08 — agent_1: move disk B from middle to right.
   (Moved B from the middle peg onto disk C on the right peg.)

9) 00:00:09 — agent_1: move disk A from left to right.
   (Moved A from on top of D (left peg) onto B (right peg).)

10) 00:00:10 — agent_1: move disk D from left to middle.
    (Moved D from on top of E (left peg) to the middle peg.)

11) 00:00:11 — agent_1: move disk A from right to left.
    (Moved A from on top of B (right peg) onto E (left peg).)

12) 00:00:12 — agent_1: move disk B from right to middle.
    (Moved B from on top of C (right peg) onto D (middle peg).)

13) 00:00:13 — agent_1: move disk A from left to right.
    (Moved A from on top of E (left peg) onto C (right peg).)

14) 00:00:14 — agent_1: move disk B from middle to left.
    (Moved B from on top of D (middle peg) onto E (left peg).)

End time 00:00:14. Total cost/time: 14 actions / 14 seconds.  
Final configuration matches the goal: left (top→bottom) B, E, F, G, H, I, J; middle has D; right (top→bottom) A, C.
