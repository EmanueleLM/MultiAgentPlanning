Step 1 [t=0s → 1s]: agent_1: move disk A from on top of disk B (left peg) to the middle peg.

Step 2 [t=1s → 2s]: agent_1: move disk B from on top of disk C (left peg) to the right peg.

Step 3 [t=2s → 3s]: agent_1: move disk A from the middle peg to on top of disk B (right peg).

Step 4 [t=3s → 4s]: agent_1: move disk C from on top of disk D (left peg) to the middle peg.

Step 5 [t=4s → 5s]: agent_1: move disk A from on top of disk B (right peg) to on top of disk D (left peg).

Step 6 [t=5s → 6s]: agent_1: move disk B from the right peg to on top of disk C (middle peg).

Step 7 [t=6s → 7s]: agent_1: move disk A from on top of disk D (left peg) to on top of disk B (middle peg).

Summary:
- Total steps: 7 (unit duration assumed per step; total time ≈ 7s).
- Plan cost: 7 (unit cost per move).
- Final configuration achieved: left peg (top→bottom) D, E, F, G, H, I, J; middle peg (top→bottom) A, B, C; right peg empty.
