Summary: 13 ordered primitive moves (all executed by agent_1). Each move duration = 1 time unit. Plan cost = 13. Timeline starts at t=0 and advances by 1.0 per step.

1) t=0.0 → 1.0 (duration 1.0)
   agent_1: move disk A from on top of disk B to peg middle.

2) t=1.0 → 2.0 (duration 1.0)
   agent_1: move disk B from on top of disk C to peg right.

3) t=2.0 → 3.0 (duration 1.0)
   agent_1: move disk A from peg middle to on top of disk C.

4) t=3.0 → 4.0 (duration 1.0)
   agent_1: move disk A from on top of disk C to on top of disk B.

5) t=4.0 → 5.0 (duration 1.0)
   agent_1: move disk C from on top of disk D to peg middle.

6) t=5.0 → 6.0 (duration 1.0)
   agent_1: move disk A from on top of disk B to on top of disk C.

7) t=6.0 → 7.0 (duration 1.0)
   agent_1: move disk A from on top of disk C to on top of disk D.

8) t=7.0 → 8.0 (duration 1.0)
   agent_1: move disk B from peg right to on top of disk C.

9) t=8.0 → 9.0 (duration 1.0)
   agent_1: move disk A from on top of disk D to on top of disk B.

10) t=9.0 → 10.0 (duration 1.0)
    agent_1: move disk D from on top of disk E to peg right.

11) t=10.0 → 11.0 (duration 1.0)
    agent_1: move disk A from on top of disk B to on top of disk D.

12) t=11.0 → 12.0 (duration 1.0)
    agent_1: move disk B from on top of disk C to on top of disk E.

13) t=12.0 → 13.0 (duration 1.0)
    agent_1: move disk A from on top of disk D to on top of disk C.

End time: t=13.0. Total moves: 13 (cost = 13).
