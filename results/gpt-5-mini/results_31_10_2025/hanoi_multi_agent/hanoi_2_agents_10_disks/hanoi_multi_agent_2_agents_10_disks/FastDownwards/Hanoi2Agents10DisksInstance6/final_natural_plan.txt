Below is a human-readable, step-by-step rendering of the provided PDDL plan. Each step corresponds exactly to one action in the plan (no additions or deletions). I include a timestamp (start at 00:00:00) and a duration of 1s for each primitive move.

1. [00:00:00 → 00:00:01] agent_1: move disk A from on top of disk B to peg middle.
2. [00:00:01 → 00:00:02] agent_1: move disk B from on top of disk C to peg right.
3. [00:00:02 → 00:00:03] agent_1: move disk A from peg middle to on top of disk C.
4. [00:00:03 → 00:00:04] agent_1: move disk A from on top of disk C to on top of disk B.
5. [00:00:04 → 00:00:05] agent_1: move disk C from on top of disk D to peg middle.
6. [00:00:05 → 00:00:06] agent_1: move disk A from on top of disk B to on top of disk D.
7. [00:00:06 → 00:00:07] agent_1: move disk B from peg right to on top of disk C.
8. [00:00:07 → 00:00:08] agent_1: move disk A from on top of disk D to on top of disk B.
9. [00:00:08 → 00:00:09] agent_1: move disk D from on top of disk E to peg right.
10. [00:00:09 → 00:00:10] agent_1: move disk A from on top of disk B to on top of disk D.
11. [00:00:10 → 00:00:11] agent_1: move disk B from on top of disk C to on top of disk E.
12. [00:00:11 → 00:00:12] agent_1: move disk A from on top of disk D to on top of disk B.
13. [00:00:12 → 00:00:13] agent_1: move disk C from peg middle to on top of disk D.
14. [00:00:13 → 00:00:14] agent_1: move disk A from on top of disk B to peg middle.
15. [00:00:14 → 00:00:15] agent_1: move disk A from peg middle to on top of disk C.
16. [00:00:15 → 00:00:16] agent_1: move disk B from on top of disk E to peg middle.
17. [00:00:16 → 00:00:17] agent_1: move disk A from on top of disk C to on top of disk B.
18. [00:00:17 → 00:00:18] agent_1: move disk C from on top of disk D to on top of disk E.
19. [00:00:18 → 00:00:19] agent_1: move disk A from on top of disk B to on top of disk D.

Total primitive moves: 19 (each shown above). All moves are performed by agent_1 and involve only disks A–E, matching the provided plan exactly.
