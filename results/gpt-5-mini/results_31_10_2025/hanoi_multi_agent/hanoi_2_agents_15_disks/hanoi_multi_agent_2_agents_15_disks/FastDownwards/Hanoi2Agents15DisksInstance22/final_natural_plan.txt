1) Step 1 — t = 0s (duration ≈ 1s):
   agent_1 moves disk A from on top of disk B to the middle peg.
   (corresponds to: (agent1-move-to-peg a b middle))

2) Step 2 — t = 1s (duration ≈ 1s):
   agent_1 moves disk B from on top of disk C to the right peg.
   (corresponds to: (agent1-move-to-peg b c right))

3) Step 3 — t = 2s (duration ≈ 1s):
   agent_1 moves disk A from the middle peg onto disk B.
   (corresponds to: (agent1-move-to-disk a middle b))

4) Step 4 — t = 3s (duration ≈ 1s):
   agent_1 moves disk C from on top of disk D to the middle peg.
   (corresponds to: (agent1-move-to-peg c d middle))

5) Step 5 — t = 4s (duration ≈ 1s):
   agent_1 moves disk A from on top of disk B onto disk C.
   (corresponds to: (agent1-move-to-disk a b c))

6) Step 6 — t = 5s (duration ≈ 1s):
   agent_1 moves disk B from the right peg onto disk D.
   (corresponds to: (agent1-move-to-disk b right d))

7) Step 7 — t = 6s (duration ≈ 1s):
   agent_1 moves disk A from on top of disk C onto disk B.
   (corresponds to: (agent1-move-to-disk a c b))

8) Step 8 — t = 7s (duration ≈ 1s):
   agent_1 moves disk C from the middle peg to the right peg (placing C alone on the right).
   (corresponds to: (agent1-move-to-peg c middle right))

Result:
- All moves were performed by agent_1 (allowed disks A..H).
- Final achieved configuration (as required): right peg has disk C alone on top; left peg has A and B on top of D (and the remaining larger disks below) with the middle peg empty.
- Plan cost: 8 (unit cost).
