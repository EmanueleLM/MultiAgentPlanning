Plan summary (3 steps, unit cost = 3). Each move is performed by agent_1. Assume each primitive move takes 1.0 time unit.

Step 1 — time 0.0 → 1.0
agent_1: move disk A from left to middle

Step 2 — time 1.0 → 2.0
agent_1: move disk B from left to right

Step 3 — time 2.0 → 3.0
agent_1: move disk A from middle to right

Result: after these three moves the configuration matches the goal: left peg top is C (stack C–D–E–...–O), middle peg is empty (baseM top), and right peg has A on top of B.
