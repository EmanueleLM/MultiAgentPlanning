Step 1 — time 00:00:00 (duration ~1s):
agent_1: move disk A from left to middle

Explanation: Disk A (the topmost disk on the left peg, sitting on disk B) is moved by agent_1 to the middle peg. This single move matches the PDDL action (move-agent_1-disk-to-peg a b middle), respects the permission that agent_1 may move A–J, and maintains the Tower of Hanoi rules (moving only a top disk and not placing a larger disk on a smaller one).
