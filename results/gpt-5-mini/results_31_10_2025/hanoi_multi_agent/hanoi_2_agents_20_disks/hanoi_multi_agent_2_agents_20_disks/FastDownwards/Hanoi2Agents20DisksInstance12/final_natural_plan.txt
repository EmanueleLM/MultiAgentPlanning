1) [00:00:00 → 00:00:01; duration 1s] agent_1: move disk A from on top of disk B (left peg) to right peg.

2) [00:00:01 → 00:00:02; duration 1s] agent_1: move disk B from on top of disk C (left peg) to middle peg.

3) [00:00:02 → 00:00:03; duration 1s] agent_1: move disk A from right peg onto disk C (disk C is now clear).

4) [00:00:03 → 00:00:04; duration 1s] agent_1: move disk A from on top of disk C to on top of disk B (i.e., place A on B on the middle peg).

5) [00:00:04 → 00:00:05; duration 1s] agent_1: move disk C from on top of disk D (left peg) to right peg.

6) [00:00:05 → 00:00:06; duration 1s] agent_1: move disk A from on top of disk B to on top of disk C.
