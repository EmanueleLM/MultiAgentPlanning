1) [00:00:00 → 00:00:05] agent_1: Move disk A from on top of disk B (left peg) to the right peg.
2) [00:00:05 → 00:00:10] agent_1: Move disk B from on top of disk C (left peg) to the middle peg.
3) [00:00:10 → 00:00:15] agent_1: Move disk A from the right peg to on top of disk B (now on the middle peg).
4) [00:00:15 → 00:00:20] agent_1: Move disk C from on top of disk D (left peg) to the right peg.
5) [00:00:20 → 00:00:25] agent_1: Move disk A from on top of disk B to on top of disk C.
6) [00:00:25 → 00:00:30] agent_1: Move disk B from the middle peg to on top of disk D.
7) [00:00:30 → 00:00:35] agent_1: Move disk A from on top of disk C to on top of disk B.
8) [00:00:35 → 00:00:40] agent_1: Move disk C from the right peg to the middle peg.

Result check: after these 8 moves disk C is on the middle peg and clear, the right peg is empty, and the stack relationships among A, B, D, … match the specified goal. All moves are performed by agent_1 (authorized for disks A–J) and each step obeys the Tower of Hanoi constraints (one disk moved at a time; never placing a larger disk on a smaller disk).
