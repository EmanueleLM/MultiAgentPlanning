1) [t=00:00:00, duration 1s] agent_1: move disk A from left to middle.
   - Reasoning: A (top of left) is moved to the empty middle peg.

2) [t=00:00:01, duration 1s] agent_1: move disk B from left to right.
   - Reasoning: B (now top of left) is moved to the empty right peg.

3) [t=00:00:02, duration 1s] agent_1: move disk A from middle to right (onto disk B).
   - Reasoning: A (top of middle) is placed on top of B on the right peg (legal since A is smaller than B).

4) [t=00:00:03, duration 1s] agent_1: move disk C from left to middle.
   - Reasoning: C (now top of left) is moved to the now-empty middle peg.

Total plan cost: 4 (unit cost).
Final verification (after these steps): left peg top = D; middle peg top = C; right peg top-to-bottom = A, B — matches the specified goal.
