Here is the human-readable step-by-step execution of the provided plan. Each step exactly matches one action in the plan and is shown with a simple timestamp and a 10-second duration per move.

1) 00:00:00 → 00:00:10 (duration 10s): agent_1: move disk A from left to middle
2) 00:00:10 → 00:00:20 (duration 10s): agent_1: move disk B from left to right
3) 00:00:20 → 00:00:30 (duration 10s): agent_1: move disk A from middle to right
4) 00:00:30 → 00:00:40 (duration 10s): agent_1: move disk C from left to middle
5) 00:00:40 → 00:00:50 (duration 10s): agent_1: move disk A from right to left
6) 00:00:50 → 00:01:00 (duration 10s): agent_1: move disk B from right to middle
7) 00:01:00 → 00:01:10 (duration 10s): agent_1: move disk A from left to middle
8) 00:01:10 → 00:01:20 (duration 10s): agent_1: move disk D from left to right
9) 00:01:20 → 00:01:30 (duration 10s): agent_1: move disk A from middle to right
10) 00:01:30 → 00:01:40 (duration 10s): agent_1: move disk B from middle to left

Total actions: 10. Total nominal execution time: 1 minute 40 seconds.
