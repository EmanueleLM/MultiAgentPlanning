Name mapping (to resolve lowercase/uppercase and peg names):
- Disks: a→A, b→B, c→C, d→D, e→E
- Pegs: pegl → left peg, pegm → middle peg, pegr → right peg
- Agent: agent_1 remains agent_1

Execution assumptions:
- Start time t = 0s.
- Each primitive move is assumed to take 1.0s (unit duration). Timestamps below give the start time of each move.

Ordered list of actions (matches the provided plan exactly, 18 moves):

1. t=0.0s (duration 1.0s) — agent_1: move disk A from on top of disk B (left peg) to the right peg.
2. t=1.0s (duration 1.0s) — agent_1: move disk B from on top of disk C (left peg) to the middle peg.
3. t=2.0s (duration 1.0s) — agent_1: move disk A from the right peg to on top of disk B (now on the middle peg).
4. t=3.0s (duration 1.0s) — agent_1: move disk C from on top of disk D (left peg) to the right peg.
5. t=4.0s (duration 1.0s) — agent_1: move disk A from on top of disk B (middle peg) to on top of disk D.
6. t=5.0s (duration 1.0s) — agent_1: move disk B from the middle peg to on top of disk C (now on the right peg).
7. t=6.0s (duration 1.0s) — agent_1: move disk A from on top of disk D to on top of disk B.
8. t=7.0s (duration 1.0s) — agent_1: move disk D from on top of disk E (left peg) to the middle peg.
9. t=8.0s (duration 1.0s) — agent_1: move disk A from on top of disk B to on top of disk D.
10. t=9.0s (duration 1.0s) — agent_1: move disk B from on top of disk C to on top of disk E.
11. t=10.0s (duration 1.0s) — agent_1: move disk A from on top of disk D to on top of disk B.
12. t=11.0s (duration 1.0s) — agent_1: move disk C from the right peg to on top of disk D.
13. t=12.0s (duration 1.0s) — agent_1: move disk A from on top of disk B to the right peg.
14. t=13.0s (duration 1.0s) — agent_1: move disk A from the right peg to on top of disk C.
15. t=14.0s (duration 1.0s) — agent_1: move disk B from on top of disk E to the right peg.
16. t=15.0s (duration 1.0s) — agent_1: move disk A from on top of disk C to on top of disk B.
17. t=16.0s (duration 1.0s) — agent_1: move disk C from on top of disk D to on top of disk E.
18. t=17.0s (duration 1.0s) — agent_1: move disk A from on top of disk B to on top of disk D.

Total moves: 18. Total assumed elapsed time: 18.0s.

Notes:
- All moves are performed by agent_1 only, and only involve disks A–E as required by the specification. Each move respects the top-of-peg constraint and the size ordering (smaller disk placed on larger disk or empty peg), consistent with the provided PDDL plan.
