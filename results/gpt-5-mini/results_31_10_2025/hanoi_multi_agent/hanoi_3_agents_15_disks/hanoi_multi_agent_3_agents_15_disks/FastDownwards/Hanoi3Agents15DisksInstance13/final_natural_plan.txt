Below is a human-readable, step-by-step rendering of the given PDDL plan. Each step matches exactly one action in the plan (no steps added or removed). I give a simple timestamp and a duration of 1 time unit for each primitive move.

1) t = 0.0 → 1.0 (duration 1.0)
   agent_1: Move disk A from left (A is on top of B) to middle (middle is empty).
   (corresponds to: move-agent-from-disk-to-empty agent_1 a b left middle)

2) t = 1.0 → 2.0 (duration 1.0)
   agent_1: Move disk B from left (B is on top of C) to right (right is empty).
   (corresponds to: move-agent-from-disk-to-empty agent_1 b c left right)

3) t = 2.0 → 3.0 (duration 1.0)
   agent_1: Move disk A from middle (A on peg) to right to sit on disk B (A placed on B).
   (corresponds to: move-agent-from-peg-to-disk agent_1 a middle b right)

4) t = 3.0 → 4.0 (duration 1.0)
   agent_1: Move disk C from left (C is on top of D) to middle (middle is empty after step 3).
   (corresponds to: move-agent-from-disk-to-empty agent_1 c d left middle)

5) t = 4.0 → 5.0 (duration 1.0)
   agent_1: Move disk A from right (A is on top of B) to left to sit on disk D (A placed on D).
   (corresponds to: move-agent-from-disk-to-disk agent_1 a b d right left)

6) t = 5.0 → 6.0 (duration 1.0)
   agent_1: Move disk B from right (B on peg) to middle to sit on disk C (B placed on C).
   (corresponds to: move-agent-from-peg-to-disk agent_1 b right c middle)

7) t = 6.0 → 7.0 (duration 1.0)
   agent_1: Move disk A from left (A is on top of D) to right (right is empty).
   (corresponds to: move-agent-from-disk-to-empty agent_1 a d left right)

Summary:
- All moves are executed by agent_1 and match the plan lines exactly.
- Each primitive move duration is 1.0 time unit (timestamps shown above).
- Total reported plan cost: 8 (unit cost) as in the original plan.

Notes on compliance:
- All moves listed are legal Tower of Hanoi primitive moves (a single disk moved at a time, and each placement is onto an empty peg or onto a larger disk).
- Moves only involve disks A, B, C, D (all permitted for agent_1 according to the specification).
