Assumptions: each primitive move is treated as a single step taking 1s. Timestamps are cumulative starting at 00:00:00. All moves are executed by agent_1 (agent_1 is permitted to move disks A–G).

Step 1 — 00:00:00 (duration 1s)
agent_1: move disk A from on top of disk B to peg middle.

Step 2 — 00:00:01 (duration 1s)
agent_1: move disk B from on top of disk C to peg right.

Step 3 — 00:00:02 (duration 1s)
agent_1: move disk A from peg middle to on top of disk B.

Step 4 — 00:00:03 (duration 1s)
agent_1: move disk C from on top of disk D to peg middle.

Step 5 — 00:00:04 (duration 1s)
agent_1: move disk A from on top of disk B to on top of disk D.

Step 6 — 00:00:05 (duration 1s)
agent_1: move disk B from peg right to on top of disk C.

Step 7 — 00:00:06 (duration 1s)
agent_1: move disk A from on top of disk D to on top of disk B.

Step 8 — 00:00:07 (duration 1s)
agent_1: move disk A from on top of disk B to peg right.

Step 9 — 00:00:08 (duration 1s)
agent_1: move disk B from on top of disk C to on top of disk D.

Step 10 — 00:00:09 (duration 1s)
agent_1: move disk A from peg right to on top of disk B.

Step 11 — 00:00:10 (duration 1s)
agent_1: move disk C from peg middle to peg right.

Step 12 — 00:00:11 (duration 1s)
agent_1: move disk A from on top of disk B to peg middle.

Step 13 — 00:00:12 (duration 1s)
agent_1: move disk B from on top of disk D to on top of disk C.

Step 14 — 00:00:13 (duration 1s)
agent_1: move disk A from peg middle to on top of disk B.

Step 15 — 00:00:14 (duration 1s)
agent_1: move disk D from on top of disk E to peg middle.

Step 16 — 00:00:15 (duration 1s)
agent_1: move disk A from on top of disk B to on top of disk E.

Step 17 — 00:00:16 (duration 1s)
agent_1: move disk B from on top of disk C to on top of disk D.

Step 18 — 00:00:17 (duration 1s)
agent_1: move disk A from on top of disk E to on top of disk B.

Step 19 — 00:00:18 (duration 1s)
agent_1: move disk C from peg right to on top of disk E.

Step 20 — 00:00:19 (duration 1s)
agent_1: move disk A from on top of disk B to peg right.

Step 21 — 00:00:20 (duration 1s)
agent_1: move disk B from on top of disk D to on top of disk C.

Step 22 — 00:00:21 (duration 1s)
agent_1: move disk A from peg right to on top of disk D.

Step 23 — 00:00:22 (duration 1s)
agent_1: move disk B from on top of disk C to peg right.

Step 24 — 00:00:23 (duration 1s)
agent_1: move disk A from on top of disk D to on top of disk B.

Step 25 — 00:00:24 (duration 1s)
agent_1: move disk C from on top of disk E to on top of disk D.

Step 26 — 00:00:25 (duration 1s)
agent_1: move disk A from on top of disk B to on top of disk E.

Step 27 — 00:00:26 (duration 1s)
agent_1: move disk B from peg right to on top of disk C.

Step 28 — 00:00:27 (duration 1s)
agent_1: move disk A from on top of disk E to on top of disk B.

Summary: 28 primitive moves by agent_1, total elapsed time 28s (assuming 1s per move). This sequence exactly follows the provided plan and uses only disks agent_1 is permitted to move (A–G).
