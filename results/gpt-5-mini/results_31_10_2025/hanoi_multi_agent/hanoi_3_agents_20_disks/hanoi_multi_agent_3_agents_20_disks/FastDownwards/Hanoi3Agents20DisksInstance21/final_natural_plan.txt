Planned execution (total cost = 7). Start time t=0s.

1) t=0s — duration ~5s  
agent_1: move disk A from left to right

2) t=5s — duration ~5s  
agent_1: move disk B from left to middle

3) t=10s — duration ~5s  
agent_1: move disk A from right to middle

4) t=15s — duration ~5s  
agent_1: move disk C from left to right

5) t=20s — duration ~5s  
agent_1: move disk A from middle to left

6) t=25s — duration ~5s  
agent_1: move disk B from middle to right

7) t=30s — duration ~5s  
agent_1: move disk A from left to middle

Completion: t≈35s — The sequence follows the provided plan exactly, uses only allowed agent moves (agent_1 moves disks A–G), respects Tower of Hanoi rules, and achieves the specified final placement for disks A, B, and C.
