Summary: The plan below follows the given PDDL plan step-for-step. Each line is a single primitive action by agent_1. Timestamps assume each action starts 1 second after the previous and takes 1s. Total steps: 16. Total cost (unit cost per action): 16.

Step 01 — t=0s (duration 1s): agent_1: move disk A from on top of disk B to the right peg.
Step 02 — t=1s (duration 1s): agent_1: move disk B from on top of disk C to the middle peg.
Step 03 — t=2s (duration 1s): agent_1: move disk A from the right peg onto disk B.
Step 04 — t=3s (duration 1s): agent_1: move disk C from on top of disk D to the right peg.
Step 05 — t=4s (duration 1s): agent_1: move disk A from on top of disk B onto disk D.
Step 06 — t=5s (duration 1s): agent_1: move disk B from the middle peg onto disk C.
Step 07 — t=6s (duration 1s): agent_1: move disk A from on top of disk D onto disk B.
Step 08 — t=7s (duration 1s): agent_1: move disk D from on top of disk E to the middle peg.
Step 09 — t=8s (duration 1s): agent_1: move disk A from on top of disk B onto disk E.
Step 10 — t=9s (duration 1s): agent_1: move disk A from on top of disk E onto disk D.
Step 11 — t=10s (duration 1s): agent_1: move disk B from on top of disk C onto disk E.
Step 12 — t=11s (duration 1s): agent_1: move disk A from on top of disk D onto disk B.
Step 13 — t=12s (duration 1s): agent_1: move disk C from the right peg onto disk D.
Step 14 — t=13s (duration 1s): agent_1: move disk A from on top of disk B to the right peg.
Step 15 — t=14s (duration 1s): agent_1: move disk B from on top of disk E onto disk C.
Step 16 — t=15s (duration 1s): agent_1: move disk A from the right peg onto disk E.

End state after these actions (consistent with the goal):
- Left peg top->bottom: A on E on F on G on H ... on T
- Middle peg top->bottom: B on C on D
- Right peg: empty

Cost = 16 (unit cost per action).
