Below is a step-by-step, human-readable execution of the provided PDDL plan. Each step corresponds exactly to one action in the plan (no actions added or removed). I report a simple timestamp assuming each primitive move takes 1 time unit (start time = step_index - 1, end time = step_index). Agent names, disk labels (A–G), and peg names (left, middle, right) follow the public specification.

1) Time 0 → 1
   agent_1: Move disk A from on top of disk B to the middle peg (middle). Duration: 1 unit.

2) Time 1 → 2
   agent_1: Move disk B from on top of disk C to the right peg (right). Duration: 1 unit.

3) Time 2 → 3
   agent_1: Move disk A from the middle peg (middle) onto disk B. Duration: 1 unit.

4) Time 3 → 4
   agent_1: Move disk C from on top of disk D to the middle peg (middle). Duration: 1 unit.

    agent_1: Move disk A from on top of disk E onto disk D. Duration: 1 unit.

14) Time 13 → 14
    agent_1: Move disk B from on top of disk C onto disk E. Duration: 1 unit.

15) Time 14 → 15
    agent_1: Move disk A from on top of disk D onto disk C. Duration: 1 unit.

16) Time 15 → 16
    agent_1: Move disk A from on top of disk C onto disk B. Duration: 1 unit.

17) Time 16 → 17
    agent_1: Move disk C from the middle peg (middle) onto disk D. Duration: 1 unit.

18) Time 17 → 18
    agent_1: Move disk A from on top of disk B to the middle peg (middle). Duration: 1 unit.

19) Time 18 → 19
    agent_1: Move disk B from on top of disk E onto disk C. Duration: 1 unit.

20) Time 19 → 20
    agent_1: Move disk A from the middle peg (middle) onto disk E. Duration: 1 unit.

21) Time 20 → 21
    agent_1: Move disk A from on top of disk E onto disk B. Duration: 1 unit.

22) Time 21 → 22
    agent_1: Move disk E from on top of disk F to the middle peg (middle). Duration: 1 unit.

23) Time 22 → 23
    agent_1: Move disk A from on top of disk B onto disk E. Duration: 1 unit.

24) Time 23 → 24

29) Time 28 → 29
    agent_1: Move disk B from on top of disk F onto disk D. Duration: 1 unit.

30) Time 29 → 30
    agent_1: Move disk A from on top of disk C onto disk B. Duration: 1 unit.

31) Time 30 → 31
    agent_1: Move disk C from on top of disk E onto disk F. Duration: 1 unit.

32) Time 31 → 32
    agent_1: Move disk A from on top of disk B onto disk E. Duration: 1 unit.

Summary:
- All 32 moves were performed by agent_1 and concern only disks A–G, matching the agent's permissions.
- Assumed uniform duration: 1 unit per move; total time 32 units.
- Plan cost (unit cost): 32.
