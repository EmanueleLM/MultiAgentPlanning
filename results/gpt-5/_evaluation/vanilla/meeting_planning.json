If your preferred meeting length differs, I can recompute.\n\nConsidered schedules:\n1) One late transfer (Marina all day, then Richmond for evening)\n- Travel before Betty: 11 minutes total (one Marina→Richmond).\n- Pre-Betty time available: 9:00 AM–8:30 PM = 690 minutes. 690 − 11 = 679 minutes, which fits 11 full 60-minute friend blocks before 8:30.\n- Outcome: 11 friends before 8:30 + Betty (75+ min) = 12 total friends with just one cross-town move.\n\n2) Two cross-town transfers (midday Richmond block, back to Marina, then Richmond again for Betty)\n- Extra travel before Betty: +20 minutes (Richmond→Marina 9 + Marina→Richmond 11).\n- Pre-Betty usable time: 690 − (11 + 20) = 659 minutes = 10 full friend blocks.\n- Outcome: 10 friends before 8:30 + Betty = 11 total. Worse due to lost time in transit.\n\n3) Early transfer and stay in Richmond through evening\n- Same total pre-Betty travel as (1): 11 minutes.\n- Outcome: also 11 friends before 8:30 + Betty = 12 total. Ties (1), pick based on where most of your friends are.\n\nBest plan: One late transfer (minimizes transit, maximizes meetings)\n\nConcrete schedule (chosen):\n- 9:00 AM–7:00 PM: 10 back-to-back 60-min meetups in Marina (start on the hour).\n- 7:00–7:11 PM: Travel Marina→Richmond (11 min).\n- 7:15–8:15 PM: 1 meetup in Richmond.\n- 8:30–9:45 PM: Meet Betty in Richmond (75 minutes, satisfies the minimum; you can extend to 10:00 PM for 90 minutes if you prefer).\n- Optional: 9:45–9:54 PM travel back to Marina (9 min) if you need to return.\n\nWhy this is optimal under the assumption:\n- It uses only one cross-town leg before Betty, maximizing the number of full meeting blocks (11) you can fit before her 8:30 PM start. Any extra cross-town moves reduce your count by at least one meeting.\n- It leaves a 15-minute margin (8:15–8:30) before Betty, avoiding any risk of being late.\n\nNotes:\n- If you’d rather have 30- or 45-minute meetups, the same one-transfer structure still dominates; I can recalc the exact counts and times to fit your preferred meeting length.",

Cons: More travel; slightly less total contiguous time in your arrival neighborhood than Schedule 1.\n\nBest choice to optimize “meet as many friends as possible” without other constraints: Schedule 1\n- Rationale: With unknown friend availability and only one guaranteed meetup (Nancy), the dominant move is to maximize total open meeting time while minimizing travel. Schedule 1 gives you 11h 15m straight in Sunset plus 75 minutes with Nancy, with just one pre-Nancy travel leg. It preserves the broadest, least fragmented window to stack as many Sunset meetings as possible and still meet Nancy.\n\nFinal itinerary (selected)\n- 9:00 AM: Arrive Sunset District.\n- 9:00 AM–8:15 PM: Meet Sunset friends.\n- 8:15–8:30 PM: Travel to Haight-Ashbury.\n- 8:30–9:45 PM: Meet Nancy (meets the 75-minute minimum exactly).\n- Optional: 9:45–10:00 PM return to Sunset if you have additional late-night availability there.\n\nHelpful timing notes\n- Latest departure from Sunset to still meet Nancy for 75 minutes: 8:15 PM (arrive 8:30 PM, leave at 9:45 PM).\n- Earliest end time that still satisfies Nancy if you start at 7:30 PM: 8:45 PM (you could then be back in Sunset by ~9:00 PM, i.e., Schedule 2 variant).",
