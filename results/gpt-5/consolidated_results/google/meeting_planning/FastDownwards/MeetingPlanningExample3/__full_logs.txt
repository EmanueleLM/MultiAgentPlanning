Represent time as discrete steps or via supported numeric constructs so that FastDownwards can solve it; if uncertain, prefer a discrete time progression with a finite horizon. Use clear object and predicate naming, avoid ambiguities, and only include objects present in the public information.",

No return travel needed to satisfy constraints.\n\nRationale: Given travel 22 min RD->FD, a single 5-minute wait primitive, and availability starting at 17:15, the earliest feasible meeting start aligned to the 5-minute grid is 17:17. This schedule then packs the maximum total meeting minutes achievable with 60-minute and 15-minute meeting actions without exceeding 21:45, yielding 255 minutes."

Time = 562 (09:22).\n- 09:22\u201317:17 (+475): Wait at Financial District in 5-minute increments. Time = 1037 (17:17).\n- 17:17\u201318:17 (+60): Meet Betty (meet-betty-60). Time = 1097 (18:17).

No return travel needed to satisfy constraints.\n\nRationale: Given travel 22 min RD->FD, a single 5-minute wait primitive, and availability starting at 17:15, the earliest feasible meeting start aligned to the 5-minute grid is 17:17. This schedule then packs the maximum total meeting minutes achievable with 60-minute and 15-minute meeting actions without exceeding 21:45, yielding 255 minutes."

No return travel needed to satisfy constraints.\n\nRationale: Given travel 22 min RD->FD, a single 5-minute wait primitive, and availability starting at 17:15, the earliest feasible meeting start aligned to the 5-minute grid is 17:17. This schedule then packs the maximum total meeting minutes achievable with 60-minute and 15-minute meeting actions without exceeding 21:45, yielding 255 minutes."

No return travel needed to satisfy constraints.\n\nRationale: Given travel 22 min RD->FD, a single 5-minute wait primitive, and availability starting at 17:15, the earliest feasible meeting start aligned to the 5-minute grid is 17:17. This schedule then packs the maximum total meeting minutes achievable with 60-minute and 15-minute meeting actions without exceeding 21:45, yielding 255 minutes."

Time = 562 (09:22).\n- 09:22\u201317:17 (+475): Wait at Financial District in 5-minute increments. Time = 1037 (17:17).\n- 17:17\u201318:17 (+60): Meet Betty (meet-betty-60). Time = 1097 (18:17).

No return travel needed to satisfy constraints.\n\nRationale: Given travel 22 min RD->FD, a single 5-minute wait primitive, and availability starting at 17:15, the earliest feasible meeting start aligned to the 5-minute grid is 17:17. This schedule then packs the maximum total meeting minutes achievable with 60-minute and 15-minute meeting actions without exceeding 21:45, yielding 255 minutes."
