Here is the human-readable sequence that mirrors the given plan exactly, using 15-minute ticks from 09:00 (t0). Times shown as clock time and tick transition.

1) 09:00 Begin travel from Nob Hill to The Castro (begin-travel)
2) 09:00–09:15 Travel leg 1 of 2, in transit (travel-step-2, t0→t1)
3) 09:15–09:30 Travel leg 2 of 2, in transit (travel-step-1, t1→t2)
4) 09:30 Arrive at The Castro (arrive)

5) 09:30–09:45 Wait at The Castro (wait, t2→t3)
6) 09:45–10:00 Wait at The Castro (wait, t3→t4)
7) 10:00–10:15 Wait at The Castro (wait, t4→t5)
8) 10:15–10:30 Wait at The Castro (wait, t5→t6)
9) 10:30–10:45 Wait at The Castro (wait, t6→t7)
10) 10:45–11:00 Wait at The Castro (wait, t7→t8)
11) 11:00–11:15 Wait at The Castro (wait, t8→t9)
12) 11:15–11:30 Wait at The Castro (wait, t9→t10)
13) 11:30–11:45 Wait at The Castro (wait, t10→t11)
14) 11:45–12:00 Wait at The Castro (wait, t11→t12)
15) 12:00–12:15 Wait at The Castro (wait, t12→t13)

16) 12:15–12:30 Meet William at The Castro (meet-william-1, t13→t14)
17) 12:30–12:45 Meet William at The Castro (meet-william-2, t14→t15)
18) 12:45–13:00 Meet William at The Castro (meet-william-3, t15→t16)
19) 13:00–13:15 Meet William at The Castro (meet-william-4, t16→t17)
20) 13:15–13:30 Meet William at The Castro (meet-william-5, t17→t18)

Summary:
- Travel used 2 discrete ticks (30 minutes total), conservatively rounded.
