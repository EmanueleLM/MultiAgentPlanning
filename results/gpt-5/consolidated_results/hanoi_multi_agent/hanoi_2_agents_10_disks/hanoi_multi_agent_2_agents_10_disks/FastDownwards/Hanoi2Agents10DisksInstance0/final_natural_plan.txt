Here is the human-readable action sequence, following the provided plan exactly:

1. [t=00:00] agent_1: move disk a from disk b to peg middle
2. [t=00:01] agent_1: move disk b from disk c to peg right
3. [t=00:02] agent_1: move disk a from peg middle onto disk c
4. [t=00:03] agent_1: move disk a from disk c onto disk b
5. [t=00:04] agent_1: move disk c from disk d to peg middle
6. [t=00:05] agent_1: move disk a from disk b onto disk c
7. [t=00:06] agent_1: move disk b from peg right onto disk d
8. [t=00:07] agent_1: move disk a from disk c onto disk b
9. [t=00:08] agent_1: move disk c from peg middle to peg right
10. [t=00:09] agent_1: move disk a from disk b to peg middle
11. [t=00:10] agent_1: move disk b from disk d onto disk c
12. [t=00:11] agent_1: move disk a from peg middle onto disk b
13. [t=00:12] agent_1: move disk d from disk e to peg middle
14. [t=00:13] agent_1: move disk a from disk b onto disk e
15. [t=00:14] agent_1: move disk b from disk c onto disk d
16. [t=00:15] agent_1: move disk a from disk e onto disk c

This sequence respects all agent restrictions and Tower of Hanoi rules and achieves the specified goal configuration.
