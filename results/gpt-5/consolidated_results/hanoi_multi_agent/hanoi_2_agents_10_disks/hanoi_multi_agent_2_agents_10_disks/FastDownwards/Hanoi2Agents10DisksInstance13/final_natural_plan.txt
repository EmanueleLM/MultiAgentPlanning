Here is the human-readable action sequence corresponding exactly to the provided plan. Each move takes 1 time unit and advances the stage from sN to sN+1.

1. [s0 → s1 | Δt = 1] agent_1 moves disk A from atop disk B on the left peg to the middle peg.
2. [s1 → s2 | Δt = 1] agent_1 moves disk B from atop disk C on the left peg to the right peg.
3. [s2 → s3 | Δt = 1] agent_1 moves disk A from the middle peg onto disk B on the right peg.
4. [s3 → s4 | Δt = 1] agent_1 moves disk C from atop disk D on the left peg to the middle peg.
5. [s4 → s5 | Δt = 1] agent_1 moves disk A from atop disk B on the right peg onto disk C on the middle peg.
6. [s5 → s6 | Δt = 1] agent_1 moves disk B from the right peg onto disk D on the left peg.
7. [s6 → s7 | Δt = 1] agent_1 moves disk A from atop disk C on the middle peg onto disk B on the left peg.
