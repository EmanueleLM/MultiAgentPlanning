PROBLEM
------------------------------
Devise a cooperative plan for a 2-agent Tower of Hanoi with 10 disks labelled A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J (A is the smallest, J the largest). Agents are limited to moving specific disks: agent_1 ⇒ A, B, C, D, E; agent_2 ⇒ F, G, H, I, J. Initial configuration: left peg has (top→bottom) A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J; middle peg is empty; right peg is empty. Goal configuration: left peg has (top→bottom) E, F, G, H, I, J; middle peg has (top→bottom) B, D; right peg has (top→bottom) A, C. Provide an ordered list of primitive moves in the format 'agent_i: move disk X from peg1 to peg2', respecting the agent restrictions and the Tower of Hanoi rules.

Encode 3 pegs (left, middle, right) and 10 disks (A..J). Use these types: agent, peg, support (supertype), disk (subtype of support), peg (subtype of support). Predicates: on ?d - disk ?s - support; clear ?s - support; smaller ?x - disk ?y - disk; controls ?a - agent ?d - disk. Actions must be STRIPS: split moving onto a peg vs onto a disk to avoid conditional preconditions; both require clear-destination and on-source, and the disk must be clear. Initial state must match the given initial configuration; goal must match the specified final configuration. Enclose the PDDL domain between <domain></domain> tags and the PDDL problem between <problem></problem> tags, suitable for Fast Downward."

NATURAL-PLAN sas_plan_3
------------------------------
Here is the human-readable action sequence, following the provided plan exactly:

1. [t=00:00] agent_1: move disk a from disk b to peg middle
2. [t=00:01] agent_1: move disk b from disk c to peg right
3. [t=00:02] agent_1: move disk a from peg middle onto disk c
4. [t=00:03] agent_1: move disk a from disk c onto disk b
5. [t=00:04] agent_1: move disk c from disk d to peg middle
6. [t=00:05] agent_1: move disk a from disk b onto disk c
7. [t=00:06] agent_1: move disk b from peg right onto disk d
8. [t=00:07] agent_1: move disk a from disk c onto disk b
9. [t=00:08] agent_1: move disk c from peg middle to peg right
10. [t=00:09] agent_1: move disk a from disk b to peg middle
11. [t=00:10] agent_1: move disk b from disk d onto disk c
12. [t=00:11] agent_1: move disk a from peg middle onto disk b
13. [t=00:12] agent_1: move disk d from disk e to peg middle
14. [t=00:13] agent_1: move disk a from disk b onto disk e
15. [t=00:14] agent_1: move disk b from disk c onto disk d
16. [t=00:15] agent_1: move disk a from disk e onto disk c

This sequence respects all agent restrictions and Tower of Hanoi rules and achieves the specified goal configuration.

PROBLEM
------------------------------
Devise a cooperative plan for a 2-agent Tower of Hanoi with 10 disks labelled A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J (A is the smallest, J the largest). Agents are limited to moving specific disks: agent_1 ⇒ A, B, C, D, E; agent_2 ⇒ F, G, H, I, J. Initial configuration: left peg has (top→bottom) A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J; middle peg is empty; right peg is empty. Goal configuration: left peg has (top→bottom) A, E, F, G, H, I, J; middle peg is empty; right peg has (top→bottom) B, C, D. Provide an ordered list of primitive moves in the format 'agent_i: move disk X from peg1 to peg2', respecting the agent restrictions and the Tower of Hanoi rules.

PROBLEM
------------------------------
Devise a cooperative plan for a 2-agent Tower of Hanoi with 10 disks labelled A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J (A is the smallest, J the largest). Agents are limited to moving specific disks: agent_1 ⇒ A, B, C, D, E; agent_2 ⇒ F, G, H, I, J. Initial configuration: left peg has (top→bottom) A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J; middle peg is empty; right peg is empty. Goal configuration: left peg has (top→bottom) E, F, G, H, I, J; middle peg is empty; right peg has (top→bottom) A, B, C, D. Provide an ordered list of primitive moves in the format 'agent_i: move disk X from peg1 to peg2', respecting the agent restrictions and the Tower of Hanoi rules.

Use :requirements at least :strips :typing :adl. Use types agent, obj, peg - obj, disk - obj. Model predicates on(disk, obj), clear(obj), smaller(disk, disk), can-move(agent, disk). Provide two actions: move-to-peg and move-to-disk, each with agent parameter, enforcing can-move and, for move-to-disk, the smaller constraint. Ensure the problem encodes the initial and goal configurations exactly and includes all can-move facts per agent.

PROBLEM
------------------------------
Devise a cooperative plan for a 2-agent Tower of Hanoi with 10 disks labelled A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J (A is the smallest, J the largest). Agents are limited to moving specific disks: agent_1 ⇒ A, B, C, D, E; agent_2 ⇒ F, G, H, I, J. Initial configuration: left peg has (top→bottom) A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J; middle peg is empty; right peg is empty. Goal configuration: left peg has (top→bottom) A, B, E, F, G, H, I, J; middle peg is empty; right peg has (top→bottom) C, D. Provide an ordered list of primitive moves in the format 'agent_i: move disk X from peg1 to peg2', respecting the agent restrictions and the Tower of Hanoi rules.
