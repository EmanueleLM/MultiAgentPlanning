Here is the human-readable action sequence that mirrors the given plan exactly. Each step shows the stage transition as a timestamp (sX→sY) and assumes unit duration 1.

1) [s0 → s1 | duration: 1] agent_1 moves disk A from left peg to middle peg.
2) [s1 → s2 | duration: 1] agent_1 moves disk B from left peg to right peg.
3) [s2 → s3 | duration: 1] agent_1 moves disk A from middle peg to right peg (onto B).
4) [s3 → s4 | duration: 1] agent_1 moves disk C from left peg to middle peg.
5) [s4 → s5 | duration: 1] agent_1 moves disk A from right peg to left peg (onto D).
6) [s5 → s6 | duration: 1] agent_1 moves disk B from right peg to middle peg (onto C).
7) [s6 → s7 | duration: 1] agent_1 moves disk A from left peg to middle peg (onto B).
8) [s7 → s8 | duration: 1] agent_1 moves disk D from left peg to right peg.
9) [s8 → s9 | duration: 1] agent_1 moves disk A from middle peg to right peg (onto D).
10) [s9 → s10 | duration: 1] agent_1 moves disk B from middle peg to left peg (onto E).
11) [s10 → s11 | duration: 1] agent_1 moves disk A from right peg to middle peg (onto C).
