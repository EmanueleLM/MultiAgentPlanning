Here is the human-readable sequence of actions that follows the provided plan exactly. Timestamps are sequential indices (t=01..t=26), one unit per move.

t=01: agent_1: move disk A from left to right.
t=02: agent_1: move disk B from left to middle.
t=03: agent_1: move disk A from right to middle, onto disk B.
t=04: agent_1: move disk C from left to right.
t=05: agent_1: move disk A from middle to left, onto disk D.
t=06: agent_1: move disk B from middle to right, onto disk C.
t=07: agent_1: move disk A from left to right, onto disk B.
t=08: agent_1: move disk D from left to middle.
t=09: agent_1: move disk A from right to middle, onto disk D.
t=10: agent_1: move disk B from right to left, onto disk E.
t=11: agent_1: move disk A from middle to left, onto disk B.
t=12: agent_1: move disk C from right to middle, onto disk D.
t=13: agent_1: move disk A from left to middle, onto disk C.
t=14: agent_1: move disk B from left to right.
t=15: agent_1: move disk A from middle to left, onto disk E.
t=16: agent_1: move disk B from right to middle, onto disk C.
t=17: agent_1: move disk A from left to middle, onto disk B.
t=18: agent_1: move disk E from left to right.
t=19: agent_1: move disk A from middle to left, onto disk F.
t=20: agent_1: move disk B from middle to right, onto disk E.
t=21: agent_1: move disk A from left to right, onto disk B.
t=22: agent_1: move disk A from right to middle, onto disk C.
t=23: agent_1: move disk B from right to left, onto disk F.
t=24: agent_1: move disk A from middle to left, onto disk B.
t=25: agent_1: move disk C from middle to right, onto disk E.
t=26: agent_1: move disk A from left to middle, onto disk D.

Final configuration achieved:
- left: B,F,G,H,I,J,K,L,M,N,O (top to bottom)
- middle: A,D (top to bottom)
- right: C,E (top to bottom)
