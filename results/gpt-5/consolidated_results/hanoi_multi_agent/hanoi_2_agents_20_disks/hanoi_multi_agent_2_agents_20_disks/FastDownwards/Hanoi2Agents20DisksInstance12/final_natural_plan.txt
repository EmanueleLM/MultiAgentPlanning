Here is the exact sequence of human-readable actions corresponding to the provided plan. Each move takes 1 time unit.

1) t=0–1: agent_1 moves disk A from on top of B (left peg) to the right peg.
2) t=1–2: agent_1 moves disk B from on top of C (left peg) to the middle peg.
3) t=2–3: agent_1 moves disk A from the right peg to on top of C (left peg).
4) t=3–4: agent_1 moves disk A from on top of C (left peg) to on top of B (middle peg).
5) t=4–5: agent_1 moves disk C from on top of D (left peg) to the right peg.
6) t=5–6: agent_1 moves disk A from on top of B (middle peg) to on top of C (right peg).

Resulting configuration:
- Left peg: D (top) through T (bottom)
- Middle peg: B
- Right peg: A on top of C

Total time: 6 time units (unit cost: 6).
