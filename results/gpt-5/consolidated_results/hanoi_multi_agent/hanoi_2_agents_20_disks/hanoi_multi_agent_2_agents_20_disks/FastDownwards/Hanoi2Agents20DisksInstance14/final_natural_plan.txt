Here is the finalized, human-readable action sequence matching the PDDL plan exactly, with simple timestamps and unit durations:

1. [t=0, dur=1] agent_1: move disk A from left to right
2. [t=1, dur=1] agent_1: move disk B from left to middle
3. [t=2, dur=1] agent_1: move disk A from right to middle
4. [t=3, dur=1] agent_1: move disk C from left to right
5. [t=4, dur=1] agent_1: move disk A from middle to right
6. [t=5, dur=1] agent_1: move disk B from middle to left
7. [t=6, dur=1] agent_1: move disk A from right to left
8. [t=7, dur=1] agent_1: move disk C from right to middle

Result: C ends on the middle peg; the left peg has A on B on top of D through T; the right peg is empty. All moves respect agent capabilities and Tower of Hanoi legality.
