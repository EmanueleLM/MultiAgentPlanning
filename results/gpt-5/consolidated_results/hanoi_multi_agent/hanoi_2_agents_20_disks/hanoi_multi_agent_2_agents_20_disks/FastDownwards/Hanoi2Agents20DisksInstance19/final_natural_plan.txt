Here is the ordered sequence of primitive moves, matching the plan exactly. Timestamps use the plan’s step tokens (s1→s2, …, s6→s7).

1. [s1→s2] agent_1: move disk A from left to right
2. [s2→s3] agent_1: move disk B from left to middle
3. [s3→s4] agent_1: move disk A from right to middle
4. [s4→s5] agent_1: move disk C from left to right
5. [s5→s6] agent_1: move disk A from middle to left
6. [s6→s7] agent_1: move disk B from middle to right
