Here is the human-readable action sequence that follows the provided plan exactly. Each action lists the time transition (sX→sY) and assumes unit duration.

1) Time s0→s1 (duration 1): agent_1 moves disk A from the left peg to the middle peg.
2) Time s1→s2 (duration 1): agent_1 moves disk B from the left peg to the right peg.
3) Time s2→s3 (duration 1): agent_1 moves disk A from the middle peg to the right peg, placing it onto disk B.
4) Time s3→s4 (duration 1): agent_1 moves disk C from the left peg to the middle peg.
5) Time s4→s5 (duration 1): agent_1 moves disk A from the right peg to the left peg, placing it onto disk D.
6) Time s5→s6 (duration 1): agent_1 moves disk B from the right peg to the middle peg, placing it onto disk C.
7) Time s6→s7 (duration 1): agent_1 moves disk A from the left peg to the middle peg, placing it onto disk B.
8) Time s7→s8 (duration 1): agent_1 moves disk D from the left peg to the right peg.
9) Time s8→s9 (duration 1): agent_1 moves disk A from the middle peg to the right peg, placing it onto disk D.
