PROBLEM
------------------------------
Devise a cooperative plan for a 2-agent Tower of Hanoi with 20 disks labelled A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, O, P, Q, R, S, T (A is the smallest, T the largest). Agents are limited to moving specific disks: agent_1 ⇒ A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J; agent_2 ⇒ K, L, M, N, O, P, Q, R, S, T. Initial configuration: left peg has (top→bottom) A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, O, P, Q, R, S, T; middle peg is empty; right peg is empty. Goal configuration: left peg has (top→bottom) F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, O, P, Q, R, S, T; middle peg has (top→bottom) C, D, E; right peg has (top→bottom) A, B. Provide an ordered list of primitive moves in the format 'agent_i: move disk X from peg1 to peg2', respecting the agent restrictions and the Tower of Hanoi rules.

PROBLEM
------------------------------
Devise a cooperative plan for a 2-agent Tower of Hanoi with 20 disks labelled A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, O, P, Q, R, S, T (A is the smallest, T the largest). Agents are limited to moving specific disks: agent_1 ⇒ A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J; agent_2 ⇒ K, L, M, N, O, P, Q, R, S, T. Initial configuration: left peg has (top→bottom) A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, O, P, Q, R, S, T; middle peg is empty; right peg is empty. Goal configuration: left peg has (top→bottom) F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, O, P, Q, R, S, T; middle peg has (top→bottom) E; right peg has (top→bottom) A, B, C, D. Provide an ordered list of primitive moves in the format 'agent_i: move disk X from peg1 to peg2', respecting the agent restrictions and the Tower of Hanoi rules.

NATURAL-PLAN sas_plan_3
------------------------------
Here is the human-readable action sequence that follows the given plan exactly:

1) [s0 → s1 | duration: 1] agent_1 moves disk A from left to middle.
2) [s1 → s2 | duration: 1] agent_1 moves disk B from left to right.
3) [s2 → s3 | duration: 1] agent_1 moves disk A from middle to right, placing it onto disk B.
4) [s3 → s4 | duration: 1] agent_1 moves disk C from left to middle.
5) [s4 → s5 | duration: 1] agent_1 moves disk A from right to left, placing it onto disk D.
6) [s5 → s6 | duration: 1] agent_1 moves disk B from right to middle, placing it onto disk C.
7) [s6 → s7 | duration: 1] agent_1 moves disk A from left to middle, placing it onto disk B.
8) [s7 → s8 | duration: 1] agent_1 moves disk D from left to right.
9) [s8 → s9 | duration: 1] agent_1 moves disk A from middle to right, placing it onto disk D.
10) [s9 → s10 | duration: 1] agent_1 moves disk B from middle to left, placing it onto disk E.
11) [s10 → s11 | duration: 1] agent_1 moves disk A from right to left, placing it onto disk B.
12) [s11 → s12 | duration: 1] agent_1 moves disk C from middle to right, placing it onto disk D.
13) [s12 → s13 | duration: 1] agent_1 moves disk A from left to middle.
14) [s13 → s14 | duration: 1] agent_1 moves disk B from left to right, placing it onto disk C.
15) [s14 → s15 | duration: 1] agent_1 moves disk A from middle to right, placing it onto disk B.
16) [s15 → s16 | duration: 1] agent_1 moves disk E from left to middle.
