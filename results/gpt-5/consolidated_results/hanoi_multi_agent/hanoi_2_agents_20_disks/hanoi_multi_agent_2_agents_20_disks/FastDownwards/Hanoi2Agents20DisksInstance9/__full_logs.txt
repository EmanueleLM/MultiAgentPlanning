PROBLEM
------------------------------
Devise a cooperative plan for a 2-agent Tower of Hanoi with 20 disks labelled A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, O, P, Q, R, S, T (A is the smallest, T the largest). Agents are limited to moving specific disks: agent_1 ⇒ A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J; agent_2 ⇒ K, L, M, N, O, P, Q, R, S, T. Initial configuration: left peg has (top→bottom) A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, O, P, Q, R, S, T; middle peg is empty; right peg is empty. Goal configuration: left peg has (top→bottom) F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, O, P, Q, R, S, T; middle peg has (top→bottom) C, D, E; right peg has (top→bottom) A, B. Provide an ordered list of primitive moves in the format 'agent_i: move disk X from peg1 to peg2', respecting the agent restrictions and the Tower of Hanoi rules.

PROBLEM
------------------------------
Devise a cooperative plan for a 2-agent Tower of Hanoi with 20 disks labelled A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, O, P, Q, R, S, T (A is the smallest, T the largest). Agents are limited to moving specific disks: agent_1 ⇒ A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J; agent_2 ⇒ K, L, M, N, O, P, Q, R, S, T. Initial configuration: left peg has (top→bottom) A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, O, P, Q, R, S, T; middle peg is empty; right peg is empty. Goal configuration: left peg has (top→bottom) F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, O, P, Q, R, S, T; middle peg has (top→bottom) E; right peg has (top→bottom) A, B, C, D. Provide an ordered list of primitive moves in the format 'agent_i: move disk X from peg1 to peg2', respecting the agent restrictions and the Tower of Hanoi rules.

Here is the human-readable action sequence that follows the given plan exactly:

1) [s0 → s1 | duration: 1] agent_1 moves disk A from left to middle.
2) [s1 → s2 | duration: 1] agent_1 moves disk B from left to right.
3) [s2 → s3 | duration: 1] agent_1 moves disk A from middle to right, placing it onto disk B.
4) [s3 → s4 | duration: 1] agent_1 moves disk C from left to middle.
5) [s4 → s5 | duration: 1] agent_1 moves disk A from right to left, placing it onto disk D.
6) [s5 → s6 | duration: 1] agent_1 moves disk B from right to middle, placing it onto disk C.
7) [s6 → s7 | duration: 1] agent_1 moves disk A from left to middle, placing it onto disk B.
8) [s7 → s8 | duration: 1] agent_1 moves disk D from left to right.
9) [s8 → s9 | duration: 1] agent_1 moves disk A from middle to right, placing it onto disk D.
10) [s9 → s10 | duration: 1] agent_1 moves disk B from middle to left, placing it onto disk E.
11) [s10 → s11 | duration: 1] agent_1 moves disk A from right to left, placing it onto disk B.
12) [s11 → s12 | duration: 1] agent_1 moves disk C from middle to right, placing it onto disk D.
13) [s12 → s13 | duration: 1] agent_1 moves disk A from left to middle.
14) [s13 → s14 | duration: 1] agent_1 moves disk B from left to right, placing it onto disk C.

PROBLEM
------------------------------
Devise a cooperative plan for a 2-agent Tower of Hanoi with 20 disks labelled A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, O, P, Q, R, S, T (A is the smallest, T the largest). Agents are limited to moving specific disks: agent_1 ⇒ A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J; agent_2 ⇒ K, L, M, N, O, P, Q, R, S, T. Initial configuration: left peg has (top→bottom) A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, O, P, Q, R, S, T; middle peg is empty; right peg is empty. Goal configuration: left peg has (top→bottom) A, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, O, P, Q, R, S, T; middle peg has (top→bottom) C; right peg has (top→bottom) B. Provide an ordered list of primitive moves in the format 'agent_i: move disk X from peg1 to peg2', respecting the agent restrictions and the Tower of Hanoi rules.

PROBLEM
------------------------------
Devise a cooperative plan for a 2-agent Tower of Hanoi with 20 disks labelled A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, O, P, Q, R, S, T (A is the smallest, T the largest). Agents are limited to moving specific disks: agent_1 ⇒ A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J; agent_2 ⇒ K, L, M, N, O, P, Q, R, S, T. Initial configuration: left peg has (top→bottom) A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, O, P, Q, R, S, T; middle peg is empty; right peg is empty. Goal configuration: left peg has (top→bottom) A, C, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, O, P, Q, R, S, T; middle peg has (top→bottom) D; right peg has (top→bottom) B. Provide an ordered list of primitive moves in the format 'agent_i: move disk X from peg1 to peg2', respecting the agent restrictions and the Tower of Hanoi rules.

NATURAL-PLAN sas_plan_5
------------------------------
Here is the final, ordered sequence of human-readable actions matching the PDDL plan. Each move is one time unit; timestamps are in discrete time units.

1. [t=0, duration=1] agent_1: move disk A from left to middle
2. [t=1, duration=1] agent_1: move disk B from left to right
3. [t=2, duration=1] agent_1: move disk A from middle to left
4. [t=3, duration=1] agent_1: move disk A from left to right
5. [t=4, duration=1] agent_1: move disk C from left to middle
6. [t=5, duration=1] agent_1: move disk A from right to middle
7. [t=6, duration=1] agent_1: move disk B from right to left
8. [t=7, duration=1] agent_1: move disk A from middle to left
9. [t=8, duration=1] agent_1: move disk C from middle to right
10. [t=9, duration=1] agent_1: move disk A from left to middle
11. [t=10, duration=1] agent_1: move disk B from left to right
12. [t=11, duration=1] agent_1: move disk A from middle to right
13. [t=12, duration=1] agent_1: move disk D from left to middle
14. [t=13, duration=1] agent_1: move disk A from right to middle
15. [t=14, duration=1] agent_1: move disk B from right to left
16. [t=15, duration=1] agent_1: move disk A from middle to right
17. [t=16, duration=1] agent_1: move disk B from left to middle
18. [t=17, duration=1] agent_1: move disk A from right to middle
19. [t=18, duration=1] agent_1: move disk C from right to left
20. [t=19, duration=1] agent_1: move disk A from middle to left
21. [t=20, duration=1] agent_1: move disk B from middle to right

Resulting configuration:
- Left peg: A, C, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, O, P, Q, R, S, T (top→bottom)
- Middle peg: D
- Right peg: B

All moves obey the Tower of Hanoi rules and agent constraints.

PROBLEM
------------------------------
Devise a cooperative plan for a 2-agent Tower of Hanoi with 20 disks labelled A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, O, P, Q, R, S, T (A is the smallest, T the largest). Agents are limited to moving specific disks: agent_1 ⇒ A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J; agent_2 ⇒ K, L, M, N, O, P, Q, R, S, T. Initial configuration: left peg has (top→bottom) A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, O, P, Q, R, S, T; middle peg is empty; right peg is empty. Goal configuration: left peg has (top→bottom) C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, O, P, Q, R, S, T; middle peg has (top→bottom) B; right peg has (top→bottom) A. Provide an ordered list of primitive moves in the format 'agent_i: move disk X from peg1 to peg2', respecting the agent restrictions and the Tower of Hanoi rules.
