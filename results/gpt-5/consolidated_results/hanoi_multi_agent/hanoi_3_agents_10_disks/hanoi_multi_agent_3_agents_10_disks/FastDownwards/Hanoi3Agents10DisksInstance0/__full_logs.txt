PROBLEM
------------------------------
Devise a cooperative plan for a 3-agent Tower of Hanoi with 10 disks labelled A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J (A is the smallest, J the largest). Agents are limited to moving specific disks: agent_1 ⇒ A, B, C, D; agent_2 ⇒ E, F, G; agent_3 ⇒ H, I, J. Initial configuration: left peg has (top→bottom) A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J; middle peg is empty; right peg is empty. Goal configuration: left peg has (top→bottom) B, D, E, F, G, H, I, J; middle peg is empty; right peg has (top→bottom) A, C. Provide an ordered list of primitive moves in the format 'agent_i: move disk X from peg1 to peg2', respecting the agent restrictions and the Tower of Hanoi rules.

The domain should include types (agent, disk, peg), predicates (on, on-peg, clear, smaller, controls), and a move action parameterized by an agent, a disk, a source (disk or peg), and a destination (disk or peg) with preconditions enforcing legality (top disk only, no larger on smaller, agent controls disk, source and destination are clear) and effects updating on/clear relations. The problem should instantiate pegs left, middle, right; disks A through J with a total order via smaller facts; initial state matching the specified initial configuration; and goal matching the specified target configuration. Ensure that the action schema and objects are named consistently, avoid conditional effects, and target FastDownward defaults."

The problem should instantiate pegs left, middle, right; disks A through J with a total order via smaller facts; initial state matching the specified initial configuration; and goal matching the specified target configuration. Ensure that the action schema and objects are named consistently, avoid conditional effects, and target FastDownward defaults."

The domain should include types (agent, disk, peg), predicates (on, on-peg, clear, smaller, controls), and a move action parameterized by an agent, a disk, a source (disk or peg), and a destination (disk or peg) with preconditions enforcing legality (top disk only, no larger on smaller, agent controls disk, source and destination are clear) and effects updating on/clear relations. The problem should instantiate pegs left, middle, right; disks A through J with a total order via smaller facts; initial state matching the specified initial configuration; and goal matching the specified target configuration. Ensure that the action schema and objects are named consistently, avoid conditional effects, and target FastDownward defaults."

The domain should include types (agent, disk, peg), predicates (on, on-peg, clear, smaller, controls), and a move action parameterized by an agent, a disk, a source (disk or peg), and a destination (disk or peg) with preconditions enforcing legality (top disk only, no larger on smaller, agent controls disk, source and destination are clear) and effects updating on/clear relations. The problem should instantiate pegs left, middle, right; disks A through J with a total order via smaller facts; initial state matching the specified initial configuration; and goal matching the specified target configuration. Ensure that the action schema and objects are named consistently, avoid conditional effects, and target FastDownward defaults."
