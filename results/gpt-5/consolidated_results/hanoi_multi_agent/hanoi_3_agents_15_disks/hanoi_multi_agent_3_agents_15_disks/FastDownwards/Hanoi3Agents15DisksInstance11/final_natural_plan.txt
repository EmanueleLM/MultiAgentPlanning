Here is the human-readable sequence of actions corresponding exactly to the provided plan. All moves are by agent_1 and obey Tower of Hanoi rules and agent permissions.

1) t=00:00–00:01 (duration 1)
- agent_1 moves disk A from atop disk B on the left peg to the right peg.

2) t=00:01–00:02 (duration 1)
- agent_1 moves disk B from atop disk C on the left peg to the middle peg.

3) t=00:02–00:03 (duration 1)
- agent_1 moves disk A from the right peg onto disk B on the middle peg.

4) t=00:03–00:04 (duration 1)
- agent_1 moves disk C from atop disk D on the left peg to the right peg.

5) t=00:04–00:05 (duration 1)
- agent_1 moves disk A from atop disk B on the middle peg onto disk D on the left peg.

Resulting configuration (goal achieved):
- Left peg: A on D, then D–E–F–G–H–I–J–K–L–M–N–O down to the peg.
- Middle peg: B (clear).
- Right peg: C (clear).
