PROBLEM
------------------------------
Devise a cooperative plan for a 3-agent Tower of Hanoi with 15 disks labelled A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, O (A is the smallest, O the largest). Agents are limited to moving specific disks: agent_1 ⇒ A, B, C, D, E; agent_2 ⇒ F, G, H, I, J; agent_3 ⇒ K, L, M, N, O. Initial configuration: left peg has (top→bottom) A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, O; middle peg is empty; right peg is empty. Goal configuration: left peg has (top→bottom) B, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, O; middle peg is empty; right peg has (top→bottom) A, C. Provide an ordered list of primitive moves in the format 'agent_i: move disk X from peg1 to peg2', respecting the agent restrictions and the Tower of Hanoi rules.
