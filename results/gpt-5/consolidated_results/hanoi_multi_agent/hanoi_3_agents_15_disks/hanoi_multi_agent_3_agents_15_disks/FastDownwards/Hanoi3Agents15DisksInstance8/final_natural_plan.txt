Here is the human-readable action sequence corresponding exactly to the provided plan:

1) Timestamp s1 -> s2
- agent_1 moves disk A from left (off disk B) to the right peg (onto empty peg).

2) Timestamp s2 -> s3
- agent_1 moves disk B from left (off disk C) to the middle peg (onto empty peg).

3) Timestamp s3 -> s4
- agent_1 moves disk A from the right peg to the middle peg, placing A onto disk B.

4) Timestamp s4 -> s5
- agent_1 moves disk C from left (off disk D) to the right peg (onto empty peg).

5) Timestamp s5 -> s6
- agent_1 moves disk A from the middle peg (off disk B) to the left peg, placing A onto disk D.

6) Timestamp s6 -> s7
- agent_1 moves disk B from the middle peg to the right peg, placing B onto disk C.

7) Timestamp s7 -> s8
- agent_1 moves disk A from the left peg (off disk D) to the middle peg (onto empty peg).

Resulting configuration (matches the goal):
- Left peg: D (top) over E, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, O.
- Middle peg: A (top).
- Right peg: B (top) over C.
