Here is the ordered sequence of human-readable actions matching the plan, with timestamps and durations (each move takes 1 step):

1) t0 → t1 (duration 1): agent_1 moves disk A from disk B to the right peg.
2) t1 → t2 (duration 1): agent_1 moves disk B from disk C to the middle peg.
3) t2 → t3 (duration 1): agent_1 moves disk A from the right peg onto disk B.
4) t3 → t4 (duration 1): agent_1 moves disk C from disk D to the right peg.
5) t4 → t5 (duration 1): agent_1 moves disk A from disk B onto disk D.
6) t5 → t6 (duration 1): agent_1 moves disk B from the middle peg onto disk C.
7) t6 → t7 (duration 1): agent_1 moves disk A from disk D onto disk B.
8) t7 → t8 (duration 1): agent_1 moves disk D from disk E to the middle peg.
9) t8 → t9 (duration 1): agent_1 moves disk A from disk B onto disk D.
10) t9 → t10 (duration 1): agent_1 moves disk B from disk C onto disk E.
11) t10 → t11 (duration 1): agent_1 moves disk A from disk D onto disk B.
12) t11 → t12 (duration 1): agent_1 moves disk C from the right peg onto disk D.
13) t12 → t13 (duration 1): agent_1 moves disk A from disk B to the right peg.
14) t13 → t14 (duration 1): agent_1 moves disk B from disk E onto disk C.
15) t14 → t15 (duration 1): agent_1 moves disk A from the right peg onto disk B.

Final configuration achieved: A on B on C on D on the middle peg; disks E through T remain stacked on the left peg; right peg is empty.
