Here is the human-readable sequence of actions matching the plan. Assume each move takes 1 time unit; t denotes the start time.

1. [t=0–1] agent_1: move disk A from left to right
2. [t=1–2] agent_1: move disk B from left to middle
3. [t=2–3] agent_1: move disk A from right to middle
4. [t=3–4] agent_1: move disk C from left to right
5. [t=4–5] agent_1: move disk A from middle to left
6. [t=5–6] agent_1: move disk B from middle to right
7. [t=6–7] agent_1: move disk A from left to right
8. [t=7–8] agent_1: move disk A from right to middle
9. [t=8–9] agent_1: move disk B from right to left
10. [t=9–10] agent_1: move disk A from middle to left
11. [t=10–11] agent_1: move disk C from right to middle
12. [t=11–12] agent_1: move disk A from left to right
13. [t=12–13] agent_1: move disk B from left to middle
14. [t=13–14] agent_1: move disk A from right to middle
15. [t=14–15] agent_1: move disk D from left to right
16. [t=15–16] agent_1: move disk A from middle to left
17. [t=16–17] agent_1: move disk B from middle to right
18. [t=17–18] agent_1: move disk A from left to middle

Result: Left peg has E–T (top to bottom starting with E on top), middle peg has A on C (A on top), and right peg has B on D (B on top). Disks E–T were never moved.
