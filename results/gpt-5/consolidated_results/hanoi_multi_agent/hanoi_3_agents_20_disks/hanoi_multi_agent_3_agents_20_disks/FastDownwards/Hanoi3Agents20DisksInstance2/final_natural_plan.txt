Here is the human-readable action sequence that follows the plan exactly, with simple timestamps and 1-unit durations:

1) t=0s–1s (duration 1s) — agent_1: move disk A from disk B to the middle peg
2) t=1s–2s (duration 1s) — agent_1: move disk B from disk C to the right peg
3) t=2s–3s (duration 1s) — agent_1: move disk A from the middle peg to disk B
4) t=3s–4s (duration 1s) — agent_1: move disk C from disk D to the middle peg
5) t=4s–5s (duration 1s) — agent_1: move disk A from disk B to disk D
6) t=5s–6s (duration 1s) — agent_1: move disk B from the right peg to disk C
7) t=6s–7s (duration 1s) — agent_1: move disk A from disk D to disk B
