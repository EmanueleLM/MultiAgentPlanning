Here is the human-readable execution of the provided plan, with timestamps from the stage sequence and unit durations:

1) [s0 → s1 | duration: 1]
   agent_1: move disk A from atop disk B (on the left peg) to the right peg.

2) [s1 → s2 | duration: 1]
   agent_1: move disk B from atop disk C (on the left peg) to the middle peg.

3) [s2 → s3 | duration: 1]
   agent_1: move disk A from the right peg onto disk B (on the middle peg).

4) [s3 → s4 | duration: 1]
   agent_1: move disk C from atop disk D (on the left peg) to the right peg.

5) [s4 → s5 | duration: 1]
   agent_1: move disk A from atop disk B (middle peg) onto disk C (right peg).

Result after step 5 (s5): left peg has D..T (unchanged below), middle peg has B alone, right peg has C with A on top — goal achieved.
