Here is the human-readable execution of the plan, with timestamps and concise effects.

1) t=00:00, Δ=1
   wretched(object_4, object_7, object_8, object_2)
   Effect: Switch next(object_4, •) from object_7 to object_8.

2) t=00:01, Δ=1
   clip(object_10, object_4, object_8)
   Effect: Add vase(object_10, object_4); remove next(object_10, object_8).

3) t=00:02, Δ=1
   wretched(object_4, object_8, object_7, object_2)
   Effect: Switch next(object_4, •) from object_8 back to object_7.

4) t=00:03, Δ=1
   tightfisted(object_10, object_4, object_7)
   Effect: Add next(object_10, object_7); remove vase(object_10, object_4).

5) t=00:04, Δ=1
   wretched(object_3, object_5, object_6, object_1)
   Effect: Switch next(object_3, •) from object_5 to object_6.

6) t=00:05, Δ=1
   clip(object_11, object_3, object_6)
   Effect: Add vase(object_11, object_3); remove next(object_11, object_6).

7) t=00:06, Δ=1
   wretched(object_3, object_6, object_5, object_1)
   Effect: Switch next(object_3, •) from object_6 back to object_5.

8) t=00:07, Δ=1
   tightfisted(object_11, object_3, object_5)
   Effect: Add next(object_11, object_5); remove vase(object_11, object_3).

9) t=00:08, Δ=1
   sip(object_9, object_0, object_5)
   Effect: Add vase(object_9, object_0); remove next(object_9, object_5).

10) t=00:09, Δ=1
    sip(object_11, object_0, object_5)
    Effect: Add vase(object_11, object_0); remove next(object_11, object_5).

11) t=00:10, Δ=1
    memory(object_0, object_5, object_7)
    Effect: Switch next(object_0, •) from object_5 to object_7.

12) t=00:11, Δ=1
    paltry(object_9, object_0, object_7)
    Effect: Add next(object_9, object_7); remove vase(object_9, object_0).

13) t=00:12, Δ=1
    paltry(object_11, object_0, object_7)
    Effect: Add next(object_11, object_7); remove vase(object_11, object_0).

Result: Goals achieved — next(object_10, object_7), next(object_11, object_7), next(object_9, object_7).
