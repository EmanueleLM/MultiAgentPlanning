Execution plan to achieve goal: next object_10 object_7, next object_11 object_7, next object_12 object_7. Each step is sequential with duration Δt=1.

1) t=00:00 (Δt=1) — clip object_11 object_5 object_9
- Use hand object_11 with sneeze object_5 at textured object_9 to form a vase link; this consumes the path from object_11 to object_9.

2) t=00:01 (Δt=1) — wretched object_5 object_9 object_8 object_3
- Reroute sneeze object_5 from object_9 to object_8 using stupendous object_3 and the required collect links.

3) t=00:02 (Δt=1) — tightfisted object_11 object_5 object_8
- With the vase link between object_11 and object_5 and path object_5→object_8, establish path object_11→object_8 and drop that vase link.

4) t=00:03 (Δt=1) — clip object_12 object_4 object_6
- Use hand object_12 with sneeze object_4 at textured object_6 to form a vase link; this consumes the path from object_12 to object_6.

5) t=00:04 (Δt=1) — sip object_11 object_0 object_8
- Pair hand object_11 with cats object_0 at textured object_8 to create a vase link; this consumes the path from object_11 to object_8.

6) t=00:05 (Δt=1) — sip object_10 object_0 object_8
- Pair hand object_10 with cats object_0 at textured object_8 to create a vase link; this consumes the path from object_10 to object_8.

7) t=00:06 (Δt=1) — memory object_0 object_8 object_6
- Move cats object_0’s path from object_8 to object_6 using the spring facts.

8) t=00:07 (Δt=1) — paltry object_11 object_0 object_6
- Using the vase link (object_11, object_0) and path object_0→object_6 at textured object_6, establish path object_11→object_6 and drop that vase link.

9) t=00:08 (Δt=1) — clip object_11 object_4 object_6
- Use hand object_11 with sneeze object_4 at textured object_6 to form a vase link; this consumes the path from object_11 to object_6.

10) t=00:09 (Δt=1) — paltry object_10 object_0 object_6
- Using the vase link (object_10, object_0) and path object_0→object_6 at textured object_6, establish path object_10→object_6 and drop that vase link.

11) t=00:10 (Δt=1) — clip object_10 object_4 object_6
- Use hand object_10 with sneeze object_4 at textured object_6 to form a vase link; this consumes the path from object_10 to object_6.

12) t=00:11 (Δt=1) — wretched object_4 object_6 object_7 object_2
- Reroute sneeze object_4 from object_6 to object_7 using stupendous object_2 and the required collect links.

13) t=00:12 (Δt=1) — tightfisted object_12 object_4 object_7
- With the vase link (object_12, object_4) and path object_4→object_7 at textured object_7, establish path object_12→object_7 and drop that vase link.

14) t=00:13 (Δt=1) — tightfisted object_11 object_4 object_7
- With the vase link (object_11, object_4) and path object_4→object_7 at textured object_7, establish path object_11→object_7 and drop that vase link.

15) t=00:14 (Δt=1) — tightfisted object_10 object_4 object_7
- With the vase link (object_10, object_4) and path object_4→object_7 at textured object_7, establish path object_10→object_7 and drop that vase link.

Result: Achieves the final goal state — next object_10 object_7, next object_11 object_7, next object_12 object_7.
