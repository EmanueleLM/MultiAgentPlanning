Here is the human-readable sequence of actions that follows the provided plan exactly. Each step is sequential with unit duration and a running timestamp.

- Step 1 [t=0..1]: wretched object_3 object_6 object_7 object_1 — switch next from (object_3, object_6) to (object_3, object_7).
- Step 2 [t=1..2]: clip object_13 object_3 object_7 — create vase(object_13, object_3); remove next(object_13, object_7).
- Step 3 [t=2..3]: clip object_12 object_3 object_7 — create vase(object_12, object_3); remove next(object_12, object_7).
- Step 4 [t=3..4]: wretched object_3 object_7 object_5 object_1 — switch next from (object_3, object_7) to (object_3, object_5).
- Step 5 [t=4..5]: tightfisted object_13 object_3 object_5 — consume vase(object_13, object_3); set next(object_13, object_5).
- Step 6 [t=5..6]: tightfisted object_12 object_3 object_5 — consume vase(object_12, object_3); set next(object_12, object_5).
- Step 7 [t=6..7]: memory object_0 object_8 object_5 — switch next from (object_0, object_8) to (object_0, object_5).
- Step 8 [t=7..8]: sip object_13 object_0 object_5 — create vase(object_13, object_0); remove next(object_13, object_5).
- Step 9 [t=8..9]: sip object_12 object_0 object_5 — create vase(object_12, object_0); remove next(object_12, object_5).
- Step 10 [t=9..10]: wretched object_4 object_9 object_10 object_2 — switch next from (object_4, object_9) to (object_4, object_10).
- Step 11 [t=10..11]: clip object_11 object_4 object_10 — create vase(object_11, object_4); remove next(object_11, object_10).
- Step 12 [t=11..12]: wretched object_4 object_10 object_8 object_2 — switch next from (object_4, object_10) to (object_4, object_8).
- Step 13 [t=12..13]: tightfisted object_11 object_4 object_8 — consume vase(object_11, object_4); set next(object_11, object_8).
- Step 14 [t=13..14]: memory object_0 object_5 object_8 — switch next from (object_0, object_5) to (object_0, object_8).
- Step 15 [t=14..15]: paltry object_13 object_0 object_8 — use vase(object_13, object_0) and next(object_0, object_8) to set next(object_13, object_8); remove vase(object_13, object_0).
- Step 16 [t=15..16]: clip object_13 object_4 object_8 — create vase(object_13, object_4); remove next(object_13, object_8).
- Step 17 [t=16..17]: paltry object_12 object_0 object_8 — use vase(object_12, object_0) and next(object_0, object_8) to set next(object_12, object_8); remove vase(object_12, object_0).
- Step 18 [t=17..18]: clip object_12 object_4 object_8 — create vase(object_12, object_4); remove next(object_12, object_8).
- Step 19 [t=18..19]: wretched object_4 object_8 object_10 object_2 — switch next from (object_4, object_8) to (object_4, object_10).
- Step 20 [t=19..20]: tightfisted object_13 object_4 object_10 — consume vase(object_13, object_4); set next(object_13, object_10).
- Step 21 [t=20..21]: wretched object_4 object_10 object_9 object_2 — switch next from (object_4, object_10) to (object_4, object_9).
- Step 22 [t=21..22]: tightfisted object_12 object_4 object_9 — consume vase(object_12, object_4); set next(object_12, object_9).
- Step 23 [t=22..23]: sip object_11 object_0 object_8 — create vase(object_11, object_0); remove next(object_11, object_8).
- Step 24 [t=23..24]: memory object_0 object_8 object_5 — switch next from (object_0, object_8) to (object_0, object_5).
- Step 25 [t=24..25]: paltry object_11 object_0 object_5 — use vase(object_11, object_0) and next(object_0, object_5) to set next(object_11, object_5); remove vase(object_11, object_0).

Final goal satisfied:
- next object_11 object_5
- next object_12 object_9
- next object_13 object_10
