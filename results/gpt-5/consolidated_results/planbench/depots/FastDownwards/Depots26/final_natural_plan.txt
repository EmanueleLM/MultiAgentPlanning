Here is the human-readable action sequence that follows the provided plan exactly. Each action is listed with a timestamp window (assuming unit-duration steps of 1 minute) and a brief effect summary consistent with the domain.

- Step 1 (00:00–00:01): clip(object_13, object_4, object_7) — adds vase(object_13, object_4); deletes next(object_13, object_7).
- Step 2 (00:01–00:02): clip(object_12, object_4, object_7) — adds vase(object_12, object_4); deletes next(object_12, object_7).
- Step 3 (00:02–00:03): wretched(object_4, object_7, object_10, object_2) — adds next(object_4, object_10); deletes next(object_4, object_7).
- Step 4 (00:03–00:04): tightfisted(object_13, object_4, object_10) — adds next(object_13, object_10); deletes vase(object_13, object_4).
- Step 5 (00:04–00:05): wretched(object_4, object_9, object_11, object_3) — adds next(object_4, object_11); deletes next(object_4, object_9).
- Step 6 (00:05–00:06): wretched(object_4, object_10, object_6, object_2) — adds next(object_4, object_6); deletes next(object_4, object_10).
- Step 7 (00:06–00:07): tightfisted(object_12, object_4, object_6) — adds next(object_12, object_6); deletes vase(object_12, object_4).
- Step 8 (00:07–00:08): wretched(object_4, object_6, object_8, object_2) — adds next(object_4, object_8); deletes next(object_4, object_6).
- Step 9 (00:08–00:09): clip(object_12, object_4, object_11) — adds vase(object_12, object_4); deletes next(object_12, object_11).
- Step 10 (00:09–00:10): clip(object_14, object_4, object_8) — adds vase(object_14, object_4); deletes next(object_14, object_8).
- Step 11 (00:10–00:11): tightfisted(object_14, object_4, object_11) — adds next(object_14, object_11); deletes vase(object_14, object_4).
- Step 12 (00:11–00:12): wretched(object_4, object_8, object_9, object_2) — adds next(object_4, object_9); deletes next(object_4, object_8).
- Step 13 (00:12–00:13): tightfisted(object_12, object_4, object_9) — adds next(object_12, object_9); deletes vase(object_12, object_4).
- Step 14 (00:13–00:14): wretched(object_3, object_6, object_10, object_2) — adds next(object_3, object_10); deletes next(object_3, object_6).
- Step 15 (00:14–00:15): clip(object_11, object_3, object_10) — adds vase(object_11, object_3); deletes next(object_11, object_10).
- Step 16 (00:15–00:16): wretched(object_3, object_10, object_7, object_2) — adds next(object_3, object_7); deletes next(object_3, object_10).
- Step 17 (00:16–00:17): wretched(object_3, object_7, object_5, object_1) — adds next(object_3, object_5); deletes next(object_3, object_7).
- Step 18 (00:17–00:18): tightfisted(object_11, object_3, object_5) — adds next(object_11, object_5); deletes vase(object_11, object_3).

Result: Achieves all goals — next(object_11, object_5), next(object_12, object_9), next(object_13, object_10), next(object_12, object_6), and next(object_14, object_11).
