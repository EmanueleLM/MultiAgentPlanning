Here is the human-readable sequence of actions that follows the plan exactly and achieves the goal (next object_8 object_7) and (next object_9 object_6). Each step assumes duration = 1 time unit.

- t=0 → t=1
  Action: memory object_1 object_6 object_7
  Description: Redirect object_1’s next-link from object_6 to object_7 (using spring at both). Effect: add next(object_1, object_7); delete next(object_1, object_6).

- t=1 → t=2
  Action: sip object_9 object_1 object_7
  Description: At textured object_7, bind object_9 (in hand) with object_1 (a cat), creating vase(object_9, object_1). Effect: add vase(object_9, object_1); delete next(object_9, object_7).

- t=2 → t=3
  Action: memory object_1 object_7 object_6
  Description: Redirect object_1’s next-link back from object_7 to object_6. Effect: add next(object_1, object_6); delete next(object_1, object_7).

- t=3 → t=4
  Action: paltry object_9 object_1 object_6
  Description: Using vase(object_9, object_1) at textured object_6 and next(object_1, object_6), advance object_9 to object_6 and drop the vase link. Effect: add next(object_9, object_6); delete vase(object_9, object_1).

Result: Goal satisfied — next(object_8, object_7) remains true from the start, and next(object_9, object_6) is achieved at t=4.
