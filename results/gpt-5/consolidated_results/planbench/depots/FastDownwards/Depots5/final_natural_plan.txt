Here is the exact sequence of human-readable actions that follows the provided plan and achieves the goal next(object_9, object_7). Each step is sequential with a duration of 1 time unit.

1) t=0→1: wretched(object_3, object_5, object_6, object_1)
   - Effect: add next(object_3, object_6); delete next(object_3, object_5).

2) t=1→2: clip(object_9, object_3, object_6)
   - Effect: add vase(object_9, object_3); delete next(object_9, object_6).

3) t=2→3: wretched(object_3, object_6, object_5, object_1)
   - Effect: add next(object_3, object_5); delete next(object_3, object_6).

4) t=3→4: tightfisted(object_9, object_3, object_5)
   - Effect: add next(object_9, object_5); delete vase(object_9, object_3).

5) t=4→5: sip(object_9, object_0, object_5)
   - Effect: add vase(object_9, object_0); delete next(object_9, object_5).

6) t=5→6: memory(object_0, object_5, object_7)
   - Effect: add next(object_0, object_7); delete next(object_0, object_5).

7) t=6→7: paltry(object_9, object_0, object_7)
   - Effect: add next(object_9, object_7); delete vase(object_9, object_0).

Goal achieved: next(object_9, object_7).
