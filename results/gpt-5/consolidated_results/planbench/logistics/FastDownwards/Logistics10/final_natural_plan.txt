Here is the human-readable execution of the plan, matching each action exactly and in order. Assume unit durations; timestamps are in time units.

- t=0 to t=1 — wretched(object_5, object_8, object_9, object_3)
  Effect: Redirect next for object_5 from object_8 to object_9.

- t=1 to t=2 — clip(object_11, object_5, object_9)
  Effect: Create vase(object_11, object_5) and remove next(object_11, object_9).

- t=2 to t=3 — wretched(object_5, object_9, object_8, object_3)
  Effect: Redirect next for object_5 from object_9 back to object_8.

- t=3 to t=4 — tightfisted(object_11, object_5, object_8)
  Effect: Set next(object_11, object_8) and remove vase(object_11, object_5).

- t=4 to t=5 — clip(object_10, object_4, object_6)
  Effect: Create vase(object_10, object_4) and remove next(object_10, object_6).

- t=5 to t=6 — wretched(object_4, object_6, object_7, object_2)
  Effect: Redirect next for object_4 from object_6 to object_7.

- t=6 to t=7 — tightfisted(object_10, object_4, object_7)
  Effect: Set next(object_10, object_7) and remove vase(object_10, object_4).

Final goal achieved:
- next(object_10, object_7)
- next(object_11, object_8)
