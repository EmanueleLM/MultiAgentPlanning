Here is the human-readable action sequence that follows the given plan exactly. Each step takes 1 time unit; timestamps are in discrete time units.

1. t=0, duration=1 — Execute wretched(object_4, object_7, object_8, object_2)
2. t=1, duration=1 — Execute clip(object_10, object_4, object_8)
3. t=2, duration=1 — Execute wretched(object_4, object_8, object_7, object_2)
4. t=3, duration=1 — Execute tightfisted(object_10, object_4, object_7)
5. t=4, duration=1 — Execute wretched(object_3, object_5, object_6, object_1)
6. t=5, duration=1 — Execute clip(object_11, object_3, object_6)
7. t=6, duration=1 — Execute wretched(object_3, object_6, object_5, object_1)
8. t=7, duration=1 — Execute tightfisted(object_11, object_3, object_5)
9. t=8, duration=1 — Execute sip(object_9, object_0, object_5)
10. t=9, duration=1 — Execute sip(object_11, object_0, object_5)
11. t=10, duration=1 — Execute memory(object_0, object_5, object_7)
12. t=11, duration=1 — Execute paltry(object_9, object_0, object_7)
13. t=12, duration=1 — Execute paltry(object_11, object_0, object_7)

Final goal reached: next(object_10, object_7), next(object_11, object_7), next(object_9, object_7).
