Here is the human-readable execution of the plan, step by step. Each action takes 1 time unit.

- t=0 → t=1
  Action: wretched(object_5, object_9, object_10, object_3)
  Effects: add next(object_5, object_10); remove next(object_5, object_9)

- t=1 → t=2
  Action: clip(object_12, object_5, object_10)
  Effects: add vase(object_12, object_5); remove next(object_12, object_10)

- t=2 → t=3
  Action: wretched(object_5, object_10, object_11, object_3)
  Effects: add next(object_5, object_11); remove next(object_5, object_10)

- t=3 → t=4
  Action: tightfisted(object_12, object_5, object_11)
  Effects: add next(object_12, object_11); remove vase(object_12, object_5)
  Goal reached: next(object_12, object_11) holds.
