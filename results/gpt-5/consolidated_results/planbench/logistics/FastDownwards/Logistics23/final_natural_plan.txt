Here is the human-readable sequence matching the provided plan. Each action has unit duration (1) and sequential timestamps.

- Step 1 (t=0–1): clip(object_12, object_4, object_10)
  - Using hand object_12 and sneeze object_4 at textured object_10, create vase(object_12, object_4) and remove next(object_12, object_10).

- Step 2 (t=1–2): wretched(object_4, object_10, object_8, object_2)
  - Reroute object_4’s link from object_10 to object_8 (supported by stupendous object_2 and required collects), adding next(object_4, object_8) and removing next(object_4, object_10).

- Step 3 (t=2–3): tightfisted(object_12, object_4, object_8)
  - Using the vase tie between object_12 and object_4 and next(object_4, object_8), establish next(object_12, object_8) and remove vase(object_12, object_4).

- Step 4 (t=3–4): wretched(object_3, object_7, object_6, object_1)
  - Reroute object_3’s link from object_7 to object_6 (supported by stupendous object_1 and required collects), adding next(object_3, object_6) and removing next(object_3, object_7).

- Step 5 (t=4–5): clip(object_11, object_3, object_6)
  - Using hand object_11 and sneeze object_3 at textured object_6, create vase(object_11, object_3) and remove next(object_11, object_6).

- Step 6 (t=5–6): wretched(object_3, object_6, object_7, object_1)
  - Reroute object_3’s link back from object_6 to object_7 (supported by stupendous object_1 and required collects), adding next(object_3, object_7) and removing next(object_3, object_6).

- Step 7 (t=6–7): tightfisted(object_11, object_3, object_7)
  - Using the vase tie between object_11 and object_3 and next(object_3, object_7), establish next(object_11, object_7) and remove vase(object_11, object_3).

Final state achieved:
- next(object_12, object_8)
- next(object_11, object_7)
