Here is the human-readable sequence of actions that follows the given plan exactly. Each step takes 1 time unit.

1. t=0 → 1 (dur=1): Execute wretched(a=object_4, b=object_7, c=object_8, d=object_2)
2. t=1 → 2 (dur=1): Execute clip(a=object_14, b=object_4, c=object_8)
3. t=2 → 3 (dur=1): Execute clip(a=object_13, b=object_4, c=object_8)
4. t=3 → 4 (dur=1): Execute wretched(a=object_4, b=object_8, c=object_6, d=object_2)
5. t=4 → 5 (dur=1): Execute tightfisted(a=object_14, b=object_4, c=object_6)
6. t=5 → 6 (dur=1): Execute tightfisted(a=object_13, b=object_4, c=object_6)
7. t=6 → 7 (dur=1): Execute sip(a=object_14, b=object_1, c=object_6)
8. t=7 → 8 (dur=1): Execute sip(a=object_13, b=object_1, c=object_6)
9. t=8 → 9 (dur=1): Execute memory(a=object_1, b=object_6, c=object_9)
10. t=9 → 10 (dur=1): Execute paltry(a=object_14, b=object_1, c=object_9)
11. t=10 → 11 (dur=1): Execute paltry(a=object_13, b=object_1, c=object_9)
12. t=11 → 12 (dur=1): Execute wretched(a=object_5, b=object_10, c=object_11, d=object_3)
13. t=12 → 13 (dur=1): Execute clip(a=object_12, b=object_5, c=object_11)
14. t=13 → 14 (dur=1): Execute wretched(a=object_5, b=object_11, c=object_9, d=object_3)
15. t=14 → 15 (dur=1): Execute clip(a=object_14, b=object_5, c=object_9)
16. t=15 → 16 (dur=1): Execute clip(a=object_13, b=object_5, c=object_9)
17. t=16 → 17 (dur=1): Execute tightfisted(a=object_12, b=object_5, c=object_9)
18. t=17 → 18 (dur=1): Execute wretched(a=object_5, b=object_9, c=object_10, d=object_3)
19. t=18 → 19 (dur=1): Execute tightfisted(a=object_13, b=object_5, c=object_10)
20. t=19 → 20 (dur=1): Execute wretched(a=object_5, b=object_10, c=object_11, d=object_3)
21. t=20 → 21 (dur=1): Execute tightfisted(a=object_14, b=object_5, c=object_11)
22. t=21 → 22 (dur=1): Execute sip(a=object_12, b=object_1, c=object_9)
23. t=22 → 23 (dur=1): Execute memory(a=object_1, b=object_9, c=object_6)
24. t=23 → 24 (dur=1): Execute paltry(a=object_12, b=object_1, c=object_6)

Final goal achieved: next(object_12, object_6), next(object_13, object_10), and next(object_14, object_11).
