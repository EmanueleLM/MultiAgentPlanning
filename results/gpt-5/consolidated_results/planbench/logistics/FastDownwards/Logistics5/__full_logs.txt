------------------------------
Assumptions: unit-cost actions take 1 time unit each; timestamps are cumulative.

- Step 1 (t=0→1, duration 1): Execute sip(object_8, object_1, object_7).
  Preconditions (met): hand(object_8), cats(object_1), texture(object_7), next(object_8, object_7), next(object_1, object_7).
  Effect: add vase(object_8, object_1); delete next(object_8, object_7).

- Step 2 (t=1→2, duration 1): Execute memory(object_1, object_7, object_6).
  Preconditions (met): cats(object_1), spring(object_7), spring(object_6), next(object_1, object_7).
  Effect: add next(object_1, object_6); delete next(object_1, object_7).

- Step 3 (t=2→3, duration 1): Execute paltry(object_8, object_1, object_6).
  Preconditions (met): hand(object_8), cats(object_1), texture(object_6), vase(object_8, object_1), next(object_1, object_6).
  Effect: add next(object_8, object_6); delete vase(object_8, object_1).

Result: Goal achieved — next(object_8, object_6) holds.

NATURAL-PLAN sas_plan_1
------------------------------
Here is the human-readable execution of the plan, matching the provided actions exactly and in order. Assume each step takes duration 1 time unit.

- Step 1 (T=0, dur=1): memory object_0 object_6 object_5
  - Description: Redirect object_0’s link from object_6 to object_5 (since object_0 is cats, and both object_6 and object_5 have spring).
  - Key effect: next(object_0, object_5) becomes true; next(object_0, object_6) is removed.

- Step 2 (T=1, dur=1): sip object_8 object_0 object_5
  - Description: At textured object_5, pair hand-held object_8 with cat object_0, creating vase(object_8, object_0), using their shared next to object_5.
  - Key effect: vase(object_8, object_0) becomes true; next(object_8, object_5) is removed.

- Step 3 (T=2, dur=1): memory object_0 object_5 object_6
  - Description: Redirect object_0’s link back from object_5 to object_6 (both have spring).
  - Key effect: next(object_0, object_6) becomes true; next(object_0, object_5) is removed.

- Step 4 (T=3, dur=1): paltry object_8 object_0 object_6
  - Description: Using the vase link to object_0 and the textured object_6, establish next(object_8, object_6) and release the vase.
  - Key effect: next(object_8, object_6) becomes true; vase(object_8, object_0) is removed.

Result: The goal is satisfied — next(object_7, object_6) remained true throughout, and next(object_8, object_6) is achieved at Step 4.

[STATEMENT]
As initial conditions I have that, cats object_0, collect object_5 object_1, collect object_6 object_2, hand object_7, hand object_8, next object_0 object_6, next object_3 object_5, next object_4 object_6, next object_7 object_6, next object_8 object_5, sneeze object_3, sneeze object_4, spring object_5, spring object_6, stupendous object_1, stupendous object_2, texture object_5 and texture object_6.
My goal is to have that next object_7 object_6 and next object_8 object_6.

My plan is as follows:

memory object_0 object_6 object_5
sip object_8 object_0 object_5

FINAL-PLAN
------------------------------
I’m missing the crucial details needed to build the domain and Scenario B problem exactly as requested. Please provide:

- The original operator schemas for the six actions (paltry, sip, clip, wretched, memory, tightfisted): parameter lists, preconditions, and effects, using only the predicates cats, collect, hand, sneeze, spring, stupendous, texture, next, vase.
- The “public information for Scenario B”: the exact initial facts over objects object_0 through object_8 and the exact goal condition(s).
- Whether you expect typing (e.g., a single type like obj) or untyped objects.

Once you share these, I will return a single STRIPS PDDL domain (exactly those six actions, no extra predicates) and a matching solvable Scenario B problem, each enclosed in the requested tags.

FINAL-PLAN
------------------------------
I’m missing critical details needed to produce a valid and exact PDDL domain and two problems. To ensure the operators “match the provided operator specs exactly” and that the problems encode the “initial states and goals as provided,” please supply the following:

- Predicate signatures (arity and argument roles) for:
  hand, cats, texture, sneeze, spring, stupendous, next, vase, collect
  Example format: hand(?x - obj), next(?x - obj ?y - obj), etc.

- Operator schemas for each action:
  paltry, sip, clip, wretched, memory, tightfisted
  For each: parameter list, preconditions (including any negative preconditions), and add/delete effects. Please ensure effects are ordinary STRIPS effects (no numeric fluents, no conditional effects, no temporals).

- Two problem instances (for scenario_a and scenario_b), each with:
  - Objects: confirm the set object_0 … object_9
  - Initial facts: full list of ground atoms over the above predicates
  - Goal facts: full list of ground atoms to be achieved
  - Any hard constraints derived from preferences (e.g., “avoid X” encoded as required negative goals or state constraints representable in STRIPS)

- Any intended static relations (e.g., is next a fixed successor relation over the objects?) that should never change via action effects.

Once you provide these specifics, I will return:
- <domain>…</domain> containing domain objects_play with only :strips, :typing (and :negative-preconditions if used), the exact predicates, and the six actions with the exact preconditions/effects.
- Two problems <problem>…</problem> named scenario_a and scenario_b, each fully grounded and ready for Fast Downward.

NATURAL-PLAN sas_plan_10
------------------------------
Here is the human-readable execution sequence that follows the given plan exactly and achieves the goals:

1. [t=0–1] (sip object_8 object_0 object_6) — Establish vase(object_8, object_0) and remove next(object_8, object_6).
2. [t=1–2] (sip object_7 object_0 object_6) — Establish vase(object_7, object_0) and remove next(object_7, object_6).
3. [t=2–3] (memory object_0 object_6 object_5) — Reroute next from next(object_0, object_6) to next(object_0, object_5).
4. [t=3–4] (paltry object_8 object_0 object_5) — Establish next(object_8, object_5) and remove vase(object_8, object_0).
5. [t=4–5] (paltry object_7 object_0 object_5) — Establish next(object_7, object_5) and remove vase(object_7, object_0).

Result: Goals satisfied — next(object_8, object_5) and next(object_7, object_5).

PROBLEM
------------------------------
I am playing with a set of objects. Here are the actions I can do

Paltry object_0 object_1 object_2.
Sip object_0 object_1 object_2.
Clip object_0 object_1 object_2.
Wretched object_0 object_1 object_2 object_3.
Memory object_0 object_1 object_2.
Tightfisted object_0 object_1 object_2.

I have the following restrictions on my actions:
To perform paltry action, the following facts need to be true: hand object_0, cats object_1, texture object_2, vase object_0 object_1, and next object_1 object_2
Once paltry is performed the following facts will be true: next object_0 object_2
Once paltry is performed the following facts will be false: vase object_0 object_1
To perform sip action, the following facts need to be true: hand object_0, cats object_1, texture object_2, next object_0 object_2, and next object_1 object_2
Once sip is performed the following facts will be true: vase object_0 object_1
Once sip is performed the following facts will be false: next object_0 object_2
To perform clip action, the following facts need to be true: hand object_0, sneeze object_1, texture object_2, next object_1 object_2, and next object_0 object_2
Once clip is performed the following facts will be true: vase object_0 object_1
Once clip is performed the following facts will be false: next object_0 object_2
To perform wretched action, the following facts need to be true: sneeze object_0, texture object_1, texture object_2, stupendous object_3, next object_0 object_1, collect object_1 object_3, and collect object_2 object_3
Once wretched is performed the following facts will be true: next object_0 object_2
Once wretched is performed the following facts will be false: next object_0 object_1
To perform memory action, the following facts need to be true: cats object_0, spring object_1, spring object_2, and next object_0 object_1

NATURAL-PLAN sas_plan_10
------------------------------
Here is the human-readable sequence of actions that follows the plan exactly and achieves the goal:

- t=0 → t=1 (duration 1): memory(object_1, object_6, object_7)
  - Reroute the next-link of object_1 from object_6 to object_7.
  - Preconditions used: cats(object_1), spring(object_6), spring(object_7), next(object_1, object_6).
  - Effects: remove next(object_1, object_6); add next(object_1, object_7).

- t=1 → t=2 (duration 1): sip(object_9, object_1, object_7)
  - Use the shared target object_7 to create a vase link between object_9 and object_1, consuming object_9’s link to object_7.
  - Preconditions used: hand(object_9), cats(object_1), texture(object_7), next(object_9, object_7), next(object_1, object_7).
  - Effects: remove next(object_9, object_7); add vase(object_9, object_1).

- t=2 → t=3 (duration 1): memory(object_1, object_7, object_6)
  - Restore the next-link of object_1 back from object_7 to object_6.
  - Preconditions used: cats(object_1), spring(object_7), spring(object_6), next(object_1, object_7).
  - Effects: remove next(object_1, object_7); add next(object_1, object_6).

- t=3 → t=4 (duration 1): paltry(object_9, object_1, object_6)
  - Consume the vase link to establish next(object_9, object_6).
  - Preconditions used: hand(object_9), cats(object_1), texture(object_6), vase(object_9, object_1), next(object_1, object_6).
  - Effects: add next(object_9, object_6); remove vase(object_9, object_1).

Final state: 
- next(object_8, object_7) remains true throughout.
- next(object_9, object_6) is achieved at t=4.
Goal satisfied. Total cost: 4; makespan: 4.

PROBLEM
------------------------------
I am playing with a set of objects. Here are the actions I can do

Paltry object_0 object_1 object_2.
Sip object_0 object_1 object_2.
Clip object_0 object_1 object_2.
Wretched object_0 object_1 object_2 object_3.
Memory object_0 object_1 object_2.
Tightfisted object_0 object_1 object_2.

I have the following restrictions on my actions:
To perform paltry action, the following facts need to be true: hand object_0, cats object_1, texture object_2, vase object_0 object_1, and next object_1 object_2
Once paltry is performed the following facts will be true: next object_0 object_2
Once paltry is performed the following facts will be false: vase object_0 object_1
To perform sip action, the following facts need to be true: hand object_0, cats object_1, texture object_2, next object_0 object_2, and next object_1 object_2
Once sip is performed the following facts will be true: vase object_0 object_1
Once sip is performed the following facts will be false: next object_0 object_2
To perform clip action, the following facts need to be true: hand object_0, sneeze object_1, texture object_2, next object_1 object_2, and next object_0 object_2

NATURAL-PLAN sas_plan_1
------------------------------
Human-readable action sequence (timestamps in unit-time; each step duration = 1)

1) t=0, dur=1 — wretched(w=object_3, x=object_5, y=object_6, z=object_1)
   Redirect object_3’s next from object_5 to object_6 (adds next(object_3, object_6), removes next(object_3, object_5)).

2) t=1, dur=1 — clip(x=object_9, y=object_3, z=object_6)
   At location object_6, bind object_9 to object_3 by creating vase(object_9, object_3); remove next(object_9, object_6).

3) t=2, dur=1 — wretched(w=object_3, x=object_6, y=object_5, z=object_1)
   Redirect object_3’s next back from object_6 to object_5 (adds next(object_3, object_5), removes next(object_3, object_6)).

4) t=3, dur=1 — tightfisted(x=object_9, y=object_3, z=object_5)
   Using vase(object_9, object_3) and next(object_3, object_5), set next(object_9, object_5); remove vase(object_9, object_3).

5) t=4, dur=1 — sip(x=object_9, y=object_0, z=object_5)
   At location object_5, create vase(object_9, object_0); remove next(object_9, object_5).

6) t=5, dur=1 — memory(x=object_0, y=object_5, z=object_7)
   Move object_0’s next from object_5 to object_7 (adds next(object_0, object_7), removes next(object_0, object_5)).

7) t=6, dur=1 — paltry(x=object_9, y=object_0, z=object_7)
   Using vase(object_9, object_0) and next(object_0, object_7), set next(object_9, object_7); remove vase(object_9, object_0).

Result: Goal achieved — next(object_9, object_7).
