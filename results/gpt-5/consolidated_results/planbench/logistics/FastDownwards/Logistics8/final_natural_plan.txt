Here is the human-readable sequence that follows the provided plan exactly and achieves the goal:

1) t=0 → 1 (duration: 1)
   Action: clip(object_9, object_4, object_8)
   Effects: add vase(object_9, object_4); delete next(object_9, object_8)

2) t=1 → 2 (duration: 1)
   Action: wretched(object_4, object_8, object_7, object_2)
   Effects: add next(object_4, object_7); delete next(object_4, object_8)

3) t=2 → 3 (duration: 1)
   Action: tightfisted(object_9, object_4, object_7)
   Effects: add next(object_9, object_7); delete vase(object_9, object_4)

Final state note: next(object_10, object_5) remains true from the start, and next(object_9, object_7) is achieved by step 3. Goal satisfied.
