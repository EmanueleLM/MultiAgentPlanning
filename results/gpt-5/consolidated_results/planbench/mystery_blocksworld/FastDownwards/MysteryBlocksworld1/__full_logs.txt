NATURAL-PLAN sas_plan_1
------------------------------
Here is the human-readable execution of the plan:

1) Time 0s–1s: Execute sip(object_8, object_1, object_7)
   - Preconditions used: hand(object_8), cats(object_1), texture(object_7), next(object_8, object_7), next(object_1, object_7)
   - Effects: add vase(object_8, object_1); delete next(object_8, object_7)

2) Time 1s–2s: Execute memory(object_1, object_7, object_6)
   - Preconditions used: cats(object_1), spring(object_7), spring(object_6), next(object_1, object_7)
   - Effects: add next(object_1, object_6); delete next(object_1, object_7)

3) Time 2s–3s: Execute paltry(object_8, object_1, object_6)
   - Preconditions used: hand(object_8), cats(object_1), texture(object_6), vase(object_8, object_1), next(object_1, object_6)
   - Effects: add next(object_8, object_6); delete vase(object_8, object_1)

Goal achieved: next(object_8, object_6) holds after step 3. Total duration: 3s.

PROBLEM
------------------------------
I am playing with a set of objects. Here are the actions I can do

Paltry object_0 object_1 object_2.
Sip object_0 object_1 object_2.
Clip object_0 object_1 object_2.
Wretched object_0 object_1 object_2 object_3.
Memory object_0 object_1 object_2.
Tightfisted object_0 object_1 object_2.

I have the following restrictions on my actions:
To perform paltry action, the following facts need to be true: hand object_0, cats object_1, texture object_2, vase object_0 object_1, and next object_1 object_2
Once paltry is performed the following facts will be true: next object_0 object_2
Once paltry is performed the following facts will be false: vase object_0 object_1
To perform sip action, the following facts need to be true: hand object_0, cats object_1, texture object_2, next object_0 object_2, and next object_1 object_2
Once sip is performed the following facts will be true: vase object_0 object_1
Once sip is performed the following facts will be false: next object_0 object_2
To perform clip action, the following facts need to be true: hand object_0, sneeze object_1, texture object_2, next object_1 object_2, and next object_0 object_2
Once clip is performed the following facts will be true: vase object_0 object_1
Once clip is performed the following facts will be false: next object_0 object_2
To perform wretched action, the following facts need to be true: sneeze object_0, texture object_1, texture object_2, stupendous object_3, next object_0 object_1, collect object_1 object_3, and collect object_2 object_3
Once wretched is performed the following facts will be true: next object_0 object_2

NATURAL-PLAN sas_plan_1
------------------------------
Here is the human-readable action sequence that follows the given plan exactly and achieves the goal (timestamps in unit steps; each action duration = 1):

- t=0, duration=1: memory(object_0, object_6, object_5)
  - Update the relation for object_0: switch next(object_0, object_6) to next(object_0, object_5).

- t=1, duration=1: sip(object_8, object_0, object_5)
  - Create vase(object_8, object_0) and remove next(object_8, object_5).

- t=2, duration=1: memory(object_0, object_5, object_6)
  - Restore the relation for object_0: switch next(object_0, object_5) back to next(object_0, object_6).

- t=3, duration=1: paltry(object_8, object_0, object_6)
  - Establish next(object_8, object_6) and remove vase(object_8, object_0).

Result: Both goal facts hold — next(object_7, object_6) (already true initially) and next(object_8, object_6) (achieved at t=3). Total cost: 4.
