Here is the human-readable execution of the plan, matching the provided action sequence exactly. Each step has unit duration and sequential timestamps.

1) t=0, duration=1 — wretched(object_4, object_7, object_8, object_2)
   Effect: next(object_4, object_8) added; next(object_4, object_7) removed.

2) t=1, duration=1 — clip(object_9, object_4, object_8)
   Effect: vase(object_9, object_4) added; next(object_9, object_8) removed.

3) t=2, duration=1 — sip(object_11, object_0, object_5)
   Effect: vase(object_11, object_0) added; next(object_11, object_5) removed.

4) t=3, duration=1 — sip(object_10, object_0, object_5)
   Effect: vase(object_10, object_0) added; next(object_10, object_5) removed.

5) t=4, duration=1 — wretched(object_4, object_8, object_7, object_2)
   Effect: next(object_4, object_7) added; next(object_4, object_8) removed.

6) t=5, duration=1 — tightfisted(object_9, object_4, object_7)
   Effect: next(object_9, object_7) added; vase(object_9, object_4) removed.

7) t=6, duration=1 — wretched(object_3, object_6, object_5, object_1)
   Effect: next(object_3, object_5) added; next(object_3, object_6) removed.

8) t=7, duration=1 — memory(object_0, object_5, object_7)
   Effect: next(object_0, object_7) added; next(object_0, object_5) removed.

9) t=8, duration=1 — sip(object_9, object_0, object_7)
   Effect: vase(object_9, object_0) added; next(object_9, object_7) removed.

10) t=9, duration=1 — paltry(object_11, object_0, object_7)
    Effect: next(object_11, object_7) added; vase(object_11, object_0) removed.

11) t=10, duration=1 — paltry(object_10, object_0, object_7)
    Effect: next(object_10, object_7) added; vase(object_10, object_0) removed.

12) t=11, duration=1 — clip(object_10, object_4, object_7)
    Effect: vase(object_10, object_4) added; next(object_10, object_7) removed.

13) t=12, duration=1 — wretched(object_4, object_7, object_8, object_2)
    Effect: next(object_4, object_8) added; next(object_4, object_7) removed.

14) t=13, duration=1 — tightfisted(object_10, object_4, object_8)
    Effect: next(object_10, object_8) added; vase(object_10, object_4) removed.

15) t=14, duration=1 — memory(object_0, object_7, object_5)
    Effect: next(object_0, object_5) added; next(object_0, object_7) removed.

16) t=15, duration=1 — paltry(object_9, object_0, object_5)
    Effect: next(object_9, object_5) added; vase(object_9, object_0) removed.

17) t=16, duration=1 — clip(object_9, object_3, object_5)
    Effect: vase(object_9, object_3) added; next(object_9, object_5) removed.

18) t=17, duration=1 — wretched(object_3, object_5, object_6, object_1)
    Effect: next(object_3, object_6) added; next(object_3, object_5) removed.
