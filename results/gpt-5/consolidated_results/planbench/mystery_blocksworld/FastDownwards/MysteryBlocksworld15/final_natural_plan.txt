Here is a clear, human-readable execution trace that follows the provided plan exactly. Each step lists the action, its parameters, and its effects. Timestamps use unit-duration steps (duration = 1).

1) t=0, duration=1 — clip(object_9, object_4, object_8)
- Effect: add vase(object_9, object_4); delete next(object_9, object_8)

2) t=1, duration=1 — clip(object_11, object_4, object_8)
- Effect: add vase(object_11, object_4); delete next(object_11, object_8)

3) t=2, duration=1 — sip(object_12, object_0, object_5)
- Effect: add vase(object_12, object_0); delete next(object_12, object_5)

4) t=3, duration=1 — wretched(object_4, object_8, object_7, object_2)
- Effect: add next(object_4, object_7); delete next(object_4, object_8)

5) t=4, duration=1 — tightfisted(object_9, object_4, object_7)
- Effect: add next(object_9, object_7); delete vase(object_9, object_4)

6) t=5, duration=1 — tightfisted(object_11, object_4, object_7)
- Effect: add next(object_11, object_7); delete vase(object_11, object_4)

7) t=6, duration=1 — clip(object_10, object_4, object_7)
- Effect: add vase(object_10, object_4); delete next(object_10, object_7)

8) t=7, duration=1 — wretched(object_3, object_6, object_5, object_1)
- Effect: add next(object_3, object_5); delete next(object_3, object_6)

9) t=8, duration=1 — memory(object_0, object_5, object_7)
- Effect: add next(object_0, object_7); delete next(object_0, object_5)

10) t=9, duration=1 — sip(object_9, object_0, object_7)
- Effect: add vase(object_9, object_0); delete next(object_9, object_7)

11) t=10, duration=1 — paltry(object_12, object_0, object_7)
- Effect: add next(object_12, object_7); delete vase(object_12, object_0)

12) t=11, duration=1 — clip(object_12, object_4, object_7)
- Effect: add vase(object_12, object_4); delete next(object_12, object_7)

13) t=12, duration=1 — wretched(object_4, object_7, object_8, object_2)
- Effect: add next(object_4, object_8); delete next(object_4, object_7)

14) t=13, duration=1 — tightfisted(object_12, object_4, object_8)
- Effect: add next(object_12, object_8); delete vase(object_12, object_4)

15) t=14, duration=1 — tightfisted(object_10, object_4, object_8)
- Effect: add next(object_10, object_8); delete vase(object_10, object_4)

16) t=15, duration=1 — sip(object_11, object_0, object_7)
- Effect: add vase(object_11, object_0); delete next(object_11, object_7)

17) t=16, duration=1 — memory(object_0, object_7, object_5)
- Effect: add next(object_0, object_5); delete next(object_0, object_7)

18) t=17, duration=1 — paltry(object_9, object_0, object_5)
- Effect: add next(object_9, object_5); delete vase(object_9, object_0)

19) t=18, duration=1 — paltry(object_11, object_0, object_5)
- Effect: add next(object_11, object_5); delete vase(object_11, object_0)

20) t=19, duration=1 — clip(object_11, object_3, object_5)
- Effect: add vase(object_11, object_3); delete next(object_11, object_5)

21) t=20, duration=1 — wretched(object_3, object_5, object_6, object_1)
- Effect: add next(object_3, object_6); delete next(object_3, object_5)

22) t=21, duration=1 — tightfisted(object_11, object_3, object_6)
- Effect: add next(object_11, object_6); delete vase(object_11, object_3)

Final goal achieved:
- next(object_10, object_8)
- next(object_11, object_6)
- next(object_12, object_8)
- next(object_9, object_5)
