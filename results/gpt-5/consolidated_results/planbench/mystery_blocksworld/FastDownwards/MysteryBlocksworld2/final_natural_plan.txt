Here is the human-readable action sequence that follows the provided plan exactly and achieves the goal:

1) [t=00:00 | duration=1 (unit)]
   Execute: memory object_0 object_6 object_5
   Effect highlight: replace next(object_0, object_6) with next(object_0, object_5).

2) [t=00:01 | duration=1 (unit)]
   Execute: sip object_8 object_0 object_5
   Effect highlight: add vase(object_8, object_0); remove next(object_8, object_5).

3) [t=00:02 | duration=1 (unit)]
   Execute: memory object_0 object_5 object_6
   Effect highlight: replace next(object_0, object_5) with next(object_0, object_6).

4) [t=00:03 | duration=1 (unit)]
   Execute: paltry object_8 object_0 object_6
   Effect highlight: add next(object_8, object_6); remove vase(object_8, object_0).

Total cost: 4 (unit cost)
Goal achieved: next(object_7, object_6) and next(object_8, object_6).
