Here is the human-readable sequence of actions that follows the given plan exactly. Each step lists the timestamp (t), a nominal duration of 1 time unit, and a brief effect summary.

1) t=0, duration=1 — wretched(object_5, object_10, object_11, object_3)
   Effect: add next(object_5, object_11); remove next(object_5, object_10).

2) t=1, duration=1 — clip(object_12, object_5, object_11)
   Effect: add vase(object_12, object_5); remove next(object_12, object_11).

3) t=2, duration=1 — wretched(object_5, object_11, object_10, object_3)
   Effect: add next(object_5, object_10); remove next(object_5, object_11).

4) t=3, duration=1 — tightfisted(object_12, object_5, object_10)
   Effect: add next(object_12, object_10); remove vase(object_12, object_5).

5) t=4, duration=1 — wretched(object_5, object_10, object_9, object_3)
   Effect: add next(object_5, object_9); remove next(object_5, object_10).

6) t=5, duration=1 — wretched(object_4, object_7, object_8, object_2)
