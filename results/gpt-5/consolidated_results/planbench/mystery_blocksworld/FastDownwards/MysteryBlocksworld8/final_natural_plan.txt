Here is the human-readable sequence of actions following the given plan exactly. Each step includes a timestamp and a nominal duration of 1 time unit.

- Step 1 (t=00:00, duration=1): clip object_9 object_3 object_5
  - Effect: create vase(object_9, object_3); remove next(object_9, object_5).

- Step 2 (t=00:01, duration=1): clip object_10 object_3 object_5
  - Effect: create vase(object_10, object_3); remove next(object_10, object_5).

- Step 3 (t=00:02, duration=1): wretched object_3 object_5 object_6 object_1
  - Effect: create next(object_3, object_6); remove next(object_3, object_5).

- Step 4 (t=00:03, duration=1): tightfisted object_9 object_3 object_6
  - Effect: create next(object_9, object_6); remove vase(object_9, object_3).

- Step 5 (t=00:04, duration=1): tightfisted object_10 object_3 object_6
  - Effect: create next(object_10, object_6); remove vase(object_10, object_3).

Goal reached: next(object_10, object_6) and next(object_9, object_6).
