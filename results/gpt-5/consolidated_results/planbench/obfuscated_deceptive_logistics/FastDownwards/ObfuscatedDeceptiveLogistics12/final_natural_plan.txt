Here is the human-readable execution trace that follows the plan exactly and achieves the goal (next object_10 object_7, next object_11 object_9, next object_12 object_8). Each step uses unit time; timestamps increase by 1.

- T+00 (dur=1): WRETCHED(o0=object_5, o1=object_8, o2=object_9, o3=object_3) — Switch object_5’s adjacency from object_8 to object_9 (via stupendous object_3 and valid collects).
- T+01 (dur=1): CLIP(o0=object_10, o1=object_5, o2=object_9) — Couple hand object_10 with sneezer object_5 at location object_9 (create vase(10,5), drop next(10,9)).
- T+02 (dur=1): WRETCHED(o0=object_4, o1=object_7, o2=object_6, o3=object_2) — Switch object_4’s adjacency from object_7 to object_6 (via stupendous object_2 and valid collects).
- T+03 (dur=1): SIP(o0=object_12, o1=object_0, o2=object_6) — Couple hand object_12 with cat object_0 at location object_6 (create vase(12,0), drop next(12,6)).
- T+04 (dur=1): SIP(o0=object_11, o1=object_0, o2=object_6) — Couple hand object_11 with cat object_0 at location object_6 (create vase(11,0), drop next(11,6)).
- T+05 (dur=1): WRETCHED(o0=object_5, o1=object_9, o2=object_8, o3=object_3) — Switch object_5’s adjacency from object_9 back to object_8 (via stupendous object_3 and valid collects).
- T+06 (dur=1): TIGHTFISTED(o0=object_10, o1=object_5, o2=object_8) — Move hand object_10 with sneezer object_5 to object_8 and release (add next(10,8), delete vase(10,5)).
- T+07 (dur=1): SIP(o0=object_10, o1=object_1, o2=object_8) — Couple hand object_10 with cat object_1 at location object_8 (create vase(10,1), drop next(10,8)).
- T+08 (dur=1): MEMORY(o0=object_1, o1=object_8, o2=object_6) — Repoint cat object_1’s adjacency from object_8 to object_6.
- T+09 (dur=1): PALTRY(o0=object_10, o1=object_1, o2=object_6) — Move hand object_10 (with cat object_1) to object_6 and release (add next(10,6), delete vase(10,1)).
- T+10 (dur=1): CLIP(o0=object_10, o1=object_4, o2=object_6) — Couple hand object_10 with sneezer object_4 at location object_6 (create vase(10,4), drop next(10,6)).
- T+11 (dur=1): WRETCHED(o0=object_4, o1=object_6, o2=object_7, o3=object_2) — Switch object_4’s adjacency from object_6 to object_7 (via stupendous object_2 and valid collects).
- T+12 (dur=1): TIGHTFISTED(o0=object_10, o1=object_4, o2=object_7) — Move hand object_10 with sneezer object_4 to object_7 and release (add next(10,7), delete vase(10,4)).
- T+13 (dur=1): MEMORY(o0=object_0, o1=object_6, o2=object_8) — Repoint cat object_0’s adjacency from object_6 to object_8.
- T+14 (dur=1): PALTRY(o0=object_12, o1=object_0, o2=object_8) — Move hand object_12 (with cat object_0) to object_8 and release (add next(12,8), delete vase(12,0)).
- T+15 (dur=1): PALTRY(o0=object_11, o1=object_0, o2=object_8) — Move hand object_11 (with cat object_0) to object_8 and release (add next(11,8), delete vase(11,0)).
- T+16 (dur=1): CLIP(o0=object_11, o1=object_5, o2=object_8) — Couple hand object_11 with sneezer object_5 at location object_8 (create vase(11,5), drop next(11,8)).
- T+17 (dur=1): WRETCHED(o0=object_5, o1=object_8, o2=object_9, o3=object_3) — Switch object_5’s adjacency from object_8 to object_9 (via stupendous object_3 and valid collects).
- T+18 (dur=1): TIGHTFISTED(o0=object_11, o1=object_5, o2=object_9) — Move hand object_11 with sneezer object_5 to object_9 and release (add next(11,9), delete vase(11,5)).

Result: Achieved
- next(object_10, object_7)
- next(object_11, object_9)
- next(object_12, object_8)
