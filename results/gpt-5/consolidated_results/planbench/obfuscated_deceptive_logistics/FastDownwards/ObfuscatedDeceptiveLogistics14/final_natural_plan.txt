Here is the human-readable execution of the plan, matching the provided sequence exactly. Each step includes a timestamp and a 1-unit duration.

1) t=0–1 (dur=1): clip object_10 object_4 object_8 => add vase object_10 object_4; del next object_10 object_8
2) t=1–2 (dur=1): wretched object_4 object_8 object_7 object_2 => add next object_4 object_7; del next object_4 object_8
3) t=2–3 (dur=1): tightfisted object_10 object_4 object_7 => add next object_10 object_7; del vase object_10 object_4
4) t=3–4 (dur=1): wretched object_3 object_5 object_6 object_1 => add next object_3 object_6; del next object_3 object_5
5) t=4–5 (dur=1): clip object_12 object_3 object_6 => add vase object_12 object_3; del next object_12 object_6
6) t=5–6 (dur=1): sip object_9 object_0 object_7 => add vase object_9 object_0; del next object_9 object_7
7) t=6–7 (dur=1): sip object_10 object_0 object_7 => add vase object_10 object_0; del next object_10 object_7
8) t=7–8 (dur=1): memory object_0 object_7 object_5 => add next object_0 object_5; del next object_0 object_7
9) t=8–9 (dur=1): paltry object_9 object_0 object_5 => add next object_9 object_5; del vase object_9 object_0
10) t=9–10 (dur=1): sip object_11 object_0 object_5 => add vase object_11 object_0; del next object_11 object_5
11) t=10–11 (dur=1): paltry object_10 object_0 object_5 => add next object_10 object_5; del vase object_10 object_0
12) t=11–12 (dur=1): wretched object_3 object_6 object_5 object_1 => add next object_3 object_5; del next object_3 object_6
13) t=12–13 (dur=1): clip object_9 object_3 object_5 => add vase object_9 object_3; del next object_9 object_5
14) t=13–14 (dur=1): tightfisted object_12 object_3 object_5 => add next object_12 object_5; del vase object_12 object_3
15) t=14–15 (dur=1): clip object_10 object_3 object_5 => add vase object_10 object_3; del next object_10 object_5
16) t=15–16 (dur=1): wretched object_3 object_5 object_6 object_1 => add next object_3 object_6; del next object_3 object_5
17) t=16–17 (dur=1): tightfisted object_9 object_3 object_6 => add next object_9 object_6; del vase object_9 object_3
18) t=17–18 (dur=1): tightfisted object_10 object_3 object_6 => add next object_10 object_6; del vase object_10 object_3
19) t=18–19 (dur=1): sip object_12 object_0 object_5 => add vase object_12 object_0; del next object_12 object_5
20) t=19–20 (dur=1): memory object_0 object_5 object_7 => add next object_0 object_7; del next object_0 object_5
21) t=20–21 (dur=1): paltry object_12 object_0 object_7 => add next object_12 object_7; del vase object_12 object_0
22) t=21–22 (dur=1): paltry object_11 object_0 object_7 => add next object_11 object_7; del vase object_11 object_0

Final goals achieved:
- next object_10 object_6
- next object_11 object_7
