Here is the human-readable version of the given plan. Each step lists the action name and its parameters exactly as in the plan, with a short description and a unit-time schedule (1 time unit per action).

1) t=0–1
- Action: clip object_11 object_5 object_9
- What it does: Using object_11 with object_5 at relation to object_9, create a vase link between object_11 and object_5, removing next(object_11, object_9).

2) t=1–2
- Action: wretched object_5 object_9 object_8 object_3
- What it does: Redirect object_5’s relation from next(object_5, object_9) to next(object_5, object_8) using the stupendous hub object_3 and the required collections.

3) t=2–3
- Action: tightfisted object_11 object_5 object_8
- What it does: From the vase(object_11, object_5) and next(object_5, object_8), establish next(object_11, object_8) and remove the vase link.

4) t=3–4
- Action: clip object_10 object_4 object_7
- What it does: Using object_10 with object_4 at relation to object_7, create vase(object_10, object_4), removing next(object_10, object_7).

5) t=4–5
- Action: sip object_12 object_1 object_8
- What it does: With object_12 and object_1 both related to object_8, create vase(object_12, object_1) and remove next(object_12, object_8).

6) t=5–6
- Action: memory object_1 object_8 object_6
- What it does: Shift object_1’s relation from next(object_1, object_8) to next(object_1, object_6) using spring objects 8 and 6.

7) t=6–7
- Action: wretched object_4 object_7 object_6 object_2
- What it does: Redirect object_4’s relation from next(object_4, object_7) to next(object_4, object_6) using stupendous object_2 and the required collections.

8) t=7–8
- Action: tightfisted object_10 object_4 object_6
- What it does: From vase(object_10, object_4) and next(object_4, object_6), establish next(object_10, object_6) and remove the vase link.

9) t=8–9
- Action: paltry object_12 object_1 object_6
- What it does: Using the vase(object_12, object_1) and next(object_1, object_6), establish next(object_12, object_6) and remove the vase link.

10) t=9–10
- Action: clip object_12 object_4 object_6
- What it does: With object_12 and object_4 both related to object_6, create vase(object_12, object_4), removing next(object_12, object_6).

11) t=10–11
- Action: wretched object_4 object_6 object_7 object_2
- What it does: Redirect object_4’s relation from next(object_4, object_6) back to next(object_4, object_7) using stupendous object_2.

12) t=11–12
- Action: tightfisted object_12 object_4 object_7
- What it does: From vase(object_12, object_4) and next(object_4, object_7), establish next(object_12, object_7) and remove the vase link.

Final goals satisfied at t=12:
- next(object_10, object_6)
- next(object_11, object_8)
- next(object_12, object_7)
- next(object_13, object_9) (this one was already true initially and remains true)
