Here is the human-readable execution of the plan, following the given action sequence exactly. Each step takes 1 time unit.

1) t=0–1 (duration 1): wretched object_3 object_7 object_6 object_1
   - Re-route next for object_3 from object_7 to object_6 (using stupendous object_1 and required collects).

2) t=1–2 (duration 1): clip object_11 object_3 object_6
   - Form vase(object_11, object_3) at texture object_6; remove next(object_11, object_6).

3) t=2–3 (duration 1): wretched object_3 object_6 object_5 object_1
   - Re-route next for object_3 from object_6 to object_5 (using stupendous object_1 and required collects).

4) t=3–4 (duration 1): tightfisted object_11 object_3 object_5
   - Use vase(object_11, object_3) and next(object_3, object_5) to set next(object_11, object_5); remove vase(object_11, object_3).

5) t=4–5 (duration 1): memory object_0 object_8 object_5
   - Move next for cats object_0 from object_8 to object_5.

6) t=5–6 (duration 1): sip object_11 object_0 object_5
   - Create vase(object_11, object_0) via shared next(..., object_5); remove next(object_11, object_5).

7) t=6–7 (duration 1): memory object_0 object_5 object_8
   - Move next for cats object_0 from object_5 back to object_8.

8) t=7–8 (duration 1): paltry object_11 object_0 object_8
   - Use vase(object_11, object_0) and next(object_0, object_8) to set next(object_11, object_8); remove vase(object_11, object_0).

9) t=8–9 (duration 1): clip object_11 object_4 object_8
   - Form vase(object_11, object_4) at texture object_8; remove next(object_11, object_8).

10) t=9–10 (duration 1): wretched object_4 object_8 object_10 object_2
    - Re-route next for object_4 from object_8 to object_10 (using stupendous object_2 and required collects).

11) t=10–11 (duration 1): tightfisted object_11 object_4 object_10
    - Use vase(object_11, object_4) and next(object_4, object_10) to set next(object_11, object_10); remove vase(object_11, object_4).

Goal achieved: next(object_11, object_10).
