Here is the human-readable execution of the given plan, following the actions exactly and in order.

- t=0, duration=1
  Action: memory(object_0, object_6, object_5)
  Description: Redirect object_0’s next-link from object_6 to object_5.
  Effects: add next(object_0, object_5); delete next(object_0, object_6)

- t=1, duration=1
  Action: sip(object_8, object_0, object_5)
  Description: Using object_5 as the textured hub shared by object_8 and object_0, bind them with a vase relation and release object_8’s link to object_5.
  Effects: add vase(object_8, object_0); delete next(object_8, object_5)

- t=2, duration=1
  Action: memory(object_0, object_5, object_6)
  Description: Redirect object_0’s next-link back from object_5 to object_6.
  Effects: add next(object_0, object_6); delete next(object_0, object_5)

- t=3, duration=1
  Action: paltry(object_8, object_0, object_6)
  Description: Using the vase relation between object_8 and object_0 and the texture at object_6, establish object_8’s next-link to object_6 and remove the vase.
  Effects: add next(object_8, object_6); delete vase(object_8, object_0)

Result: Goal achieved — next(object_7, object_6) remains true and next(object_8, object_6) is established.
