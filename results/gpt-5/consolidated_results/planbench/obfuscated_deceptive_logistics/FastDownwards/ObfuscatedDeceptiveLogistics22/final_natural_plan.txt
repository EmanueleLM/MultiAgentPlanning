Human-readable action sequence (Scenario B), following the given plan exactly. Each step uses unit duration and sequential timestamps.

t=0 to t=1: clip(object_12, object_4, object_10)
- State change: +vase(object_12, object_4); -next(object_12, object_10)

t=1 to t=2: wretched(object_4, object_10, object_8, object_2)
- State change: +next(object_4, object_8); -next(object_4, object_10)

t=2 to t=3: tightfisted(object_12, object_4, object_8)
- State change: +next(object_12, object_8); -vase(object_12, object_4)

t=3 to t=4: wretched(object_3, object_7, object_6, object_1)
- State change: +next(object_3, object_6); -next(object_3, object_7)

t=4 to t=5: clip(object_11, object_3, object_6)
- State change: +vase(object_11, object_3); -next(object_11, object_6)

t=5 to t=6: wretched(object_3, object_6, object_7, object_1)
- State change: +next(object_3, object_7); -next(object_3, object_6)

t=6 to t=7: tightfisted(object_11, object_3, object_7)
- State change: +next(object_11, object_7); -vase(object_11, object_3)

Result: Goal achieved — next(object_11, object_7) and next(object_12, object_8).
