Here is the human-readable sequence that follows the given plan exactly. Assume unit-duration actions; timestamps indicate start..end.

1. t=0..1: clip x=object_12, y=object_4, z=object_10
   - Effect: add vase(object_12, object_4); delete next(object_12, object_10)

2. t=1..2: wretched w=object_4, x=object_10, y=object_8, z=object_2
   - Effect: add next(object_4, object_8); delete next(object_4, object_10)

3. t=2..3: tightfisted x=object_12, y=object_4, z=object_8
   - Effect: add next(object_12, object_8); delete vase(object_12, object_4)

4. t=3..4: wretched w=object_3, x=object_7, y=object_6, z=object_1
   - Effect: add next(object_3, object_6); delete next(object_3, object_7)

5. t=4..5: clip x=object_11, y=object_3, z=object_6
   - Effect: add vase(object_11, object_3); delete next(object_11, object_6)

6. t=5..6: wretched w=object_3, x=object_6, y=object_7, z=object_1
   - Effect: add next(object_3, object_7); delete next(object_3, object_6)

7. t=6..7: tightfisted x=object_11, y=object_3, z=object_7
   - Effect: add next(object_11, object_7); delete vase(object_11, object_3)

Outcome: Goal achieved with next(object_12, object_8) and next(object_11, object_7).
