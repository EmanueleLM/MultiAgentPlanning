Here is the human-readable execution of the given plan, step by step, with simple timestamps.

1) t=00:00 (Δt=1)
   clip object_9 object_3 object_5
   - Use hand-held object_9 and sneezing object_3 at textured object_5 (with next object_3 object_5 and next object_9 object_5) to create vase object_9 object_3, removing next object_9 object_5.

2) t=00:01 (Δt=1)
   clip object_10 object_3 object_5
   - Use hand-held object_10 and sneezing object_3 at textured object_5 (with next object_3 object_5 and next object_10 object_5) to create vase object_10 object_3, removing next object_10 object_5.

3) t=00:02 (Δt=1)
   wretched object_3 object_5 object_6 object_1
   - With sneeze object_3, textures at object_5 and object_6, stupendous object_1, and collected links (collect object_5 object_1 and collect object_6 object_1), shift adjacency of object_3 from object_5 to object_6: add next object_3 object_6 and delete next object_3 object_5.

4) t=00:03 (Δt=1)
   tightfisted object_9 object_3 object_6
   - Using vase object_9 object_3 and next object_3 object_6 (with texture object_6), grant next object_9 object_6 and remove vase object_9 object_3.

5) t=00:04 (Δt=1)
   tightfisted object_10 object_3 object_6
   - Using vase object_10 object_3 and next object_3 object_6 (with texture object_6), grant next object_10 object_6 and remove vase object_10 object_3.

Result: Goals achieved — next object_10 object_6 and next object_9 object_6.
