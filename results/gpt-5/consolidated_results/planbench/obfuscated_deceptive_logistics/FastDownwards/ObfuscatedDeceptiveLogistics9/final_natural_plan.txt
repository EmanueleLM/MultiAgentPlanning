- t=00:00 (Δt=1): clip(object_9, object_3, object_5) — binds object_9 to object_3 (vase object_9 object_3), removing next(object_9, object_5).
- t=00:01 (Δt=1): clip(object_10, object_3, object_5) — binds object_10 to object_3 (vase object_10 object_3), removing next(object_10, object_5).
- t=00:02 (Δt=1): wretched(object_3, object_5, object_6, object_1) — moves object_3’s adjacency from object_5 to object_6 (adds next(object_3, object_6), removes next(object_3, object_5)).
- t=00:03 (Δt=1): tightfisted(object_9, object_3, object_6) — uses the vase link to place object_9 next to object_6 (adds next(object_9, object_6), removes vase(object_9, object_3)).
- t=00:04 (Δt=1): tightfisted(object_10, object_3, object_6) — uses the vase link to place object_10 next to object_6 (adds next(object_10, object_6), removes vase(object_10, object_3)).

Result: Goal achieved — next(object_10, object_6) and next(object_9, object_6).
