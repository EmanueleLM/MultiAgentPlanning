The reachable overlaps allow creating vase object_11 object_3 (by first making next object_3 object_6 and using clip with X=6), but not vase object_11 object_4.\n- With vase object_11 object_3, tightfisted can only set next object_11 X where X is reachable from object_3 via wretched. Given the collect facts, object_3 can reach only {5,6,7}. Paltry via cats object_0 can set next object_11 to {5,8}. None yields 10.\n- There is no way to make next object_0 10 (memory requires spring on the target, and spring object_10 is absent), nor to make next object_3 10 (missing collect 10 1), nor to create vase object_11 object_4 (no overlap in reachable X between object_11 and object_4).\n\nIf you can modify the problem, any of these additions would make a plan possible:\n- Add sneeze object_11 (then wretched 11 6 10 2 would be possible after setting up collects, or other routes).\n- Add cats object_11 (memory could then set next 11 10 if spring 10 is also added).\n- Add spring object_10 (so memory can make next 0 10, enabling paltry with cats 0).\n- Add collect object_10 object_1 (so wretched can make next 3 10, enabling tightfisted via vase 11 3).\n- Start with next object_11 object_8 (then clip to make vase 11 4, wretched 4 8 10 2, tightfisted 11 4 10)."
