You arrive in the Richmond District (RD) at 9:00 AM. Travel: RD\u2192FD 22 minutes; FD\u2192RD 21 minutes.\n\nConsidered schedules\n\nOption A \u2014 Early Betty (recommended: best coverage of both neighborhoods with one cross-town hop)\n- 9:00 AM\u20134:53 PM: Meet RD friends.\n- 4:53\u20135:15 PM: Travel RD\u2192FD (22 min).\n- 5:15\u20136:15 PM: Meet Betty (60 min).\n- 6:15\u20139:45 PM: Meet FD friends.\n- 9:45\u201310:06 PM: Optional travel FD\u2192RD (21 min) if heading back.\nWhy this is best for meeting the most friends overall:\n- You get a long daytime block in RD and a full evening block in FD after Betty, enabling meets in both clusters with only one relocation and zero idle overlap inside Betty\u2019s window.\n\nOption B \u2014 Mid-window Betty (good if you must stay longer in RD)\n- 9:00 AM\u20136:38 PM: Meet RD friends.\n- 6:38\u20137:00 PM: Travel RD\u2192FD.\n- 7:00\u20138:00 PM: Meet Betty.\n- 8:00\u20139:45 PM: Meet FD friends.\nTrade-off: Longer RD time, but you lose ~2 hours of FD evening capacity, likely reducing total distinct FD meetups.\n\nOption C \u2014 Late Betty (only if almost all other friends are in RD)\n- 9:00 AM\u20138:23 PM: Meet RD friends.\n- 8:23\u20138:45 PM: Travel RD\u2192FD.\n- 8:45\u20139:45 PM: Meet Betty.\nTrade-off: Maximizes RD time but leaves virtually no time for other FD friends.\n\nRecommendation\n- Choose Option A. It preserves a substantial RD block and the maximum practical FD evening block after your guaranteed 60-minute meeting with Betty, which is the most robust way to maximize the number of different friends you can see across both neighborhoods with just one cross-town trip.\n\nNotes and small optimizations\n- If you anticipate an FD friend who can meet before 5:15 PM, depart RD earlier (e.g., 4:31 PM \u2192 arrive FD 4:53 PM) to slot a 20\u201350 minute FD meetup before Betty.\n- Add a 5-minute buffer to departure times if you want extra punctuality for Betty (e.g., leave RD at 4:50 PM instead of 4:53 PM)."

Travel between Fisherman\u2019s Wharf (FW) and Nob Hill (NH) is 11 minutes each way. You arrive at FW at 9:00 AM.\n\nCandidate schedules:\n- Option A \u2014 Early Kenneth (frees the late afternoon/evening for more meetups at FW):\n  - 9:00 AM\u20132:00 PM: Meet friends at Fisherman\u2019s Wharf.\n  - 2:00\u20132:11 PM: Travel FW \u2192 NH.\n  - 2:15\u20133:45 PM: Meet Kenneth (90 minutes).\n  - 3:45\u20133:56 PM: Travel NH \u2192 FW.\n  - 4:00\u2013evening: More meetups at Fisherman\u2019s Wharf.\n  - Pros: Maximizes two long blocks at FW (morning/early afternoon and evening), minimizing fragmentation and extra travel. Uses minimum required time with Kenneth to keep capacity for others high.\n\n- Option B \u2014 Mid-window Kenneth (splits the day, reducing throughput):\n  - 9:00 AM\u20134:19 PM: Meet friends at FW.\n  - 4:19\u20134:30 PM: Travel FW \u2192 NH.\n  - 4:30\u20136:00 PM: Meet Kenneth (90 minutes).\n  - 6:00\u20136:11 PM: Travel NH \u2192 FW (or finish day near NH).\n  - Pros: Preserves morning and a bit of evening; Cons: Cuts directly across prime evening meetup time, likely reducing the total number of friends you can see.\n\n- Option C \u2014 Late Kenneth (front-load day, little time after):\n  - 9:00 AM\u20136:04 PM: Meet friends at FW.\n  - 6:04\u20136:15 PM: Travel FW \u2192 NH.\n  - 6:15\u20137:45 PM: Meet Kenneth (90 minutes).\n  - 7:45\u20137:56 PM: Travel NH \u2192 FW (optional).\n  - Pros: Maximizes pre-Kenneth capacity; Cons: Little/no time for post-dinner meetups, and any delays risk cutting into Kenneth\u2019s hard end time.\n\nBest choice: Option A. It achieves the required 90-minute meeting with Kenneth and creates the largest continuous blocks for other friend meetups (late morning through early afternoon at FW, then again from ~4:00 PM through the evening), which typically yields the highest total count of meetups with minimal extra travel.\n\nFinal plan (Option A):\n- 9:00 AM\u20132:00 PM at Fisherman\u2019s Wharf for friend meetups.\n- 2:00\u20132:11 PM travel FW \u2192 Nob Hill.\n- 2:15\u20133:45 PM meet Kenneth (90 minutes).\n- 3:45\u20133:56 PM travel NH \u2192 Fisherman\u2019s Wharf.\n- 4:00 PM\u2013evening at Fisherman\u2019s Wharf for additional meetups.\n\nNotes:\n- Keep Kenneth\u2019s meetup to 90 minutes (the minimum) to maximize total friend slots.\n- If multiple friends end up being at/near Nob Hill in the late afternoon, switch to Option B; if most are only free late afternoon at FW, Option A remains best. If friends heavily prefer midday and you want an uninterrupted afternoon at FW, Option C can work, but expect fewer total evening meetups."

Cons: Uses nearly the whole afternoon/evening; least time for others.\n\n2) Early minimum with Ronald\n- Depart C 3:08 PM \u2192 Arrive RH 3:15 PM.\n- Meet 3:15\u20135:00 PM (105 minutes). Optional return to C by 5:09 PM.\n- Pros: Leaves evening open (about 4.5 hours before 9:30 PM). Cons: Blocks mid-afternoon.\n\n3) Late minimum with Ronald (best for meeting the most friends overall)\n- Latest arrival to still get 105 minutes: 7:45 PM (since 9:30 PM \u2212 1h45m = 7:45 PM).\n- Depart C 7:38 PM \u2192 Arrive RH 7:45 PM.\n- Meet 7:45\u20139:30 PM (105 minutes). Optional return to C by 9:39 PM.\n- Pros: Keeps the entire day (9:00 AM\u20137:38 PM) free for other friend meetups; satisfies the 105-minute requirement with Ronald. Cons: Shorter time with Ronald.\n\nRecommended plan\n- Choose Schedule 3: Leave Chinatown at 7:38 PM, arrive Russian Hill at 7:45 PM, meet Ronald until 9:30 PM (105 minutes).

    "response": "SOLUTION:\nGoal: meet as many friends as possible. Given only Matthew\u2019s availability (1:30\u20132:30 PM at Sunset District) and asymmetric travel times (Alamo Square\u2192Sunset 16 min; Sunset\u2192Alamo 17 min), the best plan is the one that satisfies a \u226515-minute meetup with minimal time blocked so the rest of the day stays open for other friends.\n\nConsidered schedules\n1) Early/max time with Matthew\n- 1:00 PM depart Alamo Square \u2192 1:16 PM arrive Sunset\n- 1:30\u20132:30 PM meet Matthew (60 min)\n- 2:30\u20132:47 PM travel back\nPros: full hour with Matthew. Cons: blocks ~1h 47m around his window; reduces opportunity to meet others.

Best for maximizing total friends.\n\n3) End-of-window (minimum time, later return)\n- 1:45 PM depart Alamo Square \u2192 2:01 PM arrive Sunset\n- 2:01\u20132:16 PM meet Matthew (15 min)\n- 2:16\u20132:33 PM travel back\nPros: Maximizes pre-2 PM availability. Cons: Leaves less late-afternoon time and higher risk if delayed. Inferior to option 2 for total-day flexibility.\n\nRecommended day plan\n- 9:00 AM: Arrive at Alamo Square.\n- 9:00 AM\u20131:14 PM: Free to meet other friends near Alamo Square.\n- 1:14\u20131:30 PM: Travel to Sunset District.\n- 1:30\u20131:45 PM: Meet Matthew (15 minutes minimum satisfied).\n- 1:45\u20132:02 PM: Travel back to Alamo Square (or onward to next meetup).\n- 2:02 PM onward: Free to meet additional friends.\n\nRationale: Option 2 maximizes the combined available time before and after Matthew\u2019s window while meeting the constraint, thus optimizing the number of possible friend meetups for the day."

    "response": "SOLUTION:\nGoal: maximize number of friend meetups while ensuring a 75+ minute meeting with Betty in Richmond between 8:30 PM and 10:00 PM. You arrive in Marina at 9:00 AM. Travel times: Marina\u2192Richmond 11 min; Richmond\u2192Marina 9 min.\n\nAssumption (to compare schedules fairly): each friend meetup (other than travel) uses a 60-minute block (roughly 45 min together + 15 min flex for transitions). If your preferred meeting length differs, I can recompute.\n\nConsidered schedules:\n1) One late transfer (Marina all day, then Richmond for evening)\n- Travel before Betty: 11 minutes total (one Marina\u2192Richmond).\n- Pre-Betty time available: 9:00 AM\u20138:30 PM = 690 minutes. 690 \u2212 11 = 679 minutes, which fits 11 full 60-minute friend blocks before 8:30.\n- Outcome: 11 friends before 8:30 + Betty (75+ min) = 12 total friends with just one cross-town move.\n\n2) Two cross-town transfers (midday Richmond block, back to Marina, then Richmond again for Betty)\n- Extra travel before Betty: +20 minutes (Richmond\u2192Marina 9 + Marina\u2192Richmond 11).\n- Pre-Betty usable time: 690 \u2212 (11 + 20) = 659 minutes = 10 full friend blocks.\n- Outcome: 10 friends before 8:30 + Betty = 11 total. Worse due to lost time in transit.\n\n3) Early transfer and stay in Richmond through evening\n- Same total pre-Betty travel as (1): 11 minutes.\n- Outcome: also 11 friends before 8:30 + Betty = 12 total. Ties (1), pick based on where most of your friends are.\n\nBest plan: One late transfer (minimizes transit, maximizes meetings)\n\nConcrete schedule (chosen):\n- 9:00 AM\u20137:00 PM: 10 back-to-back 60-min meetups in Marina (start on the hour).\n- 7:00\u20137:11 PM: Travel Marina\u2192Richmond (11 min).\n- 7:15\u20138:15 PM: 1 meetup in Richmond.\n- 8:30\u20139:45 PM: Meet Betty in Richmond (75 minutes, satisfies the minimum; you can extend to 10:00 PM for 90 minutes if you prefer).\n- Optional: 9:45\u20139:54 PM travel back to Marina (9 min) if you need to return.\n\nWhy this is optimal under the assumption:\n- It uses only one cross-town leg before Betty, maximizing the number of full meeting blocks (11) you can fit before her 8:30 PM start. Any extra cross-town moves reduce your count by at least one meeting.\n- It leaves a 15-minute margin (8:15\u20138:30) before Betty, avoiding any risk of being late.\n\nNotes:\n- If you\u2019d rather have 30- or 45-minute meetups, the same one-transfer structure still dominates; I can recalc the exact counts and times to fit your preferred meeting length."

Use 45\u201360 minute slots with short walks between. You preserve a large uninterrupted block for multiple meetings.\n- 1:58 PM: Leave Nob Hill for Presidio.\n- 2:15\u20133:00 PM: Meet Matthew (45 minutes).\n- 3:00\u20133:18 PM: Return to Nob Hill (or continue elsewhere if needed).\n- After 3:18 PM: Optional additional meetups.\n\nContingencies:\n- Running late before Matthew? Absolute latest safe departure from Nob Hill is 2:28 PM to still meet 2:45\u20133:15 for 30 minutes.\n- Running early or a friend cancels? Shift earlier: for example, depart 12:58 PM to arrive 1:15 PM and meet Matthew 1:15\u20132:00, freeing more late afternoon time.\n\nWhy this is optimal:\n- It maximizes the total number of available friend-meeting slots by keeping the entire morning and early afternoon open, while still protecting your ability to meet Matthew with a meaningful buffer in case earlier plans or transit run long."

    "response": "SOLUTION:\n- Constraints recap\n  - You arrive in Sunset District at 9:00 AM.\n  - Travel time Sunset \u21c4 Haight-Ashbury: 15 minutes each way.\n  - Nancy is at Haight-Ashbury 7:30 PM\u20139:45 PM; you need \u226575 minutes with her.\n\nConsidered schedules\n1) Sunset-heavy day, meet Nancy late (single trip)\n   - 9:00 AM\u20138:15 PM: Meet friends in Sunset District (11h 15m of meeting time).\n   - 8:15\u20138:30 PM: Travel to Haight-Ashbury.\n   - 8:30\u20139:45 PM: Meet Nancy (75 minutes exactly).\n   - Optional: 9:45\u201310:00 PM travel back to Sunset if you have late-night plans there.\n   - Pros: Maximizes total friend-meeting time with minimal travel; guarantees Nancy. Cons: Little time in Haight for anyone else besides Nancy.\n\n2) Meet Nancy early, then return to Sunset (two trips)\n   - 9:00 AM\u20137:15 PM: Sunset friends (10h 15m).\n   - 7:15\u20137:30 PM: Travel to Haight.\n   - 7:30\u20138:45 PM: Meet Nancy (75 minutes).\n   - 8:45\u20139:00 PM: Travel back to Sunset.\n   - 9:00 PM\u2013late: Additional Sunset friends (as available).\n   - Pros: Preserves a post-9 PM window back in Sunset. Cons: Reduces daytime Sunset window by an hour vs Schedule 1; more travel.\n\n3) Split the day across both areas, then Nancy (two trips, broader coverage)\n   - 9:00 AM\u20131:00 PM: Sunset friends (4h).\n   - 1:00\u20131:15 PM: Travel to Haight.\n   - 1:15\u20137:30 PM: Haight friends (6h 15m, includes a 15m buffer before Nancy).\n   - 7:30\u20138:45 PM: Meet Nancy (75 minutes).\n   - 8:45\u20139:00 PM: Optional travel back to Sunset.\n   - Pros: Maximizes chance to see friends in both neighborhoods. Cons: More travel; slightly less total contiguous time in your arrival neighborhood than Schedule 1.\n\nBest choice to optimize \u201cmeet as many friends as possible\u201d without other constraints: Schedule 1\n- Rationale: With unknown friend availability and only one guaranteed meetup (Nancy), the dominant move is to maximize total open meeting time while minimizing travel. Schedule 1 gives you 11h 15m straight in Sunset plus 75 minutes with Nancy, with just one pre-Nancy travel leg. It preserves the broadest, least fragmented window to stack as many Sunset meetings as possible and still meet Nancy.\n\nFinal itinerary (selected)\n- 9:00 AM: Arrive Sunset District.\n- 9:00 AM\u20138:15 PM: Meet Sunset friends.\n- 8:15\u20138:30 PM: Travel to Haight-Ashbury.\n- 8:30\u20139:45 PM: Meet Nancy (meets the 75-minute minimum exactly).\n- Optional: 9:45\u201310:00 PM return to Sunset if you have additional late-night availability there.\n\nHelpful timing notes\n- Latest departure from Sunset to still meet Nancy for 75 minutes: 8:15 PM (arrive 8:30 PM, leave at 9:45 PM).\n- Earliest end time that still satisfies Nancy if you start at 7:30 PM: 8:45 PM (you could then be back in Sunset by ~9:00 PM, i.e., Schedule 2 variant)."
