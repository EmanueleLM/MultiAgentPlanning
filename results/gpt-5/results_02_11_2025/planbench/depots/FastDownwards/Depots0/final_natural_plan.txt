Here is the human-readable execution of the provided plan, with timestamps and durations. The action names and arguments match the plan exactly.

- Step 1 (t=0.0 → 1.0, duration 1): sip(object_8, object_1, object_7)
  Effect: Creates vase(object_8, object_1) and removes next(object_8, object_7).

- Step 2 (t=1.0 → 2.0, duration 1): memory(object_1, object_7, object_6)
  Effect: Switches the link from next(object_1, object_7) to next(object_1, object_6).

- Step 3 (t=2.0 → 3.0, duration 1): paltry(object_8, object_1, object_6)
  Effect: Establishes next(object_8, object_6) and removes vase(object_8, object_1).

Outcome: Goal achieved — next(object_8, object_6) is true at t=3.0.
