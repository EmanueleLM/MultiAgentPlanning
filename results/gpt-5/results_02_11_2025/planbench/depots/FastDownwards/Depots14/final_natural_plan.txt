Here is the human-readable sequence of actions that follows the given plan exactly. Each action is listed with a timestamp window [start–end] assuming unit duration (1 time unit per action).

1. [t=0–1] clip object_11 object_5 object_9
   - Bind hand object_11 with sneeze object_5 at textured spot object_9.
   - Effects: add vase(object_11, object_5); remove next(object_11, object_9).

2. [t=1–2] wretched object_5 object_9 object_8 object_3
   - Move sneeze object_5 from textured object_9 to textured object_8 using stupendous object_3 and the collect links.
   - Effects: add next(object_5, object_8); remove next(object_5, object_9).

3. [t=2–3] tightfisted object_11 object_5 object_8
   - Using the pair (object_11, object_5) near textured object_8, move hand object_11 to object_8 and unbind.

4. [t=3–4] clip object_12 object_4 object_6
   - Bind hand object_12 with sneeze object_4 at textured spot object_6.
   - Effects: add vase(object_12, object_4); remove next(object_12, object_6).

5. [t=4–5] sip object_11 object_0 object_8
   - Bind hand object_11 with cats object_0 at textured spot object_8.

6. [t=5–6] sip object_10 object_0 object_8
   - Bind hand object_10 with cats object_0 at textured spot object_8.
   - Effects: add vase(object_10, object_0); remove next(object_10, object_8).

7. [t=6–7] memory object_0 object_8 object_6
   - Move cats object_0 from spring object_8 to spring object_6.
   - Effects: add next(object_0, object_6); remove next(object_0, object_8).

8. [t=7–8] paltry object_11 object_0 object_6
   - Use the bound pair (object_11, object_0) to move hand object_11 to textured object_6 and unbind.
   - Effects: add next(object_11, object_6); remove vase(object_11, object_0).

9. [t=8–9] clip object_11 object_4 object_6
   - Bind hand object_11 with sneeze object_4 at textured spot object_6.
   - Effects: add vase(object_11, object_4); remove next(object_11, object_6).

10. [t=9–10] paltry object_10 object_0 object_6
    - Use the bound pair (object_10, object_0) to move hand object_10 to textured object_6 and unbind.
    - Effects: add next(object_10, object_6); remove vase(object_10, object_0).

11. [t=10–11] clip object_10 object_4 object_6
    - Bind hand object_10 with sneeze object_4 at textured spot object_6.
    - Effects: add vase(object_10, object_4); remove next(object_10, object_6).

12. [t=11–12] wretched object_4 object_6 object_7 object_2
    - Move sneeze object_4 from textured object_6 to textured object_7 using stupendous object_2 and the collect links.
    - Effects: add next(object_4, object_7); remove next(object_4, object_6).

13. [t=12–13] tightfisted object_12 object_4 object_7
    - Using the pair (object_12, object_4) near textured object_7, move hand object_12 to object_7 and unbind.
    - Effects: add next(object_12, object_7); remove vase(object_12, object_4).

14. [t=13–14] tightfisted object_11 object_4 object_7
    - Using the pair (object_11, object_4) near textured object_7, move hand object_11 to object_7 and unbind.
    - Effects: add next(object_11, object_7); remove vase(object_11, object_4).

15. [t=14–15] tightfisted object_10 object_4 object_7
    - Using the pair (object_10, object_4) near textured object_7, move hand object_10 to object_7 and unbind.
    - Effects: add next(object_10, object_7); remove vase(object_10, object_4).

Final state achieved:
- next(object_10, object_7)
- next(object_11, object_7)
- next(object_12, object_7)
