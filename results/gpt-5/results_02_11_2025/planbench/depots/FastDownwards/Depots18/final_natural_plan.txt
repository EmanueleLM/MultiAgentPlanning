- Step 1 (t=0–1): wretched(a=object_3, b=object_7, c=object_6, d=object_1). Redirect next(object_3, object_7) to next(object_3, object_6).
- Step 2 (t=1–2): clip(x=object_11, y=object_3, z=object_6). Create vase(object_11, object_3); remove next(object_11, object_6).
- Step 3 (t=2–3): wretched(a=object_3, b=object_6, c=object_5, d=object_1). Redirect next(object_3, object_6) to next(object_3, object_5).
- Step 4 (t=3–4): tightfisted(x=object_11, y=object_3, z=object_5). Create next(object_11, object_5); remove vase(object_11, object_3).
- Step 5 (t=4–5): memory(x=object_0, y=object_8, z=object_5). Redirect next(object_0, object_8) to next(object_0, object_5).
- Step 6 (t=5–6): sip(x=object_11, y=object_0, z=object_5). Create vase(object_11, object_0); remove next(object_11, object_5).
- Step 7 (t=6–7): memory(x=object_0, y=object_5, z=object_8). Redirect next(object_0, object_5) to next(object_0, object_8).
- Step 8 (t=7–8): paltry(x=object_11, y=object_0, z=object_8). Create next(object_11, object_8); remove vase(object_11, object_0).
- Step 9 (t=8–9): clip(x=object_11, y=object_4, z=object_8). Create vase(object_11, object_4); remove next(object_11, object_8).
- Step 10 (t=9–10): wretched(a=object_4, b=object_8, c=object_10, d=object_2). Redirect next(object_4, object_8) to next(object_4, object_10).
- Step 11 (t=10–11): tightfisted(x=object_11, y=object_4, z=object_10). Create next(object_11, object_10); remove vase(object_11, object_4).

Result: Goal achieved — next(object_11, object_10) holds.
