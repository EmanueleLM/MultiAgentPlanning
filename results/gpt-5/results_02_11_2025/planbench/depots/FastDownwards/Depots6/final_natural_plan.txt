Human-readable action sequence to achieve goal: next(object_10, object_6)

- Step 1 (t=0, dur=1): clip object_10 object_5 object_9
  Description: Using hand(object_10), sneeze(object_5), and texture(object_9) with both at next(..., object_9), create vase(object_10, object_5) and remove next(object_10, object_9).

- Step 2 (t=1, dur=1): wretched object_5 object_9 object_8 object_3
  Description: With sneeze(object_5), textures on object_9 and object_8, stupendous(object_3), and collect(object_9, object_3), collect(object_8, object_3), shift adjacency of object_5 from object_9 to object_8 (add next(object_5, object_8), delete next(object_5, object_9)).

- Step 3 (t=2, dur=1): tightfisted object_10 object_5 object_8
  Description: Using vase(object_10, object_5), sneeze(object_5), texture(object_8), and next(object_5, object_8), set next(object_10, object_8) and remove vase(object_10, object_5).

- Step 4 (t=3, dur=1): sip object_10 object_0 object_8
  Description: With hand(object_10), cats(object_0), texture(object_8), and both next(object_10, object_8) and next(object_0, object_8), create vase(object_10, object_0) and remove next(object_10, object_8).

- Step 5 (t=4, dur=1): memory object_0 object_8 object_6
  Description: Using cats(object_0), spring(object_8), spring(object_6), and next(object_0, object_8), shift adjacency to next(object_0, object_6) and remove next(object_0, object_8).

- Step 6 (t=5, dur=1): paltry object_10 object_0 object_6
  Description: With hand(object_10), cats(object_0), texture(object_6), vase(object_10, object_0), and next(object_0, object_6), set next(object_10, object_6) and remove vase(object_10, object_0).

Result: Goal achieved — next(object_10, object_6).
