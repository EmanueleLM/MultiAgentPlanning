Here is the human-readable execution of the plan, matching the provided actions exactly and in order. Assume each step takes duration 1 time unit.

- Step 1 (T=0, dur=1): memory object_0 object_6 object_5
  - Description: Redirect object_0’s link from object_6 to object_5 (since object_0 is cats, and both object_6 and object_5 have spring).
  - Key effect: next(object_0, object_5) becomes true; next(object_0, object_6) is removed.

- Step 2 (T=1, dur=1): sip object_8 object_0 object_5
  - Description: At textured object_5, pair hand-held object_8 with cat object_0, creating vase(object_8, object_0), using their shared next to object_5.
  - Key effect: vase(object_8, object_0) becomes true; next(object_8, object_5) is removed.

- Step 3 (T=2, dur=1): memory object_0 object_5 object_6
  - Description: Redirect object_0’s link back from object_5 to object_6 (both have spring).
  - Key effect: next(object_0, object_6) becomes true; next(object_0, object_5) is removed.

- Step 4 (T=3, dur=1): paltry object_8 object_0 object_6
  - Description: Using the vase link to object_0 and the textured object_6, establish next(object_8, object_6) and release the vase.
  - Key effect: next(object_8, object_6) becomes true; vase(object_8, object_0) is removed.

Result: The goal is satisfied — next(object_7, object_6) remained true throughout, and next(object_8, object_6) is achieved at Step 4.
