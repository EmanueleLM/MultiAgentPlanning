Here is a clear, human-readable sequence that follows the provided plan exactly. Each step lists the action, its arguments, and the key outcome. All actions are executed sequentially with duration 1 time unit.

1) t=0, duration=1 — clip(object_12, object_5, object_9)
- Result: add vase(object_12, object_5); remove next(object_12, object_9)

2) t=1, duration=1 — clip(object_10, object_5, object_9)
- Result: add vase(object_10, object_5); remove next(object_10, object_9)

3) t=2, duration=1 — sip(object_13, object_1, object_6)
- Result: add vase(object_13, object_1); remove next(object_13, object_6)

4) t=3, duration=1 — wretched(object_4, object_7, object_6, object_2)
- Result: add next(object_4, object_6); remove next(object_4, object_7)

5) t=4, duration=1 — wretched(object_5, object_9, object_8, object_3)
- Result: add next(object_5, object_8); remove next(object_5, object_9)

6) t=5, duration=1 — tightfisted(object_12, object_5, object_8)
- Result: add next(object_12, object_8); remove vase(object_12, object_5)

7) t=6, duration=1 — clip(object_11, object_5, object_8)
- Result: add vase(object_11, object_5); remove next(object_11, object_8)

8) t=7, duration=1 — tightfisted(object_10, object_5, object_8)
- Result: add next(object_10, object_8); remove vase(object_10, object_5)

9) t=8, duration=1 — memory(object_1, object_6, object_8)
- Result: add next(object_1, object_8); remove next(object_1, object_6)

10) t=9, duration=1 — paltry(object_13, object_1, object_8)
- Result: add next(object_13, object_8); remove vase(object_13, object_1)

11) t=10, duration=1 — clip(object_13, object_5, object_8)
- Result: add vase(object_13, object_5); remove next(object_13, object_8)

12) t=11, duration=1 — wretched(object_5, object_8, object_9, object_3)
- Result: add next(object_5, object_9); remove next(object_5, object_8)

13) t=12, duration=1 — tightfisted(object_13, object_5, object_9)
- Result: add next(object_13, object_9); remove vase(object_13, object_5)

14) t=13, duration=1 — tightfisted(object_11, object_5, object_9)
- Result: add next(object_11, object_9); remove vase(object_11, object_5)

15) t=14, duration=1 — sip(object_12, object_1, object_8)
- Result: add vase(object_12, object_1); remove next(object_12, object_8)

16) t=15, duration=1 — sip(object_10, object_1, object_8)
- Result: add vase(object_10, object_1); remove next(object_10, object_8)

17) t=16, duration=1 — memory(object_1, object_8, object_6)
- Result: add next(object_1, object_6); remove next(object_1, object_8)

18) t=17, duration=1 — paltry(object_12, object_1, object_6)
- Result: add next(object_12, object_6); remove vase(object_12, object_1)

19) t=18, duration=1 — clip(object_12, object_4, object_6)
- Result: add vase(object_12, object_4); remove next(object_12, object_6)

20) t=19, duration=1 — wretched(object_4, object_6, object_7, object_2)
- Result: add next(object_4, object_7); remove next(object_4, object_6)

21) t=20, duration=1 — tightfisted(object_12, object_4, object_7)
- Result: add next(object_12, object_7); remove vase(object_12, object_4)

22) t=21, duration=1 — paltry(object_10, object_1, object_6)
- Result: add next(object_10, object_6); remove vase(object_10, object_1)

Final goal achieved after step 22:
- next(object_10, object_6)
- next(object_11, object_9)
- next(object_12, object_7)
- next(object_13, object_9)
