Here is the human-readable sequence of actions, following the provided plan exactly.

- Step 1 (t=00:00, duration ≈1): Perform wretched(object_4, object_10, object_8, object_2).
  Rationale: Redirect object_4’s link from object_10 to object_8 given the required textures, stupendous tag, and collections.
  Effect: next(object_4, object_8) holds; next(object_4, object_10) is removed.

- Step 2 (t=00:01, duration ≈1): Perform clip(object_11, object_4, object_8).
  Rationale: With hand on object_11, sneeze at object_4, and texture at object_8, and both having next to object_8, link object_11 to object_4 via a vase.
  Effect: vase(object_11, object_4) holds; next(object_11, object_8) is removed.

- Step 3 (t=00:02, duration ≈1): Perform wretched(object_4, object_8, object_9, object_2).
  Rationale: Shift object_4’s link from object_8 to object_9 using the required textures, stupendous tag, and collections.
  Effect: next(object_4, object_9) holds; next(object_4, object_8) is removed.

- Step 4 (t=00:03, duration ≈1): Perform tightfisted(object_11, object_4, object_9).
  Rationale: With vase(object_11, object_4), sneeze at object_4, and texture at object_9, advance object_11’s link to object_9.
  Effect: next(object_11, object_9) holds; vase(object_11, object_4) is removed.

Goal achieved: next(object_11, object_9). Total steps: 4.
