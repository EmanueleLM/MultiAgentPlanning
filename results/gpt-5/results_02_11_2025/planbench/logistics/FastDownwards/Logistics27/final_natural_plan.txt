Here is a clear, human-readable rendering of the provided plan. Each step lists start time and duration (assumed 1 time unit), follows the given action exactly, and highlights the key effect.

- Step 1 [T=0..1]: wretched object_5 object_10 object_11 object_3 — Redirect next for object_5 from object_10 to object_11.
- Step 2 [T=1..2]: clip object_12 object_5 object_11 — Create vase(object_12, object_5) by releasing object_12 from next(..., object_11).
- Step 3 [T=2..3]: wretched object_5 object_11 object_10 object_3 — Redirect next for object_5 from object_11 back to object_10.
- Step 4 [T=3..4]: tightfisted object_12 object_5 object_10 — Use vase link to set next(object_12, object_10); remove vase(object_12, object_5).
- Step 5 [T=4..5]: wretched object_5 object_10 object_9 object_3 — Redirect next for object_5 from object_10 to object_9.
- Step 6 [T=5..6]: wretched object_4 object_7 object_8 object_2 — Redirect next for object_4 from object_7 to object_8.
- Step 7 [T=6..7]: clip object_14 object_4 object_8 — Create vase(object_14, object_4) by releasing object_14 from next(..., object_8).
- Step 8 [T=7..8]: wretched object_4 object_8 object_6 object_2 — Redirect next for object_4 from object_8 to object_6.
- Step 9 [T=8..9]: tightfisted object_14 object_4 object_6 — Use vase link to set next(object_14, object_6); remove vase(object_14, object_4).
- Step 10 [T=9..10]: sip object_14 object_0 object_6 — Create vase(object_14, object_0) by releasing object_14 from next(..., object_6).
- Step 11 [T=10..11]: sip object_13 object_0 object_6 — Create vase(object_13, object_0) by releasing object_13 from next(..., object_6).
- Step 12 [T=11..12]: memory object_0 object_6 object_9 — Move next for cat object_0 from object_6 to object_9.
- Step 13 [T=12..13]: paltry object_14 object_0 object_9 — Use vase(object_14, object_0) and next(object_0, object_9) to set next(object_14, object_9); remove vase.
- Step 14 [T=13..14]: paltry object_13 object_0 object_9 — Use vase(object_13, object_0) and next(object_0, object_9) to set next(object_13, object_9); remove vase.
- Step 15 [T=14..15]: clip object_13 object_5 object_9 — Create vase(object_13, object_5) by releasing object_13 from next(..., object_9).
- Step 16 [T=15..16]: wretched object_5 object_9 object_10 object_3 — Redirect next for object_5 from object_9 to object_10.
- Step 17 [T=16..17]: tightfisted object_13 object_5 object_10 — Use vase link to set next(object_13, object_10); remove vase(object_13, object_5).

Final goal achieved:
- next(object_12, object_10)
- next(object_13, object_10)
- next(object_14, object_9)
