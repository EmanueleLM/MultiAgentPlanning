Here is the human-readable execution of the plan, step by step. Each action takes 1 time unit (Δt = 1). Timestamps indicate start→end.

1) t=0→1 — clip object_10 object_5 object_9
- Preconditions used: hand(object_10), sneeze(object_5), texture(object_9), next(object_5, object_9), next(object_10, object_9)
- State changes:
  - Add: vase(object_10, object_5)
  - Del: next(object_10, object_9)

2) t=1→2 — wretched object_5 object_9 object_8 object_3
- Preconditions used: sneeze(object_5), texture(object_9), texture(object_8), stupendous(object_3), next(object_5, object_9), collect(object_9, object_3), collect(object_8, object_3)
- State changes:
  - Add: next(object_5, object_8)
  - Del: next(object_5, object_9)

3) t=2→3 — tightfisted object_10 object_5 object_8
- Preconditions used: hand(object_10), sneeze(object_5), texture(object_8), next(object_5, object_8), vase(object_10, object_5)
- State changes:
  - Add: next(object_10, object_8)
  - Del: vase(object_10, object_5)

4) t=3→4 — sip object_10 object_0 object_8
- Preconditions used: hand(object_10), cats(object_0), texture(object_8), next(object_10, object_8), next(object_0, object_8)
- State changes:
  - Add: vase(object_10, object_0)
  - Del: next(object_10, object_8)

5) t=4→5 — memory object_0 object_8 object_6
- Preconditions used: cats(object_0), spring(object_8), spring(object_6), next(object_0, object_8)
- State changes:
  - Add: next(object_0, object_6)
  - Del: next(object_0, object_8)

6) t=5→6 — paltry object_10 object_0 object_6
- Preconditions used: hand(object_10), cats(object_0), texture(object_6), vase(object_10, object_0), next(object_0, object_6)
- State changes:
  - Add: next(object_10, object_6)
  - Del: vase(object_10, object_0)

Result: Goal achieved — next(object_10, object_6) holds at t=6.
Total time/cost: 6 units.
