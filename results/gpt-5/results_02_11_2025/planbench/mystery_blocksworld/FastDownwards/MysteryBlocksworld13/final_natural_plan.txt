Here is the human-readable execution of the plan, following the given action order exactly. Each step assumes duration Δt = 1 time unit and advances the timestamp by 1.

1) t=0 → 1 | wretched object_5 object_8 object_9 object_3
   - Effect: add next(object_5, object_9); delete next(object_5, object_8).

2) t=1 → 2 | clip object_10 object_5 object_9
   - Effect: add vase(object_10, object_5); delete next(object_10, object_9).

3) t=2 → 3 | wretched object_4 object_7 object_6 object_2
   - Effect: add next(object_4, object_6); delete next(object_4, object_7).

4) t=3 → 4 | sip object_12 object_0 object_6
   - Effect: add vase(object_12, object_0); delete next(object_12, object_6).

5) t=4 → 5 | sip object_11 object_0 object_6
   - Effect: add vase(object_11, object_0); delete next(object_11, object_6).

6) t=5 → 6 | wretched object_5 object_9 object_8 object_3
   - Effect: add next(object_5, object_8); delete next(object_5, object_9).

7) t=6 → 7 | tightfisted object_10 object_5 object_8
   - Effect: add next(object_10, object_8); delete vase(object_10, object_5).

8) t=7 → 8 | sip object_10 object_1 object_8
   - Effect: add vase(object_10, object_1); delete next(object_10, object_8).

9) t=8 → 9 | memory object_1 object_8 object_6
   - Effect: add next(object_1, object_6); delete next(object_1, object_8).

10) t=9 → 10 | paltry object_10 object_1 object_6
    - Effect: add next(object_10, object_6); delete vase(object_10, object_1).

11) t=10 → 11 | clip object_10 object_4 object_6
    - Effect: add vase(object_10, object_4); delete next(object_10, object_6).

12) t=11 → 12 | wretched object_4 object_6 object_7 object_2
    - Effect: add next(object_4, object_7); delete next(object_4, object_6).

13) t=12 → 13 | tightfisted object_10 object_4 object_7
    - Effect: add next(object_10, object_7); delete vase(object_10, object_4).

14) t=13 → 14 | memory object_0 object_6 object_8
    - Effect: add next(object_0, object_8); delete next(object_0, object_6).

15) t=14 → 15 | paltry object_12 object_0 object_8
    - Effect: add next(object_12, object_8); delete vase(object_12, object_0).

16) t=15 → 16 | paltry object_11 object_0 object_8
    - Effect: add next(object_11, object_8); delete vase(object_11, object_0).

17) t=16 → 17 | clip object_11 object_5 object_8
    - Effect: add vase(object_11, object_5); delete next(object_11, object_8).

18) t=17 → 18 | wretched object_5 object_8 object_9 object_3
    - Effect: add next(object_5, object_9); delete next(object_5, object_8).

19) t=18 → 19 | tightfisted object_11 object_5 object_9
    - Effect: add next(object_11, object_9); delete vase(object_11, object_5).

Final check (goal satisfied):
- next(object_10, object_7) achieved at step 13.
- next(object_11, object_9) achieved at step 19.
- next(object_12, object_8) achieved at step 15.
