Here is the human-readable sequence that mirrors the given plan exactly. Each action is shown with a timestamp (t) and unit duration (Δt=1). Short notes indicate what changes (adds/deletes) in terms of next(...) and vase(...).

- t=00, Δt=1: clip object_11 object_5 object_9
  Description: Using hand object_11 with sneeze object_5 while both are next to texture object_9.
  Effect: add vase(object_11, object_5); delete next(object_11, object_9).

- t=01, Δt=1: wretched object_5 object_9 object_8 object_3
  Description: Move sneeze object_5 from texture object_9 to texture object_8 under stupendous object_3 (shared collects).
  Effect: add next(object_5, object_8); delete next(object_5, object_9).

- t=02, Δt=1: tightfisted object_11 object_5 object_8
  Description: With vase(object_11, object_5) and sneeze object_5 next to texture object_8, place hand object_11 next to object_8 and drop the vase.
  Effect: add next(object_11, object_8); delete vase(object_11, object_5).

- t=03, Δt=1: clip object_10 object_4 object_7
  Description: Using hand object_10 with sneeze object_4 while both are next to texture object_7.
  Effect: add vase(object_10, object_4); delete next(object_10, object_7).

- t=04, Δt=1: sip object_12 object_1 object_8
  Description: Using hand object_12 with cats object_1 while both are next to texture object_8.
  Effect: add vase(object_12, object_1); delete next(object_12, object_8).

- t=05, Δt=1: memory object_1 object_8 object_6
  Description: Move cats object_1 from spring object_8 to spring object_6.
  Effect: add next(object_1, object_6); delete next(object_1, object_8).

- t=06, Δt=1: wretched object_4 object_7 object_6 object_2
  Description: Move sneeze object_4 from texture object_7 to texture object_6 under stupendous object_2 (shared collects).
  Effect: add next(object_4, object_6); delete next(object_4, object_7).

- t=07, Δt=1: tightfisted object_10 object_4 object_6
  Description: With vase(object_10, object_4) and sneeze object_4 next to texture object_6, place hand object_10 next to object_6 and drop the vase.
  Effect: add next(object_10, object_6); delete vase(object_10, object_4).

- t=08, Δt=1: paltry object_12 object_1 object_6
  Description: With vase(object_12, object_1) and cats object_1 next to texture object_6, place hand object_12 next to object_6 and drop the vase.
  Effect: add next(object_12, object_6); delete vase(object_12, object_1).

- t=09, Δt=1: clip object_12 object_4 object_6
  Description: Using hand object_12 with sneeze object_4 while both are next to texture object_6.
  Effect: add vase(object_12, object_4); delete next(object_12, object_6).

- t=10, Δt=1: wretched object_4 object_6 object_7 object_2
  Description: Move sneeze object_4 from texture object_6 to texture object_7 under stupendous object_2 (shared collects).
  Effect: add next(object_4, object_7); delete next(object_4, object_6).

- t=11, Δt=1: tightfisted object_12 object_4 object_7
  Description: With vase(object_12, object_4) and sneeze object_4 next to texture object_7, place hand object_12 next to object_7 and drop the vase.
  Effect: add next(object_12, object_7); delete vase(object_12, object_4).
