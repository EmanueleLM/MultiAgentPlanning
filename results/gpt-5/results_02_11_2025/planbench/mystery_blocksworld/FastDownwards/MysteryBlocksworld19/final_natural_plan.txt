Here is a human-readable rendition of the plan, preserving the exact action order and arguments. Each action takes duration 1 time unit; timestamps show cumulative time.

- Step 1 [t=0 → 1] duration 1: wretched(object_3, object_7, object_6, object_1)
  - Effect: add next(object_3, object_6); delete next(object_3, object_7).

- Step 2 [t=1 → 2] duration 1: clip(object_11, object_3, object_6)
  - Effect: add vase(object_11, object_3); delete next(object_11, object_6).

- Step 3 [t=2 → 3] duration 1: wretched(object_3, object_6, object_5, object_1)
  - Effect: add next(object_3, object_5); delete next(object_3, object_6).

- Step 4 [t=3 → 4] duration 1: tightfisted(object_11, object_3, object_5)
  - Effect: add next(object_11, object_5); delete vase(object_11, object_3).

- Step 5 [t=4 → 5] duration 1: memory(object_0, object_8, object_5)
  - Effect: add next(object_0, object_5); delete next(object_0, object_8).

- Step 6 [t=5 → 6] duration 1: sip(object_11, object_0, object_5)
  - Effect: add vase(object_11, object_0); delete next(object_11, object_5).

- Step 7 [t=6 → 7] duration 1: memory(object_0, object_5, object_8)
  - Effect: add next(object_0, object_8); delete next(object_0, object_5).

- Step 8 [t=7 → 8] duration 1: paltry(object_11, object_0, object_8)
  - Effect: add next(object_11, object_8); delete vase(object_11, object_0).

- Step 9 [t=8 → 9] duration 1: clip(object_11, object_4, object_8)
  - Effect: add vase(object_11, object_4); delete next(object_11, object_8).

- Step 10 [t=9 → 10] duration 1: wretched(object_4, object_8, object_10, object_2)
  - Effect: add next(object_4, object_10); delete next(object_4, object_8).

- Step 11 [t=10 → 11] duration 1: tightfisted(object_11, object_4, object_10)
  - Effect: add next(object_11, object_10); delete vase(object_11, object_4).

Goal achieved: next(object_11, object_10). Total time: 11 time units.
