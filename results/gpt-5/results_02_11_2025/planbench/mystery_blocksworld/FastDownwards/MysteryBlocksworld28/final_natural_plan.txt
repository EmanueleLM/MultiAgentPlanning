Assumptions: start at t=0s; each action takes 1s (unit duration).

- Step 1 (t=0s–1s): wretched object_4 object_9 object_10 object_2 — Redirect object_4’s link from object_9 to object_10.
- Step 2 (t=1s–2s): clip object_11 object_4 object_10 — Pair object_11 with object_4 (vase), releasing object_11 from next-to object_10.
- Step 3 (t=2s–3s): wretched object_4 object_10 object_8 object_2 — Redirect object_4’s link from object_10 to object_8.
- Step 4 (t=3s–4s): wretched object_3 object_6 object_5 object_1 — Redirect object_3’s link from object_6 to object_5.
- Step 5 (t=4s–5s): wretched object_4 object_8 object_9 object_2 — Redirect object_4’s link from object_8 to object_9.
- Step 6 (t=5s–6s): clip object_14 object_4 object_9 — Pair object_14 with object_4 (vase), releasing object_14 from next-to object_9.
- Step 7 (t=6s–7s): tightfisted object_11 object_4 object_9 — Advance object_11 to next-to object_9 by breaking its vase link to object_4.
- Step 8 (t=7s–8s): wretched object_4 object_9 object_8 object_2 — Redirect object_4’s link from object_9 to object_8.
- Step 9 (t=8s–9s): tightfisted object_14 object_4 object_8 — Advance object_14 to next-to object_8 by breaking its vase link to object_4.
- Step 10 (t=9s–10s): wretched object_3 object_5 object_7 object_1 — Redirect object_3’s link from object_5 to object_7.
- Step 11 (t=10s–11s): clip object_13 object_3 object_7 — Pair object_13 with object_3 (vase), releasing object_13 from next-to object_7.
- Step 12 (t=11s–12s): sip object_14 object_0 object_8 — Pair object_14 with object_0 (vase), releasing object_14 from next-to object_8.
- Step 13 (t=12s–13s): wretched object_3 object_7 object_5 object_1 — Redirect object_3’s link from object_7 to object_5.
- Step 14 (t=13s–14s): tightfisted object_13 object_3 object_5 — Advance object_13 to next-to object_5 by breaking its vase link to object_3.
- Step 15 (t=14s–15s): memory object_0 object_8 object_5 — Switch object_0’s link from object_8 to object_5.
- Step 16 (t=15s–16s): paltry object_14 object_0 object_5 — Advance object_14 to next-to object_5 by breaking its vase link to object_0.
- Step 17 (t=16s–17s): clip object_14 object_3 object_5 — Pair object_14 with object_3 (vase), releasing object_14 from next-to object_5.
- Step 18 (t=17s–18s): wretched object_3 object_5 object_7 object_1 — Redirect object_3’s link from object_5 to object_7.
- Step 19 (t=18s–19s): tightfisted object_14 object_3 object_7 — Advance object_14 to next-to object_7 by breaking its vase link to object_3.
- Step 20 (t=19s–20s): sip object_12 object_0 object_5 — Pair object_12 with object_0 (vase), releasing object_12 from next-to object_5.
- Step 21 (t=20s–21s): memory object_0 object_5 object_8 — Switch object_0’s link from object_5 to object_8.
- Step 22 (t=21s–22s): paltry object_12 object_0 object_8 — Advance object_12 to next-to object_8 by breaking its vase link to object_0.

Final goal achieved:
- next object_11 object_9
- next object_12 object_8
- next object_13 object_5
- next object_14 object_7
