Here is the human-readable action sequence that exactly follows the given plan and achieves the goal:

- t=0 → t=1 (duration: 1)
  Action: memory(object_1, object_6, object_7)
  Effect: switches link from next(object_1, object_6) to next(object_1, object_7).

- t=1 → t=2 (duration: 1)
  Action: sip(object_9, object_1, object_7)
  Effect: creates vase(object_9, object_1) and removes next(object_9, object_7).

- t=2 → t=3 (duration: 1)
  Action: memory(object_1, object_7, object_6)
  Effect: switches link from next(object_1, object_7) back to next(object_1, object_6).

- t=3 → t=4 (duration: 1)
  Action: paltry(object_9, object_1, object_6)
  Effect: creates next(object_9, object_6) and removes vase(object_9, object_1).

Result: Goal satisfied — next(object_8, object_7) remains true, and next(object_9, object_6) is achieved.
