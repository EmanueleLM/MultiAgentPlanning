Here is the human-readable sequence of actions, matching the provided plan exactly. Each action is listed with a simple timestamp and its key effect.

1) T+0 to T+1 — memory object_1 object_6 object_7
- Redirect object_1’s next from object_6 to object_7.
- Effect: add next(object_1, object_7); delete next(object_1, object_6).

2) T+1 to T+2 — sip object_9 object_1 object_7
- Using object_9’s hand and both at object_7, bind object_9 to object_1 via a vase and release object_9 from next to object_7.
- Effect: add vase(object_9, object_1); delete next(object_9, object_7).

3) T+2 to T+3 — memory object_1 object_7 object_6
- Redirect object_1’s next back from object_7 to object_6.
- Effect: add next(object_1, object_6); delete next(object_1, object_7).

4) T+3 to T+4 — paltry object_9 object_1 object_6
- Using the vase link with object_1 and next(object_1, object_6), move object_9’s next to object_6 and clear the vase link.
- Effect: add next(object_9, object_6); delete vase(object_9, object_1).

Final goal satisfied:
- next(object_8, object_7) remains true from the start.
- next(object_9, object_6) established in step 4.
