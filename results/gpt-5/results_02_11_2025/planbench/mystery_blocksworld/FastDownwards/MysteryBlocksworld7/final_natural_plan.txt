Here is the human-readable sequence that follows the given plan exactly (assuming unit-duration actions; each step lasts 1 time unit).

- Step 1 [t=0–1]: clip(object_10, object_5, object_9)
  - Effect: establish vase(object_10, object_5); remove next(object_10, object_9).

- Step 2 [t=1–2]: wretched(object_5, object_9, object_8, object_3)
  - Effect: switch adjacency of object_5 from object_9 to object_8 (add next(object_5, object_8); remove next(object_5, object_9)).

- Step 3 [t=2–3]: tightfisted(object_10, object_5, object_8)
  - Effect: add next(object_10, object_8); remove vase(object_10, object_5).

- Step 4 [t=3–4]: sip(object_10, object_0, object_8)
  - Effect: establish vase(object_10, object_0); remove next(object_10, object_8).

- Step 5 [t=4–5]: memory(object_0, object_8, object_6)
  - Effect: switch adjacency of object_0 from object_8 to object_6 (add next(object_0, object_6); remove next(object_0, object_8)).

- Step 6 [t=5–6]: paltry(object_10, object_0, object_6)
  - Effect: add next(object_10, object_6); remove vase(object_10, object_0).

Result: Goal achieved — next(object_10, object_6).
