Here is the human-readable execution of the plan, following the given actions exactly and in order. All actions are instantaneous; timestamps are provided for sequencing.

1) t=0 — wretched(object_5, object_8, object_9, object_3) [instantaneous]
- Redirect next for object_5 from object_8 to object_9 (add next(object_5, object_9); delete next(object_5, object_8)).

2) t=1 — clip(object_11, object_5, object_9) [instantaneous]
- Using the shared texture object_9, bind object_11 to object_5 (add vase(object_11, object_5)) and consume object_11’s link to object_9 (delete next(object_11, object_9)).

3) t=2 — wretched(object_5, object_9, object_8, object_3) [instantaneous]
- Redirect next for object_5 from object_9 back to object_8 (add next(object_5, object_8); delete next(object_5, object_9)).

4) t=3 — tightfisted(object_11, object_5, object_8) [instantaneous]
- Using the binding vase(object_11, object_5) at texture object_8, move object_11 to object_8 (add next(object_11, object_8)) and release the binding (delete vase(object_11, object_5)).

5) t=4 — clip(object_10, object_4, object_6) [instantaneous]
- Using the shared texture object_6, bind object_10 to object_4 (add vase(object_10, object_4)) and consume object_10’s link to object_6 (delete next(object_10, object_6)).

6) t=5 — wretched(object_4, object_6, object_7, object_2) [instantaneous]
- Redirect next for object_4 from object_6 to object_7 (add next(object_4, object_7); delete next(object_4, object_6)).

7) t=6 — tightfisted(object_10, object_4, object_7) [instantaneous]
- Using the binding vase(object_10, object_4) at texture object_7, move object_10 to object_7 (add next(object_10, object_7)) and release the binding (delete vase(object_10, object_4)).

Result: Goals achieved — next(object_10, object_7) and next(object_11, object_8).
