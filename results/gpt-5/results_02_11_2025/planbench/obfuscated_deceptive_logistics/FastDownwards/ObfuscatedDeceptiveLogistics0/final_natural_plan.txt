1) [t=0–1, duration 1] (sip object_8 object_1 object_7)
   - Use object_8 (hand) and object_1 (cats) at texture object_7 to create vase(object_8, object_1) and remove next(object_8, object_7).

2) [t=1–2, duration 1] (memory object_1 object_7 object_6)
   - Redirect object_1’s linkage from object_7 to object_6: add next(object_1, object_6) and delete next(object_1, object_7).

3) [t=2–3, duration 1] (paltry object_8 object_1 object_6)
   - Using the vase link and next(object_1, object_6) at texture object_6, set next(object_8, object_6) and remove vase(object_8, object_1).

Result: Goal achieved — next(object_8, object_6).
