Here is a clear, step-by-step translation of the provided PDDL plan into human-readable actions. Each step preserves the exact action and arguments from the plan, with a timestamp and duration, plus a concise summary of its key effects.

1) t=0–1 (duration 1): wretched object_5 object_8 object_9 object_3
   - adds (next object_5 object_9); deletes (next object_5 object_8)

2) t=1–2 (duration 1): clip object_10 object_5 object_9
   - adds (vase object_10 object_5); deletes (next object_10 object_9)

3) t=2–3 (duration 1): wretched object_4 object_7 object_6 object_2
   - adds (next object_4 object_6); deletes (next object_4 object_7)

4) t=3–4 (duration 1): sip object_12 object_0 object_6
   - adds (vase object_12 object_0); deletes (next object_12 object_6)

5) t=4–5 (duration 1): sip object_11 object_0 object_6
   - adds (vase object_11 object_0); deletes (next object_11 object_6)

6) t=5–6 (duration 1): wretched object_5 object_9 object_8 object_3
   - adds (next object_5 object_8); deletes (next object_5 object_9)

7) t=6–7 (duration 1): tightfisted object_10 object_5 object_8
   - adds (next object_10 object_8); deletes (vase object_10 object_5)

8) t=7–8 (duration 1): sip object_10 object_1 object_8
   - adds (vase object_10 object_1); deletes (next object_10 object_8)

9) t=8–9 (duration 1): memory object_1 object_8 object_6
   - adds (next object_1 object_6); deletes (next object_1 object_8)

10) t=9–10 (duration 1): paltry object_10 object_1 object_6
    - adds (next object_10 object_6); deletes (vase object_10 object_1)

11) t=10–11 (duration 1): clip object_10 object_4 object_6
    - adds (vase object_10 object_4); deletes (next object_10 object_6)

12) t=11–12 (duration 1): wretched object_4 object_6 object_7 object_2
    - adds (next object_4 object_7); deletes (next object_4 object_6)

13) t=12–13 (duration 1): tightfisted object_10 object_4 object_7
    - adds (next object_10 object_7); deletes (vase object_10 object_4)

14) t=13–14 (duration 1): memory object_0 object_6 object_8
    - adds (next object_0 object_8); deletes (next object_0 object_6)

15) t=14–15 (duration 1): paltry object_12 object_0 object_8
    - adds (next object_12 object_8); deletes (vase object_12 object_0)

16) t=15–16 (duration 1): paltry object_11 object_0 object_8
    - adds (next object_11 object_8); deletes (vase object_11 object_0)

17) t=16–17 (duration 1): clip object_11 object_5 object_8
    - adds (vase object_11 object_5); deletes (next object_11 object_8)

18) t=17–18 (duration 1): wretched object_5 object_8 object_9 object_3
    - adds (next object_5 object_9); deletes (next object_5 object_8)

19) t=18–19 (duration 1): tightfisted object_11 object_5 object_9
    - adds (next object_11 object_9); deletes (vase object_11 object_5)

Result: Final goals achieved — (next object_10 object_7), (next object_11 object_9), and (next object_12 object_8). Total steps: 19; total time: 19 units (assuming unit duration per action).
