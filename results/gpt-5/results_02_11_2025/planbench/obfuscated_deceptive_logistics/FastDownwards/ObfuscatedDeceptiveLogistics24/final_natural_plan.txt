Here is the human-readable execution of the plan, following the given sequence exactly. Assume each action takes 1 time unit.

1. t=0–1: clip(object_12, object_5, object_11)
   - Use hand object_12 and sneeze object_5 at texture object_11 to create vase(object_12, object_5), removing next(object_12, object_11).

2. t=1–2: wretched(object_5, object_11, object_10, object_3)
   - Shift sneeze object_5’s adjacency from texture object_11 to texture object_10 (via stupendous object_3 and collect links).

3. t=2–3: tightfisted(object_12, object_5, object_10)
   - Using the vase link with object_5 at texture object_10, move hand object_12 next to object_10 and remove the vase link.

4. t=3–4: wretched(object_4, object_8, object_6, object_2)
   - Shift sneeze object_4’s adjacency from texture object_8 to texture object_6 (via stupendous object_2 and collect links).

5. t=4–5: wretched(object_4, object_6, object_7, object_2)
   - Shift sneeze object_4’s adjacency from texture object_6 to texture object_7 (via stupendous object_2 and collect links).

6. t=5–6: clip(object_13, object_4, object_7)
   - Use hand object_13 and sneeze object_4 at texture object_7 to create vase(object_13, object_4), removing next(object_13, object_7).

7. t=6–7: wretched(object_4, object_7, object_6, object_2)
   - Shift sneeze object_4’s adjacency from texture object_7 back to texture object_6 (via stupendous object_2 and collect links).

8. t=7–8: tightfisted(object_13, object_4, object_6)
   - Using the vase link with object_4 at texture object_6, move hand object_13 next to object_6 and remove the vase link.

9. t=8–9: memory(object_0, object_9, object_6)
   - Move cats object_0’s adjacency from spring object_9 to spring object_6.

10. t=9–10: sip(object_13, object_0, object_6)
    - With both object_13 and object_0 next to texture object_6, create vase(object_13, object_0) and remove next(object_13, object_6).

11. t=10–11: memory(object_0, object_6, object_9)
    - Move cats object_0’s adjacency from spring object_6 back to spring object_9.

12. t=11–12: paltry(object_13, object_0, object_9)
    - Using the vase link between object_13 and object_0 while object_0 is next to texture object_9, move hand object_13 next to object_9 and remove the vase link.

Final state achieved:
- next(object_12, object_10)
- next(object_13, object_9)
