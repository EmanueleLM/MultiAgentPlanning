Here is the human-readable execution of the given plan, one action per step, with timestamps (unit duration = 1):

1) t=0–1: wretched(object_4, object_10, object_8, object_2) — Move sneezer object_4 from being next to object_10 to being next to object_8.

5) t=4–5: sip(object_12, object_0, object_8) — Hand object_12 links with cat object_0 at texture object_8 (creates vase(object_12, object_0)); object_12 is no longer next to object_8.

6) t=5–6: memory(object_0, object_8, object_5) — Move cat object_0 from being next to object_8 to being next to object_5.

7) t=6–7: paltry(object_12, object_0, object_5) — Using vase(object_12, object_0), place hand object_12 next to texture object_5 and release the vase link.

8) t=7–8: wretched(object_3, object_6, object_5, object_1) — Move sneezer object_3 from being next to object_6 to being next to object_5.

9) t=8–9: clip(object_14, object_3, object_5) — Hand object_14 links with sneezer object_3 at texture object_5 (creates vase(object_14, object_3)); object_14 is no longer next to object_5.

10) t=9–10: tightfisted(object_13, object_3, object_5) — Using vase(object_13, object_3), place hand object_13 next to texture object_5 and release the vase link.

11) t=10–11: clip(object_12, object_3, object_5) — Hand object_12 links with sneezer object_3 at texture object_5 (creates vase(object_12, object_3)); object_12 is no longer next to object_5.

12) t=11–12: tightfisted(object_11, object_3, object_5) — Using vase(object_11, object_3), place hand object_11 next to texture object_5 and release the vase link.

13) t=12–13: wretched(object_3, object_5, object_6, object_1) — Move sneezer object_3 from being next to object_5 to being next to object_6.

14) t=13–14: tightfisted(object_12, object_3, object_6) — Using vase(object_12, object_3), place hand object_12 next to texture object_6 and release the vase link.

15) t=14–15: wretched(object_3, object_6, object_7, object_1) — Move sneezer object_3 from being next to object_6 to being next to object_7.

16) t=15–16: tightfisted(object_14, object_3, object_7) — Using vase(object_14, object_3), place hand object_14 next to texture object_7 and release the vase link.

17) t=16–17: sip(object_13, object_0, object_5) — Hand object_13 links with cat object_0 at texture object_5 (creates vase(object_13, object_0)); object_13 is no longer next to object_5.

18) t=17–18: sip(object_11, object_0, object_5) — Hand object_11 links with cat object_0 at texture object_5 (creates vase(object_11, object_0)); object_11 is no longer next to object_5.

19) t=18–19: memory(object_0, object_5, object_8) — Move cat object_0 from being next to object_5 back to being next to object_8.

20) t=19–20: paltry(object_13, object_0, object_8) — Using vase(object_13, object_0), place hand object_13 next to texture object_8 and release the vase link.

21) t=20–21: clip(object_13, object_4, object_8) — Hand object_13 links with sneezer object_4 at texture object_8 (creates vase(object_13, object_4)); object_13 is no longer next to object_8.

22) t=21–22: paltry(object_11, object_0, object_8) — Using vase(object_11, object_0), place hand object_11 next to texture object_8 and release the vase link.

23) t=22–23: clip(object_11, object_4, object_8) — Hand object_11 links with sneezer object_4 at texture object_8 (creates vase(object_11, object_4)); object_11 is no longer next to object_8.

24) t=23–24: wretched(object_4, object_8, object_10, object_2) — Move sneezer object_4 from being next to object_8 to being next to object_10.

25) t=24–25: tightfisted(object_13, object_4, object_10) — Using vase(object_13, object_4), place hand object_13 next to texture object_10 and release the vase link.

26) t=25–26: tightfisted(object_11, object_4, object_10) — Using vase(object_11, object_4), place hand object_11 next to texture object_10 and release the vase link.

Goal check after step 26:
- next(object_11, object_10) achieved.
- next(object_12, object_6) achieved.
- next(object_13, object_10) achieved.
- next(object_14, object_7) achieved.
