- t=0s (dur=1): memory object_1 object_6 object_7
  Move the cat entity object_1 from being next to object_6 over to object_7 (both are spring-enabled).
  Effects: add next(object_1, object_7); delete next(object_1, object_6).

- t=1s (dur=1): sip object_9 object_1 object_7
  With hand object_9 and cat object_1 both at textured object_7, bind them.
  Effects: add vase(object_9, object_1); delete next(object_9, object_7).

- t=2s (dur=1): memory object_1 object_7 object_6
  Move the cat entity object_1 back from object_7 to object_6.
  Effects: add next(object_1, object_6); delete next(object_1, object_7).

- t=3s (dur=1): paltry object_9 object_1 object_6
  Using the vase link at textured object_6 with cat object_1 present, place object_9 next to object_6 and release the binding.
  Effects: add next(object_9, object_6); delete vase(object_9, object_1).

Result: Goal satisfied — next(object_8, object_7) remains true; next(object_9, object_6) is achieved.
