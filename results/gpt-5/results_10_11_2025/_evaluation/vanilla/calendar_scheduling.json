You are given a few constraints on the existing schedule of each participant, the meeting duration, and possibly some preferences on the meeting time. Note there exists a solution that works with existing schedule of every participant. Here are a few example tasks and solutions:\n\nTASK: You need to schedule a meeting for Diane, Kelly and Deborah for half an hour between the work hours of 9:00 to 17:00 on Monday. \n\nHere are the existing schedules for everyone during the day: \nDiane has meetings on Monday during 9:00 to 9:30, 12:00 to 12:30, 14:30 to 15:30; \nKelly has meetings on Monday during 9:30 to 10:00, 10:30 to 11:00; \nDeborah is busy on Monday during 9:00 to 9:30, 10:00 to 14:00, 14:30 to 17:00; \n\nFind a time that works for everyone's schedule and constraints. \nSOLUTION:",
      "response": "Monday 14:00–14:30 works for everyone.",
      "evaluation": {
        "response": "{\n  \"match\": true,\n  \"reason\": \"The candidate plan specifies Monday 14:00–14:30 for the same three participants (Diane, Kelly, Deborah), exactly matching the golden plan's proposed time and attendees.\"\n}",
        "label": 1
