PROBLEM
------------------------------
You are an expert at scheduling meetings. You are given a few constraints on the existing schedule of each participant, the meeting duration, and possibly some preferences on the meeting time. Note there exists a solution that works with existing schedule of every participant. Here are a few example tasks and solutions:

TASK: You need to schedule a meeting for Michelle, Steven and Jerry for one hour between the work hours of 9:00 to 17:00 on Monday. 

Here are the existing schedules for everyone during the day: 
Michelle has meetings on Monday during 11:00 to 12:00; 
Steven has blocked their calendar on Monday during 9:00 to 9:30, 11:30 to 12:00, 13:30 to 14:00, 15:30 to 16:00; 
Jerry has blocked their calendar on Monday during 9:00 to 9:30, 10:00 to 11:00, 11:30 to 12:30, 13:00 to 14:30, 15:30 to 16:00, 16:30 to 17:00; 

Find a time that works for everyone's schedule and constraints.

Inputs are availability summaries from each participant: First participant: {availability_michelle} Second participant: {availability_steven} Third participant: {availability_jerry}. Harmonize time slots as objects s0900, s0930, s1000, ..., s1630, s1700, and define next relations (e.g., next s0900 s0930, next s0930 s1000, etc.). Treat valid meeting start slots as those whose next successor remains within work hours (so last valid start is 16:00). Build a domain named meeting-scheduling with types person and slot, predicates such as free ?p - person ?s - slot, next ?s - slot ?t - slot, start-slot ?s - slot, committed-michelle ?s - slot ?t - slot, committed-steven ?s - slot ?t - slot, committed-jerry ?s - slot ?t - slot, and scheduled ?s - slot. Provide distinct actions commit-michelle, commit-steven, commit-jerry that each require next ?s ?t, start-slot ?s, and that the corresponding participant is free at both ?s and ?t; each action asserts the corresponding committed predicate. Provide a finalize action that, given a consecutive pair ?s ?t with all three committed predicates true, sets scheduled ?s. In the problem, declare objects for michelle, steven, jerry (type person) and all slot objects s0900 ... s1700 (type slot). Initialize next, start-slot, and free predicates based on the three availability inputs (free holds when all three participants are available at that slot; you may also keep free per participant and require it in the commit actions). Choose a feasible earliest start time consistent with all inputs so that the problem is solvable. Output only the PDDL domain and problem wrapped in the required tags."

Inputs are availability summaries from each participant: First participant: {availability_michelle} Second participant: {availability_steven} Third participant: {availability_jerry}. Harmonize time slots as objects s0900, s0930, s1000, ..., s1630, s1700, and define next relations (e.g., next s0900 s0930, next s0930 s1000, etc.). Treat valid meeting start slots as those whose next successor remains within work hours (so last valid start is 16:00). Build a domain named meeting-scheduling with types person and slot, predicates such as free ?p - person ?s - slot, next ?s - slot ?t - slot, start-slot ?s - slot, committed-michelle ?s - slot ?t - slot, committed-steven ?s - slot ?t - slot, committed-jerry ?s - slot ?t - slot, and scheduled ?s - slot. Provide distinct actions commit-michelle, commit-steven, commit-jerry that each require next ?s ?t, start-slot ?s, and that the corresponding participant is free at both ?s and ?t; each action asserts the corresponding committed predicate. Provide a finalize action that, given a consecutive pair ?s ?t with all three committed predicates true, sets scheduled ?s. In the problem, declare objects for michelle, steven, jerry (type person) and all slot objects s0900 ... s1700 (type slot). Initialize next, start-slot, and free predicates based on the three availability inputs (free holds when all three participants are available at that slot; you may also keep free per participant and require it in the commit actions). Choose a feasible earliest start time consistent with all inputs so that the problem is solvable. Output only the PDDL domain and problem wrapped in the required tags."

PROBLEM
------------------------------
You are an expert at scheduling meetings. You are given a few constraints on the existing schedule of each participant, the meeting duration, and possibly some preferences on the meeting time. Note there exists a solution that works with existing schedule of every participant. Here are a few example tasks and solutions:

TASK: You need to schedule a meeting for Raymond, Billy and Donald for half an hour between the work hours of 9:00 to 17:00 on Monday. 

Here are the existing schedules for everyone during the day: 
Raymond has blocked their calendar on Monday during 9:00 to 9:30, 11:30 to 12:00, 13:00 to 13:30, 15:00 to 15:30; 
Billy has meetings on Monday during 10:00 to 10:30, 12:00 to 13:00, 16:30 to 17:00; 
Donald has meetings on Monday during 9:00 to 9:30, 10:00 to 11:00, 12:00 to 13:00, 14:00 to 14:30, 16:00 to 17:00; 

Billy would like to avoid more meetings on Monday after 15:00. Find a time that works for everyone's schedule and constraints.

NATURAL-PLAN sas_plan_3
------------------------------
1) Schedule the meeting for Monday 09:30–10:00 (30 minutes) with Raymond, Billy, and Donald. [slot: s0930_1000]
================================================================================


PROBLEM
------------------------------
You are an expert at scheduling meetings. You are given a few constraints on the existing schedule of each participant, the meeting duration, and possibly some preferences on the meeting time. Note there exists a solution that works with existing schedule of every participant. Here are a few example tasks and solutions:

TASK: You need to schedule a meeting for Roy, Kathryn and Amy for half an hour between the work hours of 9:00 to 17:00 on Monday. 

Here are the existing schedules for everyone during the day: 
Roy has blocked their calendar on Monday during 9:00 to 9:30, 10:00 to 10:30, 11:00 to 11:30, 12:30 to 13:00; 
Kathryn has meetings on Monday during 9:30 to 10:00, 16:30 to 17:00; 
Amy has blocked their calendar on Monday during 9:00 to 14:30, 15:00 to 16:00, 16:30 to 17:00; 

Amy would rather not meet on Monday after 15:30. Find a time that works for everyone's schedule and constraints.

The domain should include actions sufficient to assign the meeting to a single free time slot (e.g., schedule(slot)) with preconditions that all participants are free at that slot and effects that the meeting is scheduled at that slot. The problem should define the time slots as objects (e.g., s09_00, s09_30, ...), encode which slots are within working hours, encode busy slots for each participant, include a preferred-slot predicate if relevant, and set the goal so that the plan schedules the meeting at a feasible slot consistent with the inputs.
