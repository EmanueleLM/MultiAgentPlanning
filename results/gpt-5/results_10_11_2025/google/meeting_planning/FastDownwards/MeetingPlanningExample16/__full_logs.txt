Represent time as discrete steps or via supported numeric constructs so that FastDownwards can solve it; if uncertain, prefer a discrete time progression with a finite horizon. Use clear object and predicate naming, avoid ambiguities, and only include objects present in the public information.",

No return travel needed to satisfy constraints.\n\nRationale: Given travel 22 min RD->FD, a single 5-minute wait primitive, and availability starting at 17:15, the earliest feasible meeting start aligned to the 5-minute grid is 17:17. This schedule then packs the maximum total meeting minutes achievable with 60-minute and 15-minute meeting actions without exceeding 21:45, yielding 255 minutes."

Time = 562 (09:22).\n- 09:22\u201317:17 (+475): Wait at Financial District in 5-minute increments. Time = 1037 (17:17).\n- 17:17\u201318:17 (+60): Meet Betty (meet-betty-60). Time = 1097 (18:17).

No return travel needed to satisfy constraints.\n\nRationale: Given travel 22 min RD->FD, a single 5-minute wait primitive, and availability starting at 17:15, the earliest feasible meeting start aligned to the 5-minute grid is 17:17. This schedule then packs the maximum total meeting minutes achievable with 60-minute and 15-minute meeting actions without exceeding 21:45, yielding 255 minutes."

No return travel needed to satisfy constraints.\n\nRationale: Given travel 22 min RD->FD, a single 5-minute wait primitive, and availability starting at 17:15, the earliest feasible meeting start aligned to the 5-minute grid is 17:17. This schedule then packs the maximum total meeting minutes achievable with 60-minute and 15-minute meeting actions without exceeding 21:45, yielding 255 minutes."

No return travel needed to satisfy constraints.\n\nRationale: Given travel 22 min RD->FD, a single 5-minute wait primitive, and availability starting at 17:15, the earliest feasible meeting start aligned to the 5-minute grid is 17:17. This schedule then packs the maximum total meeting minutes achievable with 60-minute and 15-minute meeting actions without exceeding 21:45, yielding 255 minutes."

Time = 562 (09:22).\n- 09:22\u201317:17 (+475): Wait at Financial District in 5-minute increments. Time = 1037 (17:17).\n- 17:17\u201318:17 (+60): Meet Betty (meet-betty-60). Time = 1097 (18:17).

No return travel needed to satisfy constraints.\n\nRationale: Given travel 22 min RD->FD, a single 5-minute wait primitive, and availability starting at 17:15, the earliest feasible meeting start aligned to the 5-minute grid is 17:17. This schedule then packs the maximum total meeting minutes achievable with 60-minute and 15-minute meeting actions without exceeding 21:45, yielding 255 minutes."

You must output a PDDL domain and a PDDL problem for the selected schedule. Always enclose the domain between <domain></domain> and the problem between <problem></problem>. Use a representation suitable for FastDownwards, for example classical PDDL with discretized time steps as objects or predicates. Encode locations, discrete timepoints, move actions with 10-minute steps, optional wait actions, and a meet action requiring occupancy at the same location across at least 60 consecutive minutes. Ensure initial state has the agent at Presidio at 09:00 and that Jessica is only present at Marina District within her window. The goal should include having met Jessica for at least 60 minutes within her availability window.",

Select the best audited schedule that maximizes total friend meetings and satisfies constraints. Then produce a PDDL domain and problem that capture the chosen schedule as a solvable planning instance for FastDownwards. Keep the modeling classical by discretizing time into 1-minute or 5-minute steps; ensure travel between Presidio and Marina District consumes 10 minutes in the model; ensure meeting with Jessica lasts at least 60 consecutive minutes occurring between 09:15 and 17:45.

Encode locations, discrete timepoints, move actions with 10-minute steps, optional wait actions, and a meet action requiring occupancy at the same location across at least 60 consecutive minutes. Ensure initial state has the agent at Presidio at 09:00 and that Jessica is only present at Marina District within her window. The goal should include having met Jessica for at least 60 minutes within her availability window.",
                    "prompt": "Inputs: availability model {availability_model}, candidate schedules {candidate_schedules}, and audit results {feasibility_audit}. Select the best audited schedule that maximizes total friend meetings and satisfies constraints. Then produce a PDDL domain and problem that capture the chosen schedule as a solvable planning instance for FastDownwards. Keep the modeling classical by discretizing time into 1-minute or 5-minute steps; ensure travel between Presidio and Marina District consumes 10 minutes in the model; ensure meeting with Jessica lasts at least 60 consecutive minutes occurring between 09:15 and 17:45. Enclose the domain in <domain></domain> and the problem in <problem></problem>."

Model: objects for locations and tick_i for a bounded horizon; a successor relation next(ti, tj); a unique current_time(ti) fluent advanced by an advance-time action; at(agent, location) to track position; begin-travel, travel-step, and arrive actions that consume time by chaining multiple steps equal to the discrete travel ticks per route; meeting actions that consume one tick per action; availability gating via can_meet_william(ti) predicates for the allowed ticks; initial state: current_time(t0) corresponding to 09:00 and at(agent, NobHill); goal: achieve met_william_5ticks (at least 5 meeting-tick actions = 75 minutes) by introducing a counter via staged predicates meet1..meet5 or an equivalent chaining approach. Keep the domain small but complete for Fast Downward. Do not include extraneous prose outside the tags.",
                    "prompt": "You are orchestrator. Goal: {agents->orchestrator->goal}. Inputs: candidate schedules: {candidate_schedules}; travel-time model: {travel_time_model}; audit: {audit_report}. 1) Select the auditor-recommended feasible schedule that satisfies the hard requirement to meet William for at least 75 minutes and aligns with maximizing friends met within the planning horizon. 2) Instantiate a PDDL domain and problem modeled with discrete 15-minute ticks and rounded-up travel durations as provided by the travel-time model. 3) Encode availability for William from 12:15PM onward using can_meet_william(ti) facts for those ticks. 4) Ensure the problem includes the bounded sequence of ticks from 09:00 to {environment->init->planning_horizon_end} with a next relation. 5) The goal must require at least five meeting ticks with William (e.g., via chained predicates meet1..meet5 leading to met_william_5ticks). 6) Enclose outputs within <domain></domain> and <problem></problem> and target Fast Downward's classical solver."

------------------------------
Here is the human-readable sequence that follows the provided plan exactly, with timestamps and durations:

1) 09:00–09:30 (30 min): Travel from Nob Hill to Sunset District. Directed travel time is 25 minutes; rounded up to one 30-minute slot. Travel cost accrued: +25.

2) 09:30–10:00 (30 min): Wait at Sunset District.

3) 10:00–10:30 (30 min): Wait at Sunset District.

4) 10:30–11:00 (30 min): Wait at Sunset District.

5) 11:00–11:30 (30 min): Wait at Sunset District.

6) 11:30–12:00 (30 min): Wait at Sunset District.

7) 12:00–12:30 (30 min): Wait at Sunset District.

8) 12:30–13:00 (30 min): Wait at Sunset District.

9) 13:00–13:30 (30 min): Wait at Sunset District.

10) 13:30–14:00 (30 min): Wait at Sunset District.

11) 14:00–14:30 (30 min): Start meeting with Carol at Sunset District (first contiguous slot).

12) 14:30–15:00 (30 min): Continue meeting with Carol (second contiguous slot).

13) 15:00–15:30 (30 min): Continue meeting with Carol and complete the required contiguous meeting (third contiguous slot, total 90 minutes).

Result: The contiguous meeting with Carol is completed (90 minutes ≥ 75-minute requirement). Total travel cost: 25 minutes.

Among them, this starts the meeting at 18:00 and uses the entire 18:00\u201321:30 window (210 minutes \u2265 90). It also avoids an unnecessary return leg, minimizing travel cost."

Among them, this starts the meeting at 18:00 and uses the entire 18:00\u201321:30 window (210 minutes \u2265 90). It also avoids an unnecessary return leg, minimizing travel cost."

To meet her at least 120 minutes entirely within 20:00\u201322:00, you must be at Marina District precisely at 20:00 and stay until 22:00. The above plan meets Mary for exactly 120 minutes, minimizes travel time (one 11-minute trip), and avoids unnecessary idle time at Marina District by waiting at Nob Hill until just before departure."

NATURAL-PLAN sas_plan_1
------------------------------
Here is the human-readable sequence of actions that follows the plan exactly:

1) Wait at Nob Hill from 09:00 to 19:49 (649 minutes).
2) Move from Nob Hill to Marina District: depart 19:49, arrive 20:00 (11 minutes travel).
3) Meet Mary at Marina District from 20:00 to 22:00 (120 minutes).

Result: At 22:00 you are at Marina District and have spent 120 minutes meeting Mary within her availability window.

NATURAL-PLAN sas_plan_2
------------------------------
1) Choose the best audited schedule (s1)
- Action: Select schedule s1 as the plan to follow.
- Effect: s1 becomes the selected schedule; no further choices allowed.
- Time: decision point (no duration).

2) Execute the meeting according to schedule s1
- Action: Follow schedule s1 to meet Ronald at Russian Hill.
- Duration: at least 105 minutes of continuous meeting.
- Timing: within Ronald’s availability window 15:15–21:30 in San Francisco (exact start/end per schedule s1).
