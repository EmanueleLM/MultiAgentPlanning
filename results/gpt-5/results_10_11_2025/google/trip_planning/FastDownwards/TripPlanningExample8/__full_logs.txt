PROBLEM
------------------------------
You plan to visit 3 European cities for 14 days in total. You only take direct flights to commute between cities. You would like to visit Florence for 6 days. You want to meet a friend in Florence between day 9 and day 14. You would like to visit Barcelona for 5 days. You would like to visit Helsinki for 5 days.

Here are the cities that have direct flights:
Barcelona and Florence, Helsinki and Barcelona.

NATURAL-PLAN sas_plan_3
------------------------------
Here is the human-readable sequence of actions, aligned exactly with the given plan and days (each step advances the trip by 1 day):

- Step 1 — Day 1 (d1→d2), duration: 1 day
  Stay in Helsinki.

- Step 2 — Day 2 (d2→d3), duration: 1 day
  Stay in Helsinki.

- Step 3 — Day 3 (d3→d4), duration: 1 day
  Fly direct from Helsinki to Barcelona; arrive by Day 4.

- Step 4 — Day 4 (d4→d5), duration: 1 day
  Stay in Barcelona.

- Step 5 — Day 5 (d5→d6), duration: 1 day
  Stay in Barcelona.

- Step 6 — Day 6 (d6→d7), duration: 1 day
  Stay in Barcelona.

- Step 7 — Day 7 (d7→d8), duration: 1 day
  Stay in Barcelona.

- Step 8 — Day 8 (d8→d9), duration: 1 day
  Fly direct from Barcelona to Florence; arrive by Day 9.

- Step 9 — Day 9 (d9→d10), duration: 1 day
  Stay in Florence.

- Step 10 — Day 10 (d10→d11), duration: 1 day
  Stay in Florence.

- Step 11 — Day 11 (d11→d12), duration: 1 day
  Stay in Florence.

Target FastDownward by using classical planning with :typing and :numeric-fluents. Represent days as a numeric fluent (days-remaining) initialized to 15. Represent per-city needs as numeric fluents (need-riga, need-manchester, need-split) initialized from the audit. Provide actions: fly(x,y) with preconditions at(x) and direct(x,y) and effects move the agent to y; stay(c) with preconditions at(c), (> days-remaining 0), (> need-c 0) and effects decrement both days-remaining and the relevant need by 1.

Here is the human-readable sequence of actions that follows the plan exactly. Each step corresponds to the transition between consecutive days.

1) Day 1 → Day 2: Stay in Berlin (no flight). Result: Day 2 in Berlin.
2) Day 2 → Day 3: Stay in Berlin (no flight). Result: Day 3 in Berlin.
3) Day 3 → Day 4: Stay in Berlin (no flight). Result: Day 4 in Berlin (conference day satisfied).
4) Day 4 → Day 5: Fly from Berlin to Munich (direct). Result: Day 5 in Munich.
5) Day 5 → Day 6: Fly from Munich to Dubrovnik (direct). Result: Day 6 in Dubrovnik.
6) Day 6 → Day 7: Stay in Dubrovnik (no flight). Result: Day 7 in Dubrovnik.
7) Day 7 → Day 8: Stay in Dubrovnik (no flight). Result: Day 8 in Dubrovnik.

PROBLEM
------------------------------
You plan to visit 3 European cities for 11 days in total. You only take direct flights to commute between cities. You plan to stay in Venice for 6 days. You would like to visit Dubrovnik for 4 days. You would like to visit Istanbul for 3 days.

Here are the cities that have direct flights:
from Dubrovnik to Istanbul, Istanbul and Venice.

Find a trip plan of visiting the cities for 11 days by taking direct flights to commute between them.

================================================================================


FINAL-PLAN
------------------------------
I’m missing the concrete data needed to build a solvable PDDL instance without inventing anything. Please provide the following so I can produce the final domain and problem exactly as requested:

- Cities and directed flight edges:
  - List all cities (e.g., c1, c2, …) and the directed flights allowed (from → to).
- Start and end conditions:
  - Start city for day 1.
  - Do you require ending in a specific city on day 11?
- Auditor report:
  - Did the auditor deem the original target infeasible?
  - If infeasible, provide the auditor’s recommended sequence of cities and the exact day allocations per city (e.g., CityA: 3 days, CityB: 2 days, … in a fixed order).
- Hard preferences to encode as constraints:
  - Any must-visit or must-avoid cities.
  - Any “earliest”, “at most”, or “exactly” constraints per city or segment.
  - Any ordered phases or sequences beyond the auditor’s recommendation.
- Misc:
  - Whether flights consume a whole day or travel occurs between days (I will default to each action advancing exactly one day unless you specify otherwise).

Once I have this, I will:
- Encode actions fly(from,to,day) only for listed edges and stay(city,day), each advancing to the next day, enforcing exactly 11 total days with explicit day objects and successor links.
- Enforce the auditor’s city sequence and exact day allocations as hard constraints so the solver cannot reorder or violate them.
- Provide a complete PDDL domain and problem compatible with Fast Downward, using only :strips, :typing, and :negative-preconditions.

NATURAL-PLAN sas_plan_1
------------------------------
Here is the human-readable sequence of actions following the plan exactly, with timestamps:

1) Stay in Dubrovnik from d0 to d1 (1 day)
2) Stay in Dubrovnik from d1 to d2 (1 day)
3) Stay in Dubrovnik from d2 to d3 (1 day)
4) Stay in Dubrovnik from d3 to d4 (1 day)
5) Fly from Dubrovnik to Venice at d4 (instantaneous)
6) Stay in Venice from d4 to d5 (1 day)
7) Stay in Venice from d5 to d6 (1 day)
8) Stay in Venice from d6 to d7 (1 day)
9) Stay in Venice from d7 to d8 (1 day)
10) Stay in Venice from d8 to d9 (1 day)
11) Stay in Venice from d9 to d10 (1 day)
12) Stay in Venice from d10 to d11 (1 day)

End state: Day d11 reached; total of 11 days elapsed with 4 days in Dubrovnik and 7 days in Venice.

PROBLEM
------------------------------
You plan to visit 3 European cities for 16 days in total. You only take direct flights to commute between cities. You want to spend 6 days in Krakow. You would like to visit Athens for 7 days. You plan to visit relatives in Athens between day 1 and day 7. You would like to visit Zurich for 5 days.

Here are the cities that have direct flights:
Zurich and Krakow, Athens and Zurich.

Find a trip plan of visiting the cities for 16 days by taking direct flights to commute between them.
