Here is the human-readable action sequence that follows the given plan exactly. Each step lists start time t (arbitrary units) and duration Δt=1.

1. t=0, Δt=1 — agent_1: move disk A from disk B to peg middle
2. t=1, Δt=1 — agent_1: move disk B from disk C to peg right
3. t=2, Δt=1 — agent_1: move disk A from peg middle to disk B
4. t=3, Δt=1 — agent_1: move disk C from disk D to peg middle
5. t=4, Δt=1 — agent_1: move disk A from disk B to disk D
6. t=5, Δt=1 — agent_1: move disk B from peg right to disk C
7. t=6, Δt=1 — agent_1: move disk A from disk D to disk B
8. t=7, Δt=1 — agent_1: move disk D from disk E to peg right
9. t=8, Δt=1 — agent_1: move disk A from disk B to disk E
10. t=9, Δt=1 — agent_1: move disk B from disk C to disk D
11. t=10, Δt=1 — agent_1: move disk A from disk E to disk B
12. t=11, Δt=1 — agent_1: move disk C from peg middle to disk E
13. t=12, Δt=1 — agent_1: move disk A from disk B to peg middle
14. t=13, Δt=1 — agent_1: move disk B from disk D to disk C
15. t=14, Δt=1 — agent_1: move disk A from peg middle to disk D
16. t=15, Δt=1 — agent_1: move disk B from disk C to peg middle
17. t=16, Δt=1 — agent_1: move disk A from disk D to disk B
18. t=17, Δt=1 — agent_1: move disk C from disk E to disk D
19. t=18, Δt=1 — agent_1: move disk A from disk B to disk E
20. t=19, Δt=1 — agent_1: move disk B from peg middle to disk C
21. t=20, Δt=1 — agent_1: move disk A from disk E to peg middle
