Here is the human-readable sequence that matches the given PDDL plan exactly. Each step shows the acting agent, the disk moved, its source and destination (peg or disk), and the stage timestamp [sX→sY].

1) [s0→s1] agent_1: move disk A from on top of disk B to the middle peg.
2) [s1→s2] agent_1: move disk B from on top of disk C to the right peg.
3) [s2→s3] agent_1: move disk A from the middle peg to sit on top of disk C.
4) [s3→s4] agent_1: move disk B from the right peg to the middle peg.
5) [s4→s5] agent_1: move disk A from on top of disk C to sit on top of disk B.
6) [s5→s6] agent_1: move disk C from on top of disk D to the right peg.
7) [s6→s7] agent_1: move disk A from on top of disk B to sit on top of disk C.
8) [s7→s8] agent_1: move disk B from the middle peg to sit on top of disk D.
9) [s8→s9] agent_1: move disk B from on top of disk D to the middle peg.
10) [s9→s10] agent_1: move disk B from the middle peg to sit on top of disk D.
11) [s10→s11] agent_1: move disk B from on top of disk D to the middle peg.
12) [s11→s12] agent_1: move disk B from the middle peg to sit on top of disk D.
13) [s12→s13] agent_1: move disk B from on top of disk D to the middle peg.
14) [s13→s14] agent_1: move disk B from the middle peg to sit on top of disk D.
15) [s14→s15] agent_1: move disk B from on top of disk D to the middle peg.
16) [s15→s16] agent_1: move disk B from the middle peg to sit on top of disk D.
17) [s16→s17] agent_1: move disk B from on top of disk D to the middle peg.
18) [s17→s18] agent_1: move disk B from the middle peg to sit on top of disk D.
19) [s18→s19] agent_1: move disk B from on top of disk D to the middle peg.
20) [s19→s20] agent_1: move disk A from on top of disk C to sit on top of disk B.
21) [s20→s21] agent_1: move disk C from the right peg to sit on top of disk D.
22) [s21→s22] agent_1: move disk A from on top of disk B to sit on top of disk C.
23) [s22→s23] agent_1: move disk B from the middle peg to the right peg.
24) [s23→s24] agent_1: move disk A from on top of disk C to sit on top of disk B.
25) [s24→s25] agent_1: move disk C from on top of disk D to the middle peg.
26) [s25→s26] agent_1: move disk A from on top of disk B to sit on top of disk C.
27) [s26→s27] agent_1: move disk B from the right peg to sit on top of disk D.
28) [s27→s28] agent_1: move disk A from on top of disk C to sit on top of disk B.
29) [s28→s29] agent_1: move disk A from on top of disk B to the right peg.
30) [s29→s30] agent_1: move disk B from on top of disk D to sit on top of disk C.
31) [s30→s31] agent_1: move disk A from the right peg to sit on top of disk B.
32) [s31→s32] agent_1: move disk D from on top of disk E to the right peg.
33) [s32→s33] agent_1: move disk A from on top of disk B to sit on top of disk E.
34) [s33→s34] agent_1: move disk B from on top of disk C to sit on top of disk D.
35) [s34→s35] agent_1: move disk A from on top of disk E to sit on top of disk C.
36) [s35→s36] agent_1: move disk B from on top of disk D to sit on top of disk E.
37) [s36→s37] agent_1: move disk A from on top of disk C to sit on top of disk B.
38) [s37→s38] agent_1: move disk C from the middle peg to sit on top of disk D.
39) [s38→s39] agent_1: move disk A from on top of disk B to sit on top of disk C.

Resulting final configuration:
- Left peg (top→bottom): B, E, F, G, H, I, J
- Middle peg: empty
- Right peg (top→bottom): A, C, D

All moves adhere to the agent capability constraints (only A–E moved by agent_1) and Tower of Hanoi legality.
