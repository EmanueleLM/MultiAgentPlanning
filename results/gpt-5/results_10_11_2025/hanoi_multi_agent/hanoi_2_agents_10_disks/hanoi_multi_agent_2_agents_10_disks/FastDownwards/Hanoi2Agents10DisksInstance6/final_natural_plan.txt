Here is the human-readable action sequence, following the plan exactly:

1. [t=00:00] agent_1 moves disk a from on disk b to the right peg.
2. [t=00:01] agent_1 moves disk b from on disk c to the middle peg.
3. [t=00:02] agent_1 moves disk a from the right peg onto disk b.
4. [t=00:03] agent_1 moves disk c from on disk d to the right peg.
5. [t=00:04] agent_1 moves disk a from on disk b onto disk d.
6. [t=00:05] agent_1 moves disk b from the middle peg onto disk c.
7. [t=00:06] agent_1 moves disk a from on disk d onto disk b.
8. [t=00:07] agent_1 moves disk d from on disk e to the middle peg.
9. [t=00:08] agent_1 moves disk a from on disk b onto disk d.
10. [t=00:09] agent_1 moves disk b from on disk c onto disk e.
11. [t=00:10] agent_1 moves disk a from on disk d onto disk b.
12. [t=00:11] agent_1 moves disk c from the right peg onto disk d.
13. [t=00:12] agent_1 moves disk a from on disk b onto disk c.
14. [t=00:13] agent_1 moves disk b from on disk e to the right peg.
15. [t=00:14] agent_1 moves disk a from on disk c onto disk b.
16. [t=00:15] agent_1 moves disk c from on disk d onto disk e.
17. [t=00:16] agent_1 moves disk a from on disk b onto disk d.
18. [t=00:17] agent_1 moves disk b from the right peg onto disk c.
19. [t=00:18] agent_1 moves disk a from on disk d onto disk b.
20. [t=00:19] agent_1 moves disk d from the middle peg to the right peg.
21. [t=00:20] agent_1 moves disk a from on disk b onto disk d.
22. [t=00:21] agent_1 moves disk b from on disk c to the middle peg.

Result: Goal configuration achieved (right peg has d with a on it; middle peg has b; left peg retains c on e on f on g on h on i on j).
