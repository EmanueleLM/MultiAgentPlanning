Here is the human-readable sequence of actions that follows the given plan exactly. Each move takes 1 unit of time (total cost = 8).

1) t=0→1 — agent_1 moves disk A from on top of disk B to the right peg.
2) t=1→2 — agent_1 moves disk B from on top of disk C to the middle peg.
3) t=2→3 — agent_1 moves disk A from the right peg to on top of disk B.
4) t=3→4 — agent_1 moves disk C from on top of disk D to the right peg.
5) t=4→5 — agent_1 moves disk A from on top of disk B to on top of disk C.
6) t=5→6 — agent_1 moves disk B from the middle peg to on top of disk D.
7) t=6→7 — agent_1 moves disk A from on top of disk C to on top of disk B.
8) t=7→8 — agent_1 moves disk C from the right peg to the middle peg.

Result: Disk C is on the middle peg; disks A and B are restored to the top of the left stack (A on B on D on E on F on G on H on I on J); the right peg is empty.
