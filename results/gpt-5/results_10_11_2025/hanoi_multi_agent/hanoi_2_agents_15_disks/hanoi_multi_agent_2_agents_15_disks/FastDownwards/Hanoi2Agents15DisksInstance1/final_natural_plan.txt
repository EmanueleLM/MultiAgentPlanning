Here is the human-readable execution of the plan, aligned with each stage transition (Δt = 1 per move):

- s0→s1: agent_1: move disk A from left to middle
- s1→s2: agent_1: move disk B from left to right
- s2→s3: agent_1: move disk A from middle to left
- s3→s4: agent_1: move disk B from right to middle
- s4→s5: agent_1: move disk A from left to middle
- s5→s6: agent_1: move disk C from left to right
- s6→s7: agent_1: move disk A from middle to left
- s7→s8: agent_1: move disk B from middle to right
- s8→s9: agent_1: move disk A from left to right
- s9→s10: agent_1: move disk D from left to middle
- s10→s11: agent_1: move disk A from right to middle
- s11→s12: agent_1: move disk B from right to left
- s12→s13: agent_1: move disk A from middle to right

Resulting configuration:
- Left: B, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, O
- Middle: D
- Right: A, C

Goal achieved.
