PROBLEM
------------------------------
Devise a cooperative plan for a 2-agent Tower of Hanoi with 20 disks labelled A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, O, P, Q, R, S, T (A is the smallest, T the largest). Agents are limited to moving specific disks: agent_1 ⇒ A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J; agent_2 ⇒ K, L, M, N, O, P, Q, R, S, T. Initial configuration: left peg has (top→bottom) A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, O, P, Q, R, S, T; middle peg is empty; right peg is empty. Goal configuration: left peg has (top→bottom) A, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, O, P, Q, R, S, T; middle peg has (top→bottom) D; right peg has (top→bottom) B, C. Provide an ordered list of primitive moves in the format 'agent_i: move disk X from peg1 to peg2', respecting the agent restrictions and the Tower of Hanoi rules.

PROBLEM
------------------------------
Devise a cooperative plan for a 2-agent Tower of Hanoi with 20 disks labelled A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, O, P, Q, R, S, T (A is the smallest, T the largest). Agents are limited to moving specific disks: agent_1 ⇒ A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J; agent_2 ⇒ K, L, M, N, O, P, Q, R, S, T. Initial configuration: left peg has (top→bottom) A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, O, P, Q, R, S, T; middle peg is empty; right peg is empty. Goal configuration: left peg has (top→bottom) B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, O, P, Q, R, S, T; middle peg has (top→bottom) A; right peg is empty. Provide an ordered list of primitive moves in the format 'agent_i: move disk X from peg1 to peg2', respecting the agent restrictions and the Tower of Hanoi rules.
