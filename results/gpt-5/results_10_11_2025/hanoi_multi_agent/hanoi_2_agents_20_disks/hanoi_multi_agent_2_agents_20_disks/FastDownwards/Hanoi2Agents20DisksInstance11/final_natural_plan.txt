Here is the human-readable sequence of actions matching the provided plan:

1. [s1→s2] agent_1 moves disk A from left to right (onto empty right peg).
2. [s2→s3] agent_1 moves disk B from left to middle (onto empty middle peg).
3. [s3→s4] agent_1 moves disk A from right to middle (placing it onto disk B).
4. [s4→s5] agent_1 moves disk C from left to right (onto empty right peg).
5. [s5→s6] agent_1 moves disk A from middle to left (placing it onto disk D).
6. [s6→s7] agent_1 moves disk B from middle to right (placing it onto disk C).
7. [s7→s8] agent_1 moves disk A from left to right (placing it onto disk B).
8. [s8→s9] agent_1 moves disk D from left to middle (onto empty middle peg).
9. [s9→s10] agent_1 moves disk A from right to left (placing it onto disk E).
10. [s10→s11] agent_1 moves disk B from right to middle (placing it onto disk D).
11. [s11→s12] agent_1 moves disk A from left to middle (placing it onto disk B).
12. [s12→s13] agent_1 moves disk C from right to left (placing it onto disk E).
13. [s13→s14] agent_1 moves disk A from middle to left (placing it onto disk C).
14. [final s14] agent_1 moves disk B from middle to right (onto empty right peg).

Result: left peg has A on C on E on F on G on H on I on J on K on L on M on N on O on P on Q on R on S on T; middle peg has D; right peg has B.
