Here is the human-readable action sequence that follows the provided plan exactly. All moves are performed by agent_1 (who is permitted to move disks A–J). Each step has a unit duration and a monotonically increasing timestamp.

1) t=0, duration=1 — agent_1: move disk A from left to middle
2) t=1, duration=1 — agent_1: move disk B from left to right
3) t=2, duration=1 — agent_1: move disk A from middle to right
4) t=3, duration=1 — agent_1: move disk C from left to middle
5) t=4, duration=1 — agent_1: move disk A from right to left
6) t=5, duration=1 — agent_1: move disk B from right to middle
7) t=6, duration=1 — agent_1: move disk A from left to middle
8) t=7, duration=1 — agent_1: move disk D from left to right
9) t=8, duration=1 — agent_1: move disk A from middle to left
10) t=9, duration=1 — agent_1: move disk B from middle to right
11) t=10, duration=1 — agent_1: move disk A from left to right
12) t=11, duration=1 — agent_1: move disk C from middle to left
13) t=12, duration=1 — agent_1: move disk A from right to middle
14) t=13, duration=1 — agent_1: move disk B from right to left
15) t=14, duration=1 — agent_1: move disk A from middle to right

This sequence achieves the goal: right peg has A on D, left peg has B–T in order, and middle peg is empty.
