Here is the human-readable action sequence that follows the plan exactly and respects all constraints. Each step assumes a duration of 1 time unit.

1) t=00:00–00:01 (duration: 1)
   agent_1: move disk A from left to middle

2) t=00:01–00:02 (duration: 1)
   agent_1: move disk B from left to right

3) t=00:02–00:03 (duration: 1)
   agent_1: move disk A from middle to right

4) t=00:03–00:04 (duration: 1)
   agent_1: move disk C from left to middle

Result: right peg has A on B; middle peg has C; left peg has D through T (top→bottom), matching the goal.
