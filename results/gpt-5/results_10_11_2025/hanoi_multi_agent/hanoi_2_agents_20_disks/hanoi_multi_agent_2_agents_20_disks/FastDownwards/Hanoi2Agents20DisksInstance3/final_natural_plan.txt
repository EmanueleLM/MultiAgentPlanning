Here is the human-readable action sequence that follows the provided plan exactly. Each step lists the stage transition as a timestamp and assumes unit duration.

1) [s0 → s1, duration 1] agent_1: move disk A from atop disk B to peg middle.
2) [s1 → s2, duration 1] agent_1: move disk B from atop disk C to peg right.
3) [s2 → s3, duration 1] agent_1: move disk A from peg middle onto disk B.
4) [s3 → s4, duration 1] agent_1: move disk C from atop disk D to peg middle.
5) [s4 → s5, duration 1] agent_1: move disk A from atop disk B onto disk D.
6) [s5 → s6, duration 1] agent_1: move disk B from peg right onto disk C.
7) [s6 → s7, duration 1] agent_1: move disk A from atop disk D onto disk B.
8) [s7 → s8, duration 1] agent_1: move disk D from atop disk E to peg right.
9) [s8 → s9, duration 1] agent_1: move disk A from atop disk B onto disk D.
10) [s9 → s10, duration 1] agent_1: move disk B from atop disk C onto disk E.
