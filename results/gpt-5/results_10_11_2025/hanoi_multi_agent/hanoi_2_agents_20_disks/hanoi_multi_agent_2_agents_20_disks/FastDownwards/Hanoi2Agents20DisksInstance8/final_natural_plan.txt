Here is the final, ordered sequence of human-readable actions matching the PDDL plan. Each move is one time unit; timestamps are in discrete time units.

1. [t=0, duration=1] agent_1: move disk A from left to middle
2. [t=1, duration=1] agent_1: move disk B from left to right
3. [t=2, duration=1] agent_1: move disk A from middle to left
4. [t=3, duration=1] agent_1: move disk A from left to right
5. [t=4, duration=1] agent_1: move disk C from left to middle
6. [t=5, duration=1] agent_1: move disk A from right to middle
7. [t=6, duration=1] agent_1: move disk B from right to left
8. [t=7, duration=1] agent_1: move disk A from middle to left
9. [t=8, duration=1] agent_1: move disk C from middle to right
10. [t=9, duration=1] agent_1: move disk A from left to middle
11. [t=10, duration=1] agent_1: move disk B from left to right
12. [t=11, duration=1] agent_1: move disk A from middle to right
13. [t=12, duration=1] agent_1: move disk D from left to middle
14. [t=13, duration=1] agent_1: move disk A from right to middle
15. [t=14, duration=1] agent_1: move disk B from right to left
16. [t=15, duration=1] agent_1: move disk A from middle to right
17. [t=16, duration=1] agent_1: move disk B from left to middle
18. [t=17, duration=1] agent_1: move disk A from right to middle
19. [t=18, duration=1] agent_1: move disk C from right to left
20. [t=19, duration=1] agent_1: move disk A from middle to left
21. [t=20, duration=1] agent_1: move disk B from middle to right

Resulting configuration:
- Left peg: A, C, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, O, P, Q, R, S, T (top→bottom)
- Middle peg: D
- Right peg: B

All moves obey the Tower of Hanoi rules and agent constraints.
