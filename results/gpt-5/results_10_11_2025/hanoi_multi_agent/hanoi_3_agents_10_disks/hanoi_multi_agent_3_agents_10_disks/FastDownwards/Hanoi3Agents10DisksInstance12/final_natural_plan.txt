Here is the human-readable sequence of actions that follows the plan exactly and achieves the goal. Each step is sequential; assume duration = 1 time unit per move.

1) t=0, dur=1 — agent_1: move disk A from on top of B on the left peg to the right peg.
2) t=1, dur=1 — agent_1: move disk B from on top of C on the left peg to the middle peg.
3) t=2, dur=1 — agent_1: move disk A from the right peg onto disk B on the middle peg.
4) t=3, dur=1 — agent_1: move disk C from on top of D on the left peg to the right peg.
5) t=4, dur=1 — agent_1: move disk A from on top of B on the middle peg onto disk D on the left peg.
6) t=5, dur=1 — agent_1: move disk B from the middle peg onto disk C on the right peg.
7) t=6, dur=1 — agent_1: move disk A from on top of D on the left peg onto disk B on the right peg.
8) t=7, dur=1 — agent_1: move disk D from on top of E on the left peg to the middle peg.
