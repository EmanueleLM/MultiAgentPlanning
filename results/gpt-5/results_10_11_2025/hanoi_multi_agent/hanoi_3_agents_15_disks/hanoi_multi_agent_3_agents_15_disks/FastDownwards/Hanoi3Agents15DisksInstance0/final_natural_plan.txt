Here is the human-readable execution of the plan, with unit-time steps (duration = 1) and timestamps t=0..15:

1. t=0→1 (duration 1): agent_1: move disk A from left to middle
2. t=1→2 (duration 1): agent_1: move disk B from left to right
3. t=2→3 (duration 1): agent_1: move disk A from middle to right
4. t=3→4 (duration 1): agent_1: move disk C from left to middle
5. t=4→5 (duration 1): agent_1: move disk A from right to left
6. t=5→6 (duration 1): agent_1: move disk B from right to middle
7. t=6→7 (duration 1): agent_1: move disk A from left to middle
8. t=7→8 (duration 1): agent_1: move disk D from left to right
9. t=8→9 (duration 1): agent_1: move disk A from middle to left
10. t=9→10 (duration 1): agent_1: move disk B from middle to right
11. t=10→11 (duration 1): agent_1: move disk A from left to right
12. t=11→12 (duration 1): agent_1: move disk C from middle to left
13. t=12→13 (duration 1): agent_1: move disk A from right to left
14. t=13→14 (duration 1): agent_1: move disk B from right to middle
15. t=14→15 (duration 1): agent_1: move disk A from left to right

Total duration: 15 units. This sequence achieves the specified goal configuration.
