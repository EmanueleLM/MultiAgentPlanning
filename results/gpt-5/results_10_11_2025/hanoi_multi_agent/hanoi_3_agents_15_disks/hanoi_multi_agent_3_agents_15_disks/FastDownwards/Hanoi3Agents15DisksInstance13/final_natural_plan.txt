Here is the human-readable action sequence that follows the provided plan exactly:

1. [t=1] agent_1: move disk A from left to middle
2. [t=2] agent_1: move disk B from left to right
3. [t=3] agent_1: move disk A from middle to right
4. [t=4] agent_1: move disk C from left to middle
5. [t=5] agent_1: move disk A from right to left
6. [t=6] agent_1: move disk B from right to middle
7. [t=7] agent_1: move disk A from left to middle
8. [t=8] agent_1: move disk A from middle to right
9. [t=9] agent_1: move disk B from middle to left

Resulting configuration after step 9 (matches the goal):
- Left peg: B on top of D, then D–O below (same order as initially), with B on top
- Middle peg: C only
- Right peg: A only
