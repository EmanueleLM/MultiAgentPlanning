Here is the ordered sequence of primitive actions, aligned exactly with the plan. Each action takes 1 unit step and is timestamped by the step transition.

1. [s0→s1 | duration: 1] agent_1: move disk A from left to middle
2. [s1→s2 | duration: 1] agent_1: move disk B from left to right
3. [s2→s3 | duration: 1] agent_1: move disk A from middle to right
4. [s3→s4 | duration: 1] agent_1: move disk C from left to middle
5. [s4→s5 | duration: 1] agent_1: move disk A from right to left
6. [s5→s6 | duration: 1] agent_1: move disk B from right to middle
7. [s6→s7 | duration: 1] agent_1: move disk A from left to middle
8. [s7→s8 | duration: 1] agent_1: move disk D from left to right
9. [s8→s9 | duration: 1] agent_1: move disk A from middle to right
10. [s9→s10 | duration: 1] agent_1: move disk B from middle to left
11. [s10→s11 | duration: 1] agent_1: move disk A from right to left
12. [s11→s12 | duration: 1] agent_1: move disk C from middle to right
13. [s12→s13 | duration: 1] agent_1: move disk A from left to right
14. [s13→s14 | duration: 1] agent_1: move disk B from left to middle
