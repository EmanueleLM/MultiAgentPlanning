Here is the human-readable action sequence, matching the provided plan exactly:

1. [s0→s1] agent_1: Move disk A from on disk B (left peg) to the right peg.
2. [s1→s2] agent_1: Move disk B from on disk C (left peg) to the middle peg.
3. [s2→s3] agent_1: Move disk A from the right peg to on disk B (middle peg).
4. [s3→s4] agent_1: Move disk C from on disk D (left peg) to the right peg.
5. [s4→s5] agent_1: Move disk A from on disk B (middle peg) to on disk D (left peg).
6. [s5→s6] agent_1: Move disk B from the middle peg to on disk C (right peg).
7. [s6→s7] agent_1: Move disk A from on disk D (left peg) to on disk B (right peg).
8. [s7→s8] agent_1: Move disk D from on disk E (left peg) to the middle peg.
9. [s8→s9] agent_1: Move disk A from on disk B (right peg) to on disk E (left peg).
10. [s9→s10] agent_1: Move disk B from on disk C (right peg) to on disk D (middle peg).
11. [s10→s11] agent_1: Move disk A from on disk E (left peg) to on disk B (middle peg).
12. [s11→s12] agent_1: Move disk C from the right peg to on disk E (left peg).
13. [s12→s13] agent_1: Move disk A from on disk B (middle peg) to on disk C (left peg).

Final configuration achieved: left peg has (top→bottom) A, C, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, O; middle peg has (top→bottom) B, D; right peg is empty.
