Here is the audited human-readable sequence that mirrors the given PDDL plan exactly. Each action is sequential and takes 1 time unit.

1. [t=0 → 1] agent_1: move disk A from on top of B to the middle peg.
2. [t=1 → 2] agent_1: move disk B from on top of C to the right peg.
3. [t=2 → 3] agent_1: move disk A from the middle peg to on top of C.
4. [t=3 → 4] agent_1: move disk A from on top of C to on top of B.
5. [t=4 → 5] agent_1: move disk C from on top of D to the middle peg.
6. [t=5 → 6] agent_1: move disk A from on top of B to on top of C.
7. [t=6 → 7] agent_1: move disk B from the right peg to on top of D.
8. [t=7 → 8] agent_1: move disk A from on top of C to the right peg.
9. [t=8 → 9] agent_1: move disk B from on top of D to on top of C.
10. [t=9 → 10] agent_1: move disk A from the right peg to on top of B.
11. [t=10 → 11] agent_1: move disk D from on top of E to the right peg.
12. [t=11 → 12] agent_1: move disk A from on top of B to on top of E.
13. [t=12 → 13] agent_1: move disk B from on top of C to on top of D.
14. [t=13 → 14] agent_1: move disk A from on top of E to on top of C.
15. [t=14 → 15] agent_1: move disk A from on top of C to on top of B.
16. [t=15 → 16] agent_1: move disk C from the middle peg to on top of E.
17. [t=16 → 17] agent_1: move disk A from on top of B to on top of C.
18. [t=17 → 18] agent_1: move disk B from on top of D to the middle peg.
19. [t=18 → 19] agent_1: move disk A from on top of C to on top of B.
20. [t=19 → 20] agent_1: move disk C from on top of E to on top of D.
21. [t=20 → 21] agent_1: move disk A from on top of B to on top of C.

Result: Disks E..O remain stacked on the left peg; disk D is on the right peg; disk C is on D; disk A is on C; disk B is alone on the middle peg. This matches the goal configuration.
