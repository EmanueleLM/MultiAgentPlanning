Here is the human-readable action sequence that follows the given plan exactly. Each step shows the stage timestamp transition and single-step duration.

1. [s0 → s1 | Δ1] agent_1 moves disk A from the left peg (off disk B) to the right peg.
2. [s1 → s2 | Δ1] agent_1 moves disk B from the left peg (off disk C) to the middle peg.
3. [s2 → s3 | Δ1] agent_1 moves disk A from the right peg to the middle peg, onto disk B.
4. [s3 → s4 | Δ1] agent_1 moves disk C from the left peg (off disk D) to the right peg.
5. [s4 → s5 | Δ1] agent_1 moves disk A from the middle peg to the left peg, onto disk D.
6. [s5 → s6 | Δ1] agent_1 moves disk B from the middle peg to the right peg, onto disk C.
7. [s6 → s7 | Δ1] agent_1 moves disk A from the left peg to the right peg, onto disk B.
8. [s7 → s8 | Δ1] agent_1 moves disk D from the left peg (off disk E) to the middle peg.
9. [s8 → s9 | Δ1] agent_1 moves disk A from the right peg to the middle peg, onto disk D.
10. [s9 → s10 | Δ1] agent_1 moves disk B from the right peg (off disk C) to the left peg, onto disk E.
11. [s10 → s11 | Δ1] agent_1 moves disk A from the middle peg to the left peg, onto disk B.
12. [s11 → s12 | Δ1] agent_1 moves disk C from the right peg to the middle peg, onto disk D.

Final configuration after step 12:
- Left peg (top to bottom): A, B, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, O, P, Q, R, S, T
- Middle peg (top to bottom): C, D
- Right peg: empty
