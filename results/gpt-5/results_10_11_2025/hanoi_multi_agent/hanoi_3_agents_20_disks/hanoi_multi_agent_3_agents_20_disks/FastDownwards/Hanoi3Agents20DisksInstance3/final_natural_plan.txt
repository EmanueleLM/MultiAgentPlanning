Here is the human-readable move sequence that follows the plan exactly. Each move is one unit of time; timestamps show start→end.

1) [t=0→1] agent_1: move disk A from on disk B to peg middle
2) [t=1→2] agent_1: move disk B from on disk C to peg right
3) [t=2→3] agent_1: move disk A from peg middle to on disk B
4) [t=3→4] agent_1: move disk C from on disk D to peg middle
5) [t=4→5] agent_1: move disk A from on disk B to on disk D
6) [t=5→6] agent_1: move disk A from on disk D to on disk C
7) [t=6→7] agent_1: move disk B from peg right to on disk D
8) [t=7→8] agent_1: move disk A from on disk C to on disk B
9) [t=8→9] agent_1: move disk C from peg middle to peg right
10) [t=9→10] agent_1: move disk A from on disk B to peg middle
11) [t=10→11] agent_1: move disk B from on disk D to on disk C
12) [t=11→12] agent_1: move disk A from peg middle to on disk B
13) [t=12→13] agent_1: move disk D from on disk E to peg middle
14) [t=13→14] agent_1: move disk A from on disk B to on disk E
15) [t=14→15] agent_1: move disk B from on disk C to on disk D

Resulting configuration:
- Left peg (top→bottom): A, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, O, P, Q, R, S, T
- Middle peg (top→bottom): B, D
- Right peg: C

All moves respect agent permissions and Tower of Hanoi rules.
