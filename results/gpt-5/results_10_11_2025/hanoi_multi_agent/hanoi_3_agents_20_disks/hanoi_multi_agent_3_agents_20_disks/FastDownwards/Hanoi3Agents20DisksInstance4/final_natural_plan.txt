Here is the human-readable sequence of actions that exactly follows the plan, with stage timestamps:

1) [s0→s1] agent_1: move disk A from left to middle
2) [s1→s2] agent_1: move disk B from left to right
3) [s2→s3] agent_1: move disk A from middle to right
4) [s3→s4] agent_1: move disk C from left to middle
5) [s4→s5] agent_1: move disk A from right to left
6) [s5→s6] agent_1: move disk B from right to middle
7) [s6→s7] agent_1: move disk A from left to middle
8) [s7→s8] agent_1: move disk D from left to right
9) [s8→s9] agent_1: move disk A from middle to right
10) [s9→s10] agent_1: move disk B from middle to left
11) [s10→s11] agent_1: move disk A from right to left
12) [s11→s12] agent_1: move disk C from middle to right
13) [s12→s13] agent_1: move disk A from left to middle
14) [s13→s14] agent_1: move disk B from left to right

Resulting configuration at s14: left has E..T, middle has A, right has B on C on D.
