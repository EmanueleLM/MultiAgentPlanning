PROBLEM
------------------------------
Devise a cooperative plan for a 3-agent Tower of Hanoi with 20 disks labelled A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, O, P, Q, R, S, T (A is the smallest, T the largest). Agents are limited to moving specific disks: agent_1 ⇒ A, B, C, D, E, F, G; agent_2 ⇒ H, I, J, K, L, M, N; agent_3 ⇒ O, P, Q, R, S, T. Initial configuration: left peg has (top→bottom) A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, O, P, Q, R, S, T; middle peg is empty; right peg is empty. Goal configuration: left peg has (top→bottom) C, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, O, P, Q, R, S, T; middle peg has (top→bottom) B; right peg has (top→bottom) A, D. Provide an ordered list of primitive moves in the format 'agent_i: move disk X from peg1 to peg2', respecting the agent restrictions and the Tower of Hanoi rules.

PROBLEM
------------------------------
Devise a cooperative plan for a 3-agent Tower of Hanoi with 20 disks labelled A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, O, P, Q, R, S, T (A is the smallest, T the largest). Agents are limited to moving specific disks: agent_1 ⇒ A, B, C, D, E, F, G; agent_2 ⇒ H, I, J, K, L, M, N; agent_3 ⇒ O, P, Q, R, S, T. Initial configuration: left peg has (top→bottom) A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, O, P, Q, R, S, T; middle peg is empty; right peg is empty. Goal configuration: left peg has (top→bottom) C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, O, P, Q, R, S, T; middle peg has (top→bottom) A, B; right peg is empty. Provide an ordered list of primitive moves in the format 'agent_i: move disk X from peg1 to peg2', respecting the agent restrictions and the Tower of Hanoi rules.

PROBLEM
------------------------------
Devise a cooperative plan for a 3-agent Tower of Hanoi with 20 disks labelled A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, O, P, Q, R, S, T (A is the smallest, T the largest). Agents are limited to moving specific disks: agent_1 ⇒ A, B, C, D, E, F, G; agent_2 ⇒ H, I, J, K, L, M, N; agent_3 ⇒ O, P, Q, R, S, T. Initial configuration: left peg has (top→bottom) A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, O, P, Q, R, S, T; middle peg is empty; right peg is empty. Goal configuration: left peg has (top→bottom) D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, O, P, Q, R, S, T; middle peg has (top→bottom) A, B, C; right peg is empty. Provide an ordered list of primitive moves in the format 'agent_i: move disk X from peg1 to peg2', respecting the agent restrictions and the Tower of Hanoi rules.

NATURAL-PLAN sas_plan_1
------------------------------
Here is the human-readable action sequence that follows the plan exactly, with simple timestamps and 1-unit durations:

1) t=0s–1s (duration 1s) — agent_1: move disk A from disk B to the middle peg
2) t=1s–2s (duration 1s) — agent_1: move disk B from disk C to the right peg
3) t=2s–3s (duration 1s) — agent_1: move disk A from the middle peg to disk B
4) t=3s–4s (duration 1s) — agent_1: move disk C from disk D to the middle peg
5) t=4s–5s (duration 1s) — agent_1: move disk A from disk B to disk D
6) t=5s–6s (duration 1s) — agent_1: move disk B from the right peg to disk C
7) t=6s–7s (duration 1s) — agent_1: move disk A from disk D to disk B
================================================================================


PROBLEM
------------------------------
Devise a cooperative plan for a 3-agent Tower of Hanoi with 20 disks labelled A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, O, P, Q, R, S, T (A is the smallest, T the largest). Agents are limited to moving specific disks: agent_1 ⇒ A, B, C, D, E, F, G; agent_2 ⇒ H, I, J, K, L, M, N; agent_3 ⇒ O, P, Q, R, S, T. Initial configuration: left peg has (top→bottom) A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, O, P, Q, R, S, T; middle peg is empty; right peg is empty. Goal configuration: left peg has (top→bottom) A, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, O, P, Q, R, S, T; middle peg has (top→bottom) B, D; right peg has (top→bottom) C. Provide an ordered list of primitive moves in the format 'agent_i: move disk X from peg1 to peg2', respecting the agent restrictions and the Tower of Hanoi rules.

Initialize all disks stacked on the left peg from top to bottom A through T. Set the goal to the specified configuration where left has A, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, O, P, Q, R, S, T in that order from top to bottom, middle has B on D from top to bottom, and right has C.

NATURAL-PLAN sas_plan_2
------------------------------
Here is the human-readable move sequence that follows the plan exactly. Each move is one unit of time; timestamps show start→end.

1) [t=0→1] agent_1: move disk A from on disk B to peg middle
2) [t=1→2] agent_1: move disk B from on disk C to peg right
3) [t=2→3] agent_1: move disk A from peg middle to on disk B
4) [t=3→4] agent_1: move disk C from on disk D to peg middle
5) [t=4→5] agent_1: move disk A from on disk B to on disk D
6) [t=5→6] agent_1: move disk A from on disk D to on disk C
7) [t=6→7] agent_1: move disk B from peg right to on disk D
8) [t=7→8] agent_1: move disk A from on disk C to on disk B
9) [t=8→9] agent_1: move disk C from peg middle to peg right
10) [t=9→10] agent_1: move disk A from on disk B to peg middle
11) [t=10→11] agent_1: move disk B from on disk D to on disk C
12) [t=11→12] agent_1: move disk A from peg middle to on disk B
13) [t=12→13] agent_1: move disk D from on disk E to peg middle
14) [t=13→14] agent_1: move disk A from on disk B to on disk E
15) [t=14→15] agent_1: move disk B from on disk C to on disk D

Resulting configuration:
- Left peg (top→bottom): A, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, O, P, Q, R, S, T
- Middle peg (top→bottom): B, D
- Right peg: C

All moves respect agent permissions and Tower of Hanoi rules.

PROBLEM
------------------------------
Devise a cooperative plan for a 3-agent Tower of Hanoi with 20 disks labelled A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, O, P, Q, R, S, T (A is the smallest, T the largest). Agents are limited to moving specific disks: agent_1 ⇒ A, B, C, D, E, F, G; agent_2 ⇒ H, I, J, K, L, M, N; agent_3 ⇒ O, P, Q, R, S, T. Initial configuration: left peg has (top→bottom) A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, O, P, Q, R, S, T; middle peg is empty; right peg is empty. Goal configuration: left peg has (top→bottom) E, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, O, P, Q, R, S, T; middle peg has (top→bottom) A; right peg has (top→bottom) B, C, D. Provide an ordered list of primitive moves in the format 'agent_i: move disk X from peg1 to peg2', respecting the agent restrictions and the Tower of Hanoi rules.

NATURAL-PLAN sas_plan_10
------------------------------
Here is the human-readable sequence of actions that exactly follows the plan, with stage timestamps:

1) [s0→s1] agent_1: move disk A from left to middle
2) [s1→s2] agent_1: move disk B from left to right
3) [s2→s3] agent_1: move disk A from middle to right
4) [s3→s4] agent_1: move disk C from left to middle
5) [s4→s5] agent_1: move disk A from right to left
6) [s5→s6] agent_1: move disk B from right to middle
7) [s6→s7] agent_1: move disk A from left to middle
8) [s7→s8] agent_1: move disk D from left to right
9) [s8→s9] agent_1: move disk A from middle to right
10) [s9→s10] agent_1: move disk B from middle to left
11) [s10→s11] agent_1: move disk A from right to left
12) [s11→s12] agent_1: move disk C from middle to right
13) [s12→s13] agent_1: move disk A from left to middle
14) [s13→s14] agent_1: move disk B from left to right

Resulting configuration at s14: left has E..T, middle has A, right has B on C on D.

PROBLEM
------------------------------
Devise a cooperative plan for a 3-agent Tower of Hanoi with 20 disks labelled A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, O, P, Q, R, S, T (A is the smallest, T the largest). Agents are limited to moving specific disks: agent_1 ⇒ A, B, C, D, E, F, G; agent_2 ⇒ H, I, J, K, L, M, N; agent_3 ⇒ O, P, Q, R, S, T. Initial configuration: left peg has (top→bottom) A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, O, P, Q, R, S, T; middle peg is empty; right peg is empty. Goal configuration: left peg has (top→bottom) C, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, O, P, Q, R, S, T; middle peg has (top→bottom) A, E; right peg has (top→bottom) B, D. Provide an ordered list of primitive moves in the format 'agent_i: move disk X from peg1 to peg2', respecting the agent restrictions and the Tower of Hanoi rules.
