Here is a clear, human-readable sequence that follows the plan exactly. Assume each action takes 1.0 time unit.

1) t=0.0–1.0: Unstack blue from yellow.
- Preconditions: blue is on yellow, blue is clear, hand is empty.
- Effects: now holding blue; yellow becomes clear; blue is no longer on yellow; hand is no longer empty; blue is not clear.

2) t=1.0–2.0: Stack blue on orange.
- Preconditions: holding blue, orange is clear.
- Effects: blue is on orange; blue becomes clear; hand becomes empty; orange is no longer clear.

3) t=2.0–3.0: Pick up yellow from the table.
- Preconditions: yellow is clear, yellow is on the table, hand is empty.
- Effects: now holding yellow; yellow is no longer on the table; yellow is not clear; hand is no longer empty.

4) t=3.0–4.0: Stack yellow on red.
- Preconditions: holding yellow, red is clear.
- Effects: yellow is on red; yellow becomes clear; hand becomes empty; red is no longer clear.

Goal achieved: blue is on orange and yellow is on red.
