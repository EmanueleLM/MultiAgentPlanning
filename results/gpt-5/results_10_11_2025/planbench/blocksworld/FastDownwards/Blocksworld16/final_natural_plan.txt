Here is the human-readable sequence that follows the given plan exactly. Timestamps assume unit-time actions (Δ = 1 time unit each).

1) t=0, Δ=1 — Unstack red from yellow.
2) t=1, Δ=1 — Put down red on the table.
3) t=2, Δ=1 — Unstack yellow from orange.
4) t=3, Δ=1 — Put down yellow on the table.
5) t=4, Δ=1 — Pick up orange from the table.
6) t=5, Δ=1 — Stack orange on yellow.
7) t=6, Δ=1 — Pick up blue from the table.
8) t=7, Δ=1 — Stack blue on orange.

Goal achieved: blue is on orange, and orange is on yellow.
