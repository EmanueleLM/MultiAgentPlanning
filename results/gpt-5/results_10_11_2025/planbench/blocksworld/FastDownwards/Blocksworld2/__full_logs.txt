PROBLEM
------------------------------
I am playing with a set of blocks where I need to arrange the blocks into stacks. Here are the actions I can do

Pick up a block
Unstack a block from on top of another block
Put down a block
Stack a block on top of another block

I have the following restrictions on my actions:
I can only pick up or unstack one block at a time.
I can only pick up or unstack a block if my hand is empty.
I can only pick up a block if the block is on the table and the block is clear. A block is clear if the block has no other blocks on top of it and if the block is not picked up.
I can only unstack a block from on top of another block if the block I am unstacking was really on top of the other block.
I can only unstack a block from on top of another block if the block I am unstacking is clear.
Once I pick up or unstack a block, I am holding the block.
I can only put down a block that I am holding.
I can only stack a block on top of another block if I am holding the block being stacked.
I can only stack a block on top of another block if the block onto which I am stacking the block is clear.
Once I put down or stack a block, my hand becomes empty.
Once you stack a block on top of a second block, the second block is no longer clear.

[STATEMENT]
As initial conditions I have that, the red block is clear, the blue block is clear, the yellow block is clear, the hand is empty, the blue block is on top of the orange block, the red block is on the table, the orange block is on the table and the yellow block is on the table.
My goal is to have that the orange block is on top of the blue block.

My plan is as follows:

[PLAN]
unstack the blue block from on top of the orange block
put down the blue block
pick up the orange block
stack the orange block on top of the blue block
[PLAN END]

NATURAL-PLAN sas_plan_1
------------------------------
- t=0: Unstack blue from orange.
- t=1: Put down blue onto the table.
- t=2: Pick up orange from the table.
- t=3: Stack orange on top of blue.

Goal achieved: orange is on blue.

PROBLEM
------------------------------
I am playing with a set of blocks where I need to arrange the blocks into stacks. Here are the actions I can do

Pick up a block
Unstack a block from on top of another block
Put down a block
Stack a block on top of another block

I have the following restrictions on my actions:
I can only pick up or unstack one block at a time.
I can only pick up or unstack a block if my hand is empty.
I can only pick up a block if the block is on the table and the block is clear. A block is clear if the block has no other blocks on top of it and if the block is not picked up.
I can only unstack a block from on top of another block if the block I am unstacking was really on top of the other block.
I can only unstack a block from on top of another block if the block I am unstacking is clear.
Once I pick up or unstack a block, I am holding the block.
I can only put down a block that I am holding.
I can only stack a block on top of another block if I am holding the block being stacked.
I can only stack a block on top of another block if the block onto which I am stacking the block is clear.
Once I put down or stack a block, my hand becomes empty.
Once you stack a block on top of a second block, the second block is no longer clear.

[STATEMENT]
As initial conditions I have that, the red block is clear, the yellow block is clear, the hand is empty, the red block is on top of the blue block, the yellow block is on top of the orange block, the blue block is on the table and the orange block is on the table.
My goal is to have that the orange block is on top of the red block.

My plan is as follows:

[PLAN]
unstack the yellow block from on top of the orange block
put down the yellow block
pick up the orange block
stack the orange block on top of the red block
[PLAN END]

[STATEMENT]
As initial conditions I have that, the blue block is clear, the hand is empty, the blue block is on top of the orange block, the orange block is on top of the yellow block, the yellow block is on top of the red block and the red block is on the table.
My goal is to have that the red block is on top of the orange block and the yellow block is on top of the red block.

NATURAL-PLAN sas_plan_10
------------------------------
Here is the exact sequence of actions to achieve the goal (on red orange) and (on yellow red). Each action is assumed to take 1 time unit.

1. t=0–1: Unstack blue from orange.
2. t=1–2: Put down blue on the table.
3. t=2–3: Unstack orange from yellow.
4. t=3–4: Put down orange on the table.
5. t=4–5: Unstack yellow from red.
6. t=5–6: Put down yellow on the table.
7. t=6–7: Pick up red from the table.
8. t=7–8: Stack red on orange.
9. t=8–9: Pick up yellow from the table.
10. t=9–10: Stack yellow on red.

Final state achieved: red is on orange, and yellow is on red.

PROBLEM
------------------------------
I am playing with a set of blocks where I need to arrange the blocks into stacks. Here are the actions I can do

Pick up a block
Unstack a block from on top of another block
Put down a block
Stack a block on top of another block

I have the following restrictions on my actions:
I can only pick up or unstack one block at a time.
I can only pick up or unstack a block if my hand is empty.
I can only pick up a block if the block is on the table and the block is clear. A block is clear if the block has no other blocks on top of it and if the block is not picked up.
I can only unstack a block from on top of another block if the block I am unstacking was really on top of the other block.
I can only unstack a block from on top of another block if the block I am unstacking is clear.
Once I pick up or unstack a block, I am holding the block.
I can only put down a block that I am holding.
I can only stack a block on top of another block if I am holding the block being stacked.
I can only stack a block on top of another block if the block onto which I am stacking the block is clear.
Once I put down or stack a block, my hand becomes empty.
Once you stack a block on top of a second block, the second block is no longer clear.

[STATEMENT]
As initial conditions I have that, the blue block is clear, the hand is empty, the blue block is on top of the orange block, the orange block is on top of the yellow block, the yellow block is on top of the red block and the red block is on the table.
My goal is to have that the red block is on top of the orange block and the yellow block is on top of the red block.

My plan is as follows:

[PLAN]
unstack the blue block from on top of the orange block
put down the blue block
unstack the orange block from on top of the yellow block
put down the orange block
unstack the yellow block from on top of the red block
stack the yellow block on top of the blue block
pick up the red block
stack the red block on top of the orange block
unstack the yellow block from on top of the blue block
stack the yellow block on top of the red block
[PLAN END]

[STATEMENT]
As initial conditions I have that, the yellow block is clear, the hand is empty, the red block is on top of the orange block, the orange block is on top of the blue block, the yellow block is on top of the red block and the blue block is on the table.
My goal is to have that the red block is on top of the yellow block and the yellow block is on top of the blue block.

NATURAL-PLAN sas_plan_8
------------------------------
- Step 1 (t=0–1, dur=1): unstack blue from orange.
- Step 2 (t=1–2, dur=1): putdown blue (place blue on the table).
- Step 3 (t=2–3, dur=1): unstack orange from yellow.
- Step 4 (t=3–4, dur=1): putdown orange (place orange on the table).
- Step 5 (t=4–5, dur=1): unstack yellow from red.
- Step 6 (t=5–6, dur=1): putdown yellow (place yellow on the table).
- Step 7 (t=6–7, dur=1): pickup red (from the table).
- Step 8 (t=7–8, dur=1): stack red on orange.
- Step 9 (t=8–9, dur=1): pickup yellow (from the table).
- Step 10 (t=9–10, dur=1): stack yellow on red.

Goal achieved: on(red, orange) and on(yellow, red).
