Here is the human-readable sequence of actions following the provided plan exactly. Assume each action takes 1 time unit.

1) t=0, dur=1 — Unstack yellow from orange. (unstack yellow orange)
2) t=1, dur=1 — Put down yellow onto the table. (put-down yellow)
3) t=2, dur=1 — Unstack orange from red. (unstack orange red)
4) t=3, dur=1 — Put down orange onto the table. (put-down orange)
5) t=4, dur=1 — Pick up blue from the table. (pick-up blue)
6) t=5, dur=1 — Stack blue onto orange. (stack blue orange)
7) t=6, dur=1 — Pick up yellow from the table. (pick-up yellow)
8) t=7, dur=1 — Stack yellow onto red. (stack yellow red)

Final state satisfies the goal: blue is on orange, and yellow is on red.
