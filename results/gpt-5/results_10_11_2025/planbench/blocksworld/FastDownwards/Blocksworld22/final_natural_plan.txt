Here is the human-readable action sequence that exactly follows the provided plan. Each step is assumed to take 1 time unit.

1. t=0 → t=1 (duration 1): Unstack red from yellow (unstack red yellow). Result: holding red; yellow becomes clear; hand no longer empty.
2. t=1 → t=2 (duration 1): Put red down on the table (putdown red). Result: red is on the table and clear; hand becomes empty.
3. t=2 → t=3 (duration 1): Unstack yellow from orange (unstack yellow orange). Result: holding yellow; orange becomes clear; hand no longer empty.
4. t=3 → t=4 (duration 1): Stack yellow onto red (stack yellow red). Result: yellow is on red; hand becomes empty; red is no longer clear.
5. t=4 → t=5 (duration 1): Pick up blue from the table (pickup blue). Result: holding blue; hand no longer empty.
6. t=5 → t=6 (duration 1): Stack blue onto orange (stack blue orange). Result: blue is on orange; hand becomes empty.
