Here is the human-readable sequence of actions matching the plan. Assume each action takes 1 time unit.

1. t=0→1: Unstack yellow from red.
2. t=1→2: Put down yellow onto the table.
3. t=2→3: Unstack red from orange.
4. t=3→4: Put down red onto the table.
5. t=4→5: Unstack orange from blue.
6. t=5→6: Put down orange onto the table.
7. t=6→7: Pick up red from the table.
8. t=7→8: Stack red onto blue.
9. t=8→9: Pick up yellow from the table.
10. t=9→10: Stack yellow onto orange.

Result: red is on blue, and yellow is on orange.
