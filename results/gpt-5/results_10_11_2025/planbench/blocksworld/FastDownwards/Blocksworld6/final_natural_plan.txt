Here is the human-readable execution of the plan, following the given order exactly. Assume each action takes 1 time unit.

1. t=0 → t=1 (duration 1): Unstack blue from orange.
2. t=1 → t=2 (duration 1): Put down blue on the table.
3. t=2 → t=3 (duration 1): Pick up red from the table.
4. t=3 → t=4 (duration 1): Stack red onto blue.
5. t=4 → t=5 (duration 1): Pick up yellow from the table.
6. t=5 → t=6 (duration 1): Stack yellow onto orange.
7. t=6 → t=7 (duration 1): Unstack red from blue.
8. t=7 → t=8 (duration 1): Put down red on the table.
9. t=8 → t=9 (duration 1): Pick up blue from the table.
10. t=9 → t=10 (duration 1): Stack blue onto yellow.
11. t=10 → t=11 (duration 1): Pick up red from the table.
12. t=11 → t=12 (duration 1): Stack red onto blue.

Goal achieved: red on blue, blue on yellow, yellow on orange.
