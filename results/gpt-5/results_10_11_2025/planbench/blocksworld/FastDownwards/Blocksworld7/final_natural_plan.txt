Here is the human-readable sequence of actions that matches the given plan. Each step has a 1.0 time unit duration and starts immediately after the previous step.

1. t=0.0–1.0 (dur=1.0): Unstack the blue block from on top of the orange block. [unstack(blue, orange)]
2. t=1.0–2.0 (dur=1.0): Put down the blue block onto the table. [putdown(blue)]
3. t=2.0–3.0 (dur=1.0): Pick up the red block from the table. [pickup(red)]
4. t=3.0–4.0 (dur=1.0): Stack the red block on top of the blue block. [stack(red, blue)]
5. t=4.0–5.0 (dur=1.0): Pick up the yellow block from the table. [pickup(yellow)]
6. t=5.0–6.0 (dur=1.0): Stack the yellow block on top of the orange block. [stack(yellow, orange)]
7. t=6.0–7.0 (dur=1.0): Unstack the red block from on top of the blue block. [unstack(red, blue)]
8. t=7.0–8.0 (dur=1.0): Put down the red block onto the table. [putdown(red)]
9. t=8.0–9.0 (dur=1.0): Pick up the blue block from the table. [pickup(blue)]
10. t=9.0–10.0 (dur=1.0): Stack the blue block on top of the yellow block. [stack(blue, yellow)]
11. t=10.0–11.0 (dur=1.0): Pick up the red block from the table. [pickup(red)]
12. t=11.0–12.0 (dur=1.0): Stack the red block on top of the blue block. [stack(red, blue)]

Result: Goal achieved — on(red, blue), on(blue, yellow), on(yellow, orange).
