Here is the human-readable action sequence that follows the plan exactly and achieves the goal (on blue yellow) and (on yellow red). Each step is sequential with a duration of 1 time unit.

- t=0 (dur=1): Unstack the red block from the yellow block.
- t=1 (dur=1): Put down the red block on the table.
- t=2 (dur=1): Pick up the yellow block from the table.
- t=3 (dur=1): Stack the yellow block on top of the red block.
- t=4 (dur=1): Unstack the blue block from the orange block.
- t=5 (dur=1): Stack the blue block on top of the yellow block.

Result: yellow is on red, and blue is on yellow.
