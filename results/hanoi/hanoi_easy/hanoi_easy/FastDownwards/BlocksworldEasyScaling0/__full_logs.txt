PROBLEM
------------------------------
I am practicing the Tower of Hanoi puzzle. Here is the action I can do

Move the top disk from one peg to another peg

I must obey the following rules:
I can move only one disk at a time.
I may only move a disk that is on top of a peg.
I can never place a larger disk on top of a smaller disk.
Once a disk is moved, it keeps its relative size ordering with the others.

[STATEMENT]
There are 4 disks in total. From smallest to largest they are disk A, disk B, disk C, and disk D.
As initial conditions I have that, the middle peg holds, from top to bottom, disk A, disk B, disk C, and disk D, while the left peg and the right peg are empty.
My goal is to have that the right peg holds, from top to bottom, disk A, disk B, disk C, and disk D, and both the middle peg and the left peg are empty again.
The left peg can be used as an intermediate parking spot but must end up empty.

My plan is as follows:

NATURAL-PLAN sas_plan_8
------------------------------
Based on the provided PDDL specification and the calculated plan, the following sequence of actions is required to achieve the goal state (Blue on Red, Yellow on Orange):

| Step | Action | Details |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 1 | **Unstack Block** | Unstack the Orange block (O) from the Blue block (B). The agent is now holding the Orange block. |
| 2 | **Put Down Block** | Put the Orange block (O) down onto the table. The agent's hand is now empty. |
| 3 | **Pick Up Block** | Pick up the Yellow block (Y) from the table. The agent is now holding the Yellow block. |
| 4 | **Stack Block** | Stack the Yellow block (Y) onto the Orange block (O). |

***
**Resulting Configuration:**
The Blue block remains on the Red block, and the Yellow block is now stacked on the Orange block, satisfying the goal state.
