This is a sequence of 16 actions required to solve the Tower of Hanoi puzzle, moving four disks (A, B, C, D) from the Middle Peg (M) to the Right Peg (R), following the PDDL plan exactly.

The disks are ordered by size: A (smallest), B, C, D (largest).

| Step | Time | Action Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 1 | T+1 | Move Disk A (smallest) from on top of Disk B to the Left Peg (L). |
| 2 | T+2 | Move Disk B from on top of Disk C to the Right Peg (R). |
| 3 | T+3 | Move Disk A from the Left Peg (L) onto Disk B. |
| 4 | T+4 | Move Disk C from on top of Disk D to the Left Peg (L). |
| 5 | T+5 | Move Disk A from on top of Disk B onto Disk D. |
| 6 | T+6 | Move Disk B from the Right Peg (R) onto Disk C. |
| 7 | T+7 | Move Disk A from on top of Disk D onto Disk B. |
| 8 | T+8 | Move Disk D (largest) from the Middle Peg (M) to the Right Peg (R). |
| 9 | T+9 | Move Disk A from on top of Disk B to the Middle Peg (M). |
| 10 | T+10 | Move Disk A from the Middle Peg (M) onto Disk D. |
| 11 | T+11 | Move Disk B from on top of Disk C to the Middle Peg (M). |
| 12 | T+12 | Move Disk A from on top of Disk D onto Disk B. |
| 13 | T+13 | Move Disk C from the Left Peg (L) onto Disk D. |
| 14 | T+14 | Move Disk A from on top of Disk B to the Left Peg (L). |
| 15 | T+15 | Move Disk B from the Middle Peg (M) onto Disk C. |
| 16 | T+16 | Move Disk A from the Left Peg (L) onto Disk B. |

**Goal State Achieved:** All four disks (A, B, C, D) are stacked sequentially on the Right Peg (R).
