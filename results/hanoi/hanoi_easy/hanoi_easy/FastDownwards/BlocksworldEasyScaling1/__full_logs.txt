PROBLEM
------------------------------
I am practicing the Tower of Hanoi puzzle. Here is the action I can do

Move the top disk from one peg to another peg

I must obey the following rules:
I can move only one disk at a time.
I may only move a disk that is on top of a peg.
I can never place a larger disk on top of a smaller disk.
Once a disk is moved, it keeps its relative size ordering with the others.

[STATEMENT]
There are 4 disks in total. From smallest to largest they are disk A, disk B, disk C, and disk D.
As initial conditions I have that, the middle peg holds, from top to bottom, disk A, disk B, disk C, and disk D, while the left peg and the right peg are empty.
My goal is to have that the right peg holds, from top to bottom, disk A, disk B, disk C, and disk D, and both the middle peg and the left peg are empty again.
The left peg can be used as an intermediate parking spot but must end up empty.

My plan is as follows:

NATURAL-PLAN sas_plan_6
------------------------------
This is a sequence of 16 actions required to solve the Tower of Hanoi puzzle, moving four disks (A, B, C, D) from the Middle Peg (M) to the Right Peg (R), following the PDDL plan exactly.

The disks are ordered by size: A (smallest), B, C, D (largest).

| Step | Time | Action Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 1 | T+1 | Move Disk A (smallest) from on top of Disk B to the Left Peg (L). |
| 2 | T+2 | Move Disk B from on top of Disk C to the Right Peg (R). |
| 3 | T+3 | Move Disk A from the Left Peg (L) onto Disk B. |
| 4 | T+4 | Move Disk C from on top of Disk D to the Left Peg (L). |
| 5 | T+5 | Move Disk A from on top of Disk B onto Disk D. |
| 6 | T+6 | Move Disk B from the Right Peg (R) onto Disk C. |
| 7 | T+7 | Move Disk A from on top of Disk D onto Disk B. |
| 8 | T+8 | Move Disk D (largest) from the Middle Peg (M) to the Right Peg (R). |
| 9 | T+9 | Move Disk A from on top of Disk B to the Middle Peg (M). |
| 10 | T+10 | Move Disk A from the Middle Peg (M) onto Disk D. |
| 11 | T+11 | Move Disk B from on top of Disk C to the Middle Peg (M). |
| 12 | T+12 | Move Disk A from on top of Disk D onto Disk B. |
| 13 | T+13 | Move Disk C from the Left Peg (L) onto Disk D. |
| 14 | T+14 | Move Disk A from on top of Disk B to the Left Peg (L). |
| 15 | T+15 | Move Disk B from the Middle Peg (M) onto Disk C. |
| 16 | T+16 | Move Disk A from the Left Peg (L) onto Disk B. |

**Goal State Achieved:** All four disks (A, B, C, D) are stacked sequentially on the Right Peg (R).

PROBLEM
------------------------------
I am practicing the Tower of Hanoi puzzle. Here is the action I can do

Move the top disk from one peg to another peg

I must obey the following rules:
I can move only one disk at a time.
I may only move a disk that is on top of a peg.
I can never place a larger disk on top of a smaller disk.
Once a disk is moved, it keeps its relative size ordering with the others.

[STATEMENT]
There are 4 disks in total. From smallest to largest they are disk A, disk B, disk C, and disk D.
As initial conditions I have that, the right peg holds, from top to bottom, disk A, disk B, disk C, and disk D, while the middle peg and the left peg are empty.
My goal is to have that the left peg holds, from top to bottom, disk A, disk B, disk C, and disk D, and both the right peg and the middle peg are empty again.
The middle peg can be used as an intermediate parking spot but must end up empty.

My plan is as follows:

NATURAL-PLAN sas_plan_3
------------------------------
This sequence of instructions outlines the exact movements required to transfer all four disks (A, B, C, D) from the Right peg to the Left peg, following the rules of the Tower of Hanoi puzzle.

**Initial State:** All disks are stacked on the Right peg (R), D on the bottom, A on the top.

| Step | Action | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 1 | `(move-disk-from-disk-to-peg a b m)` | Move Disk A (smallest) to the Middle peg. |
| 2 | `(move-disk-from-disk-to-peg b c l)` | Move Disk B to the Left peg. |
| 3 | `(move-disk-from-peg-to-disk a m b)` | Move Disk A from the Middle peg onto Disk B (on Left). |
| 4 | `(move-disk-from-disk-to-peg c d m)` | Move Disk C to the Middle peg. |
| 5 | `(move-disk-from-disk-to-disk a b d)` | Move Disk A (from Disk B) onto Disk D (on Right). |
| 6 | `(move-disk-from-peg-to-disk b l c)` | Move Disk B from the Left peg onto Disk C (on Middle). |
| 7 | `(move-disk-from-disk-to-disk a d b)` | Move Disk A (from Disk D) onto Disk B (on Middle). |
| 8 | `(move-disk-from-peg-to-peg d r l)` | Move Disk D (largest) from the Right peg to the Left peg. |
| 9 | `(move-disk-from-disk-to-peg a b r)` | Move Disk A (from Disk B) to the Right peg. |
| 10 | `(move-disk-from-peg-to-disk a r d)` | Move Disk A from the Right peg onto Disk D (on Left). |
| 11 | `(move-disk-from-disk-to-peg b c r)` | Move Disk B (from Disk C) to the Right peg. |
| 12 | `(move-disk-from-disk-to-disk a d b)` | Move Disk A (from Disk D) onto Disk B (on Right). |
| 13 | `(move-disk-from-peg-to-disk c m d)` | Move Disk C from the Middle peg onto Disk D (on Left). |
| 14 | `(move-disk-from-disk-to-peg a b m)` | Move Disk A (from Disk B) to the Middle peg. |
| 15 | `(move-disk-from-peg-to-disk b r c)` | Move Disk B from the Right peg onto Disk C (on Left). |
| 16 | `(move-disk-from-peg-to-disk a m b)` | Move Disk A from the Middle peg onto Disk B (on Left). |

**Final State:** All disks (A, B, C, D) are stacked in order on the Left peg.
