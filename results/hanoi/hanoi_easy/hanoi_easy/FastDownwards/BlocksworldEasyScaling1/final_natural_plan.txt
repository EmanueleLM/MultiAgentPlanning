This sequence of instructions outlines the exact movements required to transfer all four disks (A, B, C, D) from the Right peg to the Left peg, following the rules of the Tower of Hanoi puzzle.

**Initial State:** All disks are stacked on the Right peg (R), D on the bottom, A on the top.

| Step | Action | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 1 | `(move-disk-from-disk-to-peg a b m)` | Move Disk A (smallest) to the Middle peg. |
| 2 | `(move-disk-from-disk-to-peg b c l)` | Move Disk B to the Left peg. |
| 3 | `(move-disk-from-peg-to-disk a m b)` | Move Disk A from the Middle peg onto Disk B (on Left). |
| 4 | `(move-disk-from-disk-to-peg c d m)` | Move Disk C to the Middle peg. |
| 5 | `(move-disk-from-disk-to-disk a b d)` | Move Disk A (from Disk B) onto Disk D (on Right). |
| 6 | `(move-disk-from-peg-to-disk b l c)` | Move Disk B from the Left peg onto Disk C (on Middle). |
| 7 | `(move-disk-from-disk-to-disk a d b)` | Move Disk A (from Disk D) onto Disk B (on Middle). |
| 8 | `(move-disk-from-peg-to-peg d r l)` | Move Disk D (largest) from the Right peg to the Left peg. |
| 9 | `(move-disk-from-disk-to-peg a b r)` | Move Disk A (from Disk B) to the Right peg. |
| 10 | `(move-disk-from-peg-to-disk a r d)` | Move Disk A from the Right peg onto Disk D (on Left). |
| 11 | `(move-disk-from-disk-to-peg b c r)` | Move Disk B (from Disk C) to the Right peg. |
| 12 | `(move-disk-from-disk-to-disk a d b)` | Move Disk A (from Disk D) onto Disk B (on Right). |
| 13 | `(move-disk-from-peg-to-disk c m d)` | Move Disk C from the Middle peg onto Disk D (on Left). |
| 14 | `(move-disk-from-disk-to-peg a b m)` | Move Disk A (from Disk B) to the Middle peg. |
| 15 | `(move-disk-from-peg-to-disk b r c)` | Move Disk B from the Right peg onto Disk C (on Left). |
| 16 | `(move-disk-from-peg-to-disk a m b)` | Move Disk A from the Middle peg onto Disk B (on Left). |

**Final State:** All disks (A, B, C, D) are stacked in order on the Left peg.
