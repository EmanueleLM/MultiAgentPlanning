This sequence translates the provided 17-step PDDL plan into clear, human-readable instructions for moving disks in the Tower of Hanoi puzzle. Each step represents one valid disk movement.

The goal is to move all four disks (A, B, C, D) from the Middle peg (M) to the Right peg (R).

| Step | Disk | Source Peg | Destination Peg | Action |
| :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :--- |
| 1 | A | Middle (M) | Left (L) | Move Disk A from M to L. |
| 2 | B | Middle (M) | Right (R) | Move Disk B from M to R. |
| 3 | A | Left (L) | Middle (M) | Move Disk A from L to M. |
| 4 | C | Middle (M) | Left (L) | Move Disk C from M to L. |
| 5 | A | Left (L) | Middle (M) | Move Disk A from L to M. |
| 6 | A | Left (L) | Middle (M) | Move Disk A from L to M. |
| 7 | B | Right (R) | Left (L) | Move Disk B from R to L. |
| 8 | A | Left (L) | Middle (M) | Move Disk A from L to M. |
| 9 | D | Middle (M) | Right (R) | Move Disk D from M to R. |
| 10 | A | Left (L) | Middle (M) | Move Disk A from L to M. |
| 11 | B | Left (L) | Middle (M) | Move Disk B from L to M. |
| 12 | A | Left (L) | Middle (M) | Move Disk A from L to M. |
| 13 | C | Left (L) | Middle (M) | Move Disk C from L to M. |
| 14 | A | Left (L) | Middle (M) | Move Disk A from L to M. |
| 15 | A | Middle (M) | Left (L) | Move Disk A from M to L. |
| 16 | B | Middle (M) | Left (L) | Move Disk B from M to L. |
