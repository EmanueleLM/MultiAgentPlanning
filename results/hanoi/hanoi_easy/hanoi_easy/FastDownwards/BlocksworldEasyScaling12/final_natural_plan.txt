This sequence of instructions outlines the steps required to solve the 4-disk Tower of Hanoi puzzle, moving all disks from the Right Peg (R) to the Left Peg (L), adhering to the constraints that no larger disk may be placed on a smaller one.

**Initial State:** All four disks (D, C, B, A) are stacked on the Right Peg (R), with Disk D at the bottom and Disk A at the top. The Left Peg (L) and Middle Peg (M) are empty.

| Step | Action | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 1 | `(move-to-peg a b m)` | Move Disk A (smallest) from the disk B it is resting on, to the Middle Peg (M). |
| 2 | `(move-to-peg b c l)` | Move Disk B from the disk C it is resting on, to the Left Peg (L). |
| 3 | `(move-to-disk a m b)` | Move Disk A from the Middle Peg (M) onto Disk B (on L). |
| 4 | `(move-to-peg c d m)` | Move Disk C from the disk D it is resting on, to the Middle Peg (M). |
| 5 | `(move-to-disk a b d)` | Move Disk A from the disk B it is resting on, onto Disk D (on R). |
| 6 | `(move-to-disk b l c)` | Move Disk B from the Left Peg (L) onto Disk C (on M). |
| 7 | `(move-to-disk a d b)` | Move Disk A from the disk D it is resting on, onto Disk B (on C, on M). |
| 8 | `(move-to-peg d r l)` | Move Disk D (largest) from the Right Peg (R) to the Left Peg (L). (This establishes the base disk on the goal peg.) |
| 9 | `(move-to-peg a b r)` | Move Disk A from the disk B it is resting on, to the Right Peg (R). |
| 10 | `(move-to-disk a r d)` | Move Disk A from the Right Peg (R) onto Disk D (on L). |
| 11 | `(move-to-peg b c r)` | Move Disk B from the disk C it is resting on, to the Right Peg (R). |
| 12 | `(move-to-disk a d b)` | Move Disk A from the disk D it is resting on, onto Disk B (on R). |
| 13 | `(move-to-disk c m d)` | Move Disk C from the Middle Peg (M) onto Disk D (on L). |
| 14 | `(move-to-peg a b m)` | Move Disk A from the disk B it is resting on, to the Middle Peg (M). |
| 15 | `(move-to-disk b r c)` | Move Disk B from the Right Peg (R) onto Disk C (on D, on L). |
| 16 | `(move-to-disk a m b)` | Move Disk A from the Middle Peg (M) onto Disk B (on C, on D, on L). |

**Final State:** All four disks (D, C, B, A) are stacked on the Left Peg (L), completing the transfer.
