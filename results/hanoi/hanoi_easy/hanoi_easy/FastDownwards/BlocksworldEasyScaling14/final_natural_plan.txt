This is a sequence of 16 actions required to move the 4-disk Tower of Hanoi stack from the Middle peg (M) to the Left peg (L), following the minimum moves rule.

The disks are A (smallest) through D (largest). Pegs are Left (L), Middle (M), and Right (R).

| Step | Action | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 1 | `(move-d-to-p a b r)` | Move Disk A (smallest) from its current position (on Disk B, M) to the Right Peg (R). |
| 2 | `(move-d-to-p b c l)` | Move Disk B from its current position (on Disk C, M) to the Left Peg (L). |
| 3 | `(move-p-to-d a r b)` | Move Disk A from the Right Peg (R) onto Disk B (on L). |
| 4 | `(move-d-to-p c d r)` | Move Disk C from its current position (on Disk D, M) to the Right Peg (R). |
| 5 | `(move-d-to-d a b d)` | Move Disk A from Disk B (on L) onto Disk D (on M). |
| 6 | `(move-p-to-d b l c)` | Move Disk B from the Left Peg (L) onto Disk C (on R). |
| 7 | `(move-d-to-d a d b)` | Move Disk A from Disk D (on M) onto Disk B (on R). |
| 8 | `(move-p-to-p d m l)` | Move Disk D (largest) from the Middle Peg (M) to the Left Peg (L). |
| 9 | `(move-d-to-p a b m)` | Move Disk A from Disk B (on R) to the Middle Peg (M). |
| 10 | `(move-p-to-d a m d)` | Move Disk A from the Middle Peg (M) onto Disk D (on L). |
| 11 | `(move-d-to-p b c m)` | Move Disk B from Disk C (on R) to the Middle Peg (M). |
| 12 | `(move-d-to-d a d b)` | Move Disk A from Disk D (on L) onto Disk B (on M). |
| 13 | `(move-p-to-d c r d)` | Move Disk C from the Right Peg (R) onto Disk D (on L). |
| 14 | `(move-d-to-p a b r)` | Move Disk A from Disk B (on M) to the Right Peg (R). |
| 15 | `(move-p-to-d b m c)` | Move Disk B from the Middle Peg (M) onto Disk C (on L). |
| 16 | `(move-p-to-d a r b)` | Move Disk A from the Right Peg (R) onto Disk B (on L). |

**Goal State Achieved:** All disks (A, B, C, D) are stacked in order on the Left Peg (L). (Total cost: 16 moves)
