This sequence of actions translates the PDDL plan into step-by-step instructions for solving the 4-disk Tower of Hanoi puzzle, moving the entire stack from the Left peg to the Right peg.

**Initial State Summary:**
*   **Left Peg (L):** D (bottom), C, B, A (top)
*   **Middle Peg (M):** Empty
*   **Right Peg (R):** Empty

**Instructions (16 Steps):**

1.  Move Disk A (smallest) from Disk B to Peg Middle.
2.  Move Disk B from Disk C to Peg Right.
3.  Move Disk A (smallest) from Peg Middle to Disk B.
4.  Move Disk C from Disk D to Peg Middle.
5.  Move Disk A (smallest) from Disk B to Disk D.
6.  Move Disk B from Peg Right to Disk C.
7.  Move Disk A (smallest) from Disk D to Disk B.
8.  Move Disk D (largest) from Peg Left to Peg Right.
9.  Move Disk A (smallest) from Disk B to Peg Left.
10. Move Disk A (smallest) from Peg Left to Disk D.
11. Move Disk B from Disk C to Peg Left.
12. Move Disk A (smallest) from Disk D to Disk B.
13. Move Disk C from Peg Middle to Disk D.
14. Move Disk A (smallest) from Disk B to Peg Middle.
15. Move Disk B from Peg Left to Disk C.
16. Move Disk A (smallest) from Peg Middle to Disk B.

*(The goal state is now achieved: The stack D, C, B, A is located on the Right peg.)*
