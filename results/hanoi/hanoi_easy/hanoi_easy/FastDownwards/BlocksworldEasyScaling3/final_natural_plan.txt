This is the sequence of 16 actions required to solve the 4-disk Tower of Hanoi puzzle, moving all disks from the Left peg to the Right peg.

Disks are labeled A (smallest) through D (largest).
The source peg is Left (L), the auxiliary peg is Middle (M), and the target peg is Right (R).

| Step | PDDL Action | Natural Language Instruction |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 1 | `(move-d-d-p a b m)` | Move Disk A (smallest) from the Left peg onto the Middle peg. |
| 2 | `(move-d-d-p b c r)` | Move Disk B from the Left peg onto the Right peg. |
| 3 | `(move-d-p-d a b m)` | Move Disk A from the Middle peg onto Disk B (on the Right peg). |
| 4 | `(move-d-d-p c d m)` | Move Disk C from the Left peg onto the Middle peg. |
| 5 | `(move-d-d-d a b d)` | Move Disk A (on B) onto Disk D (on the Left peg). |
| 6 | `(move-d-p-d b c r)` | Move Disk B from the Right peg onto Disk C (on the Middle peg). |
| 7 | `(move-d-d-d a d b)` | Move Disk A (on D) onto Disk B (on the Middle peg). |
| 8 | `(move-d-p-p d l r)` | Move Disk D (largest) from the Left peg onto the Right peg. |
| 9 | `(move-d-d-p a b l)` | Move Disk A (on B) from the Middle peg onto the Left peg. |
| 10 | `(move-d-p-d a d l)` | Move Disk A from the Left peg onto Disk D (on the Right peg). |
| 11 | `(move-d-d-p b c l)` | Move Disk B (on C) from the Middle peg onto the Left peg. |
| 12 | `(move-d-d-d a d b)` | Move Disk A (on D) from the Right peg onto Disk B (on the Left peg). |
| 13 | `(move-d-p-d c d m)` | Move Disk C from the Middle peg onto Disk D (on the Right peg). |
| 14 | `(move-d-d-p a b m)` | Move Disk A (on B) from the Left peg onto the Middle peg. |
| 15 | `(move-d-p-d b c l)` | Move Disk B from the Left peg onto Disk C (on the Right peg). |
| 16 | `(move-d-p-d a b m)` | Move Disk A from the Middle peg onto Disk B (on the Right peg). |

The puzzle is solved. All disks are stacked correctly on the Right peg.
