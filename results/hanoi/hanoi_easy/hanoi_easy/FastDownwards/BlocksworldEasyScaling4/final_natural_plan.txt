This is the sequence of 16 moves required to solve the 4-disk Tower of Hanoi puzzle, moving the entire stack from the Left peg (L) to the Middle peg (M). Disks are labeled A (smallest) through D (largest).

| Step | Time | Action Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 1 | T=1 | Move Disk A (smallest) from its current position (on Disk B) to Peg R (Right). |
| 2 | T=2 | Move Disk B from its current position (on Disk C) to Peg M (Middle). |
| 3 | T=3 | Move Disk A from Peg R onto Disk B. |
| 4 | T=4 | Move Disk C from its current position (on Disk D) to Peg R (Right). |
| 5 | T=5 | Move Disk A from Disk B onto Disk D. |
| 6 | T=6 | Move Disk B from Peg M onto Disk C. |
| 7 | T=7 | Move Disk A from Disk D onto Disk B. |
| 8 | T=8 | Move Disk D (largest) from Peg L (Left) to Peg M (Middle). |
| 9 | T=9 | Move Disk A from Disk B to Peg L (Left). |
| 10 | T=10 | Move Disk A from Peg L onto Disk D. |
| 11 | T=11 | Move Disk B from Disk C to Peg L (Left). |
| 12 | T=12 | Move Disk A from Disk D onto Disk B. |
| 13 | T=13 | Move Disk C from Peg R onto Disk D. |
| 14 | T=14 | Move Disk A from Disk B to Peg R (Right). |
| 15 | T=15 | Move Disk B from Peg L onto Disk C. |
| 16 | T=16 | Move Disk A from Peg R onto Disk B. |

**Final State:** All four disks (A, B, C, D) are stacked sequentially on Peg M. (Total Cost: 16 moves).
