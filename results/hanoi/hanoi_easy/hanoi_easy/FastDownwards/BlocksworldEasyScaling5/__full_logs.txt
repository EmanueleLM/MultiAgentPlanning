PROBLEM
------------------------------
I am practicing the Tower of Hanoi puzzle. Here is the action I can do

Move the top disk from one peg to another peg

I must obey the following rules:
I can move only one disk at a time.
I may only move a disk that is on top of a peg.
I can never place a larger disk on top of a smaller disk.
Once a disk is moved, it keeps its relative size ordering with the others.

[STATEMENT]
There are 4 disks in total. From smallest to largest they are disk A, disk B, disk C, and disk D.
As initial conditions I have that, the middle peg holds, from top to bottom, disk A, disk B, disk C, and disk D, while the left peg and the right peg are empty.
My goal is to have that the right peg holds, from top to bottom, disk A, disk B, disk C, and disk D, and both the middle peg and the left peg are empty again.
The left peg can be used as an intermediate parking spot but must end up empty.

My plan is as follows:

NATURAL-PLAN sas_plan_6
------------------------------
This is a sequence of 16 actions required to solve the Tower of Hanoi puzzle, moving four disks (A, B, C, D) from the Middle Peg (M) to the Right Peg (R), following the PDDL plan exactly.

The disks are ordered by size: A (smallest), B, C, D (largest).

| Step | Time | Action Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 1 | T+1 | Move Disk A (smallest) from on top of Disk B to the Left Peg (L). |
| 2 | T+2 | Move Disk B from on top of Disk C to the Right Peg (R). |
| 3 | T+3 | Move Disk A from the Left Peg (L) onto Disk B. |
| 4 | T+4 | Move Disk C from on top of Disk D to the Left Peg (L). |
| 5 | T+5 | Move Disk A from on top of Disk B onto Disk D. |
| 6 | T+6 | Move Disk B from the Right Peg (R) onto Disk C. |
| 7 | T+7 | Move Disk A from on top of Disk D onto Disk B. |
| 8 | T+8 | Move Disk D (largest) from the Middle Peg (M) to the Right Peg (R). |
| 9 | T+9 | Move Disk A from on top of Disk B to the Middle Peg (M). |
| 10 | T+10 | Move Disk A from the Middle Peg (M) onto Disk D. |
| 11 | T+11 | Move Disk B from on top of Disk C to the Middle Peg (M). |
| 12 | T+12 | Move Disk A from on top of Disk D onto Disk B. |
| 13 | T+13 | Move Disk C from the Left Peg (L) onto Disk D. |
| 14 | T+14 | Move Disk A from on top of Disk B to the Left Peg (L). |
| 15 | T+15 | Move Disk B from the Middle Peg (M) onto Disk C. |
| 16 | T+16 | Move Disk A from the Left Peg (L) onto Disk B. |

**Goal State Achieved:** All four disks (A, B, C, D) are stacked sequentially on the Right Peg (R).

PROBLEM
------------------------------
I am practicing the Tower of Hanoi puzzle. Here is the action I can do

Move the top disk from one peg to another peg

I must obey the following rules:
I can move only one disk at a time.
I may only move a disk that is on top of a peg.
I can never place a larger disk on top of a smaller disk.
Once a disk is moved, it keeps its relative size ordering with the others.

[STATEMENT]
There are 4 disks in total. From smallest to largest they are disk A, disk B, disk C, and disk D.
As initial conditions I have that, the right peg holds, from top to bottom, disk A, disk B, disk C, and disk D, while the middle peg and the left peg are empty.
My goal is to have that the left peg holds, from top to bottom, disk A, disk B, disk C, and disk D, and both the right peg and the middle peg are empty again.
The middle peg can be used as an intermediate parking spot but must end up empty.

My plan is as follows:

This sequence of instructions outlines the exact movements required to transfer all four disks (A, B, C, D) from the Right peg to the Left peg, following the rules of the Tower of Hanoi puzzle.

**Initial State:** All disks are stacked on the Right peg (R), D on the bottom, A on the top.

| Step | Action | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 1 | `(move-disk-from-disk-to-peg a b m)` | Move Disk A (smallest) to the Middle peg. |
| 2 | `(move-disk-from-disk-to-peg b c l)` | Move Disk B to the Left peg. |
| 3 | `(move-disk-from-peg-to-disk a m b)` | Move Disk A from the Middle peg onto Disk B (on Left). |
| 4 | `(move-disk-from-disk-to-peg c d m)` | Move Disk C to the Middle peg. |
| 5 | `(move-disk-from-disk-to-disk a b d)` | Move Disk A (from Disk B) onto Disk D (on Right). |
| 6 | `(move-disk-from-peg-to-disk b l c)` | Move Disk B from the Left peg onto Disk C (on Middle). |
| 7 | `(move-disk-from-disk-to-disk a d b)` | Move Disk A (from Disk D) onto Disk B (on Middle). |
| 8 | `(move-disk-from-peg-to-peg d r l)` | Move Disk D (largest) from the Right peg to the Left peg. |
| 9 | `(move-disk-from-disk-to-peg a b r)` | Move Disk A (from Disk B) to the Right peg. |
| 10 | `(move-disk-from-peg-to-disk a r d)` | Move Disk A from the Right peg onto Disk D (on Left). |
| 11 | `(move-disk-from-disk-to-peg b c r)` | Move Disk B (from Disk C) to the Right peg. |
| 12 | `(move-disk-from-disk-to-disk a d b)` | Move Disk A (from Disk D) onto Disk B (on Right). |
| 13 | `(move-disk-from-peg-to-disk c m d)` | Move Disk C from the Middle peg onto Disk D (on Left). |
| 14 | `(move-disk-from-disk-to-peg a b m)` | Move Disk A (from Disk B) to the Middle peg. |
| 15 | `(move-disk-from-peg-to-disk b r c)` | Move Disk B from the Right peg onto Disk C (on Left). |
| 16 | `(move-disk-from-peg-to-disk a m b)` | Move Disk A from the Middle peg onto Disk B (on Left). |

**Final State:** All disks (A, B, C, D) are stacked in order on the Left peg.

PROBLEM
------------------------------
I am practicing the Tower of Hanoi puzzle. Here is the action I can do

Move the top disk from one peg to another peg

I must obey the following rules:
I can move only one disk at a time.
I may only move a disk that is on top of a peg.
I can never place a larger disk on top of a smaller disk.
Once a disk is moved, it keeps its relative size ordering with the others.

[STATEMENT]
There are 4 disks in total. From smallest to largest they are disk A, disk B, disk C, and disk D.
As initial conditions I have that, the left peg holds, from top to bottom, disk A, disk B, disk C, and disk D, while the middle peg and the right peg are empty.
My goal is to have that the right peg holds, from top to bottom, disk A, disk B, disk C, and disk D, and both the left peg and the middle peg are empty again.
The middle peg can be used as an intermediate parking spot but must end up empty.

My plan is as follows:

NATURAL-PLAN sas_plan_7
------------------------------
This sequence of actions translates the PDDL plan into step-by-step instructions for solving the 4-disk Tower of Hanoi puzzle, moving the entire stack from the Left peg to the Right peg.

**Initial State Summary:**
*   **Left Peg (L):** D (bottom), C, B, A (top)
*   **Middle Peg (M):** Empty
*   **Right Peg (R):** Empty

**Instructions (16 Steps):**

1.  Move Disk A (smallest) from Disk B to Peg Middle.
2.  Move Disk B from Disk C to Peg Right.
3.  Move Disk A (smallest) from Peg Middle to Disk B.
4.  Move Disk C from Disk D to Peg Middle.
5.  Move Disk A (smallest) from Disk B to Disk D.
6.  Move Disk B from Peg Right to Disk C.
7.  Move Disk A (smallest) from Disk D to Disk B.
8.  Move Disk D (largest) from Peg Left to Peg Right.
9.  Move Disk A (smallest) from Disk B to Peg Left.
10. Move Disk A (smallest) from Peg Left to Disk D.
11. Move Disk B from Disk C to Peg Left.
12. Move Disk A (smallest) from Disk D to Disk B.
13. Move Disk C from Peg Middle to Disk D.
14. Move Disk A (smallest) from Disk B to Peg Middle.
15. Move Disk B from Peg Left to Disk C.
16. Move Disk A (smallest) from Peg Middle to Disk B.

*(The goal state is now achieved: The stack D, C, B, A is located on the Right peg.)*

PROBLEM
------------------------------
I am practicing the Tower of Hanoi puzzle. Here is the action I can do

Move the top disk from one peg to another peg

I must obey the following rules:
I can move only one disk at a time.
I may only move a disk that is on top of a peg.
I can never place a larger disk on top of a smaller disk.
Once a disk is moved, it keeps its relative size ordering with the others.

[STATEMENT]
There are 4 disks in total. From smallest to largest they are disk A, disk B, disk C, and disk D.
As initial conditions I have that, the left peg holds, from top to bottom, disk A, disk B, disk C, and disk D, while the middle peg and the right peg are empty.
My goal is to have that the right peg holds, from top to bottom, disk A, disk B, disk C, and disk D, and both the left peg and the middle peg are empty again.
The middle peg can be used as an intermediate parking spot but must end up empty.

My plan is as follows:

This is the sequence of 16 actions required to solve the 4-disk Tower of Hanoi puzzle, moving all disks from the Left peg to the Right peg.

Disks are labeled A (smallest) through D (largest).
The source peg is Left (L), the auxiliary peg is Middle (M), and the target peg is Right (R).

| Step | PDDL Action | Natural Language Instruction |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 1 | `(move-d-d-p a b m)` | Move Disk A (smallest) from the Left peg onto the Middle peg. |
| 2 | `(move-d-d-p b c r)` | Move Disk B from the Left peg onto the Right peg. |
| 3 | `(move-d-p-d a b m)` | Move Disk A from the Middle peg onto Disk B (on the Right peg). |
| 4 | `(move-d-d-p c d m)` | Move Disk C from the Left peg onto the Middle peg. |
| 5 | `(move-d-d-d a b d)` | Move Disk A (on B) onto Disk D (on the Left peg). |
| 6 | `(move-d-p-d b c r)` | Move Disk B from the Right peg onto Disk C (on the Middle peg). |
| 7 | `(move-d-d-d a d b)` | Move Disk A (on D) onto Disk B (on the Middle peg). |
| 8 | `(move-d-p-p d l r)` | Move Disk D (largest) from the Left peg onto the Right peg. |
| 9 | `(move-d-d-p a b l)` | Move Disk A (on B) from the Middle peg onto the Left peg. |
| 10 | `(move-d-p-d a d l)` | Move Disk A from the Left peg onto Disk D (on the Right peg). |
| 11 | `(move-d-d-p b c l)` | Move Disk B (on C) from the Middle peg onto the Left peg. |
| 12 | `(move-d-d-d a d b)` | Move Disk A (on D) from the Right peg onto Disk B (on the Left peg). |
| 13 | `(move-d-p-d c d m)` | Move Disk C from the Middle peg onto Disk D (on the Right peg). |
| 14 | `(move-d-d-p a b m)` | Move Disk A (on B) from the Left peg onto the Middle peg. |
| 15 | `(move-d-p-d b c l)` | Move Disk B from the Left peg onto Disk C (on the Right peg). |
| 16 | `(move-d-p-d a b m)` | Move Disk A from the Middle peg onto Disk B (on the Right peg). |

The puzzle is solved. All disks are stacked correctly on the Right peg.

PROBLEM
------------------------------
I am practicing the Tower of Hanoi puzzle. Here is the action I can do

Move the top disk from one peg to another peg

I must obey the following rules:
I can move only one disk at a time.
I may only move a disk that is on top of a peg.
I can never place a larger disk on top of a smaller disk.
Once a disk is moved, it keeps its relative size ordering with the others.

[STATEMENT]
There are 4 disks in total. From smallest to largest they are disk A, disk B, disk C, and disk D.
As initial conditions I have that, the left peg holds, from top to bottom, disk A, disk B, disk C, and disk D, while the right peg and the middle peg are empty.
My goal is to have that the middle peg holds, from top to bottom, disk A, disk B, disk C, and disk D, and both the left peg and the right peg are empty again.
The right peg can be used as an intermediate parking spot but must end up empty.

My plan is as follows:

------------------------------
This is the sequence of 16 moves required to solve the 4-disk Tower of Hanoi puzzle, moving the entire stack from the Left peg (L) to the Middle peg (M). Disks are labeled A (smallest) through D (largest).

| Step | Time | Action Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 1 | T=1 | Move Disk A (smallest) from its current position (on Disk B) to Peg R (Right). |
| 2 | T=2 | Move Disk B from its current position (on Disk C) to Peg M (Middle). |
| 3 | T=3 | Move Disk A from Peg R onto Disk B. |
| 4 | T=4 | Move Disk C from its current position (on Disk D) to Peg R (Right). |
| 5 | T=5 | Move Disk A from Disk B onto Disk D. |
| 6 | T=6 | Move Disk B from Peg M onto Disk C. |
| 7 | T=7 | Move Disk A from Disk D onto Disk B. |
| 8 | T=8 | Move Disk D (largest) from Peg L (Left) to Peg M (Middle). |
| 9 | T=9 | Move Disk A from Disk B to Peg L (Left). |
| 10 | T=10 | Move Disk A from Peg L onto Disk D. |
| 11 | T=11 | Move Disk B from Disk C to Peg L (Left). |
| 12 | T=12 | Move Disk A from Disk D onto Disk B. |
| 13 | T=13 | Move Disk C from Peg R onto Disk D. |
| 14 | T=14 | Move Disk A from Disk B to Peg R (Right). |
| 15 | T=15 | Move Disk B from Peg L onto Disk C. |
| 16 | T=16 | Move Disk A from Peg R onto Disk B. |

**Final State:** All four disks (A, B, C, D) are stacked sequentially on Peg M. (Total Cost: 16 moves).

PROBLEM
------------------------------
I am practicing the Tower of Hanoi puzzle. Here is the action I can do

Move the top disk from one peg to another peg

I must obey the following rules:
I can move only one disk at a time.
I may only move a disk that is on top of a peg.
I can never place a larger disk on top of a smaller disk.
Once a disk is moved, it keeps its relative size ordering with the others.

[STATEMENT]
There are 4 disks in total. From smallest to largest they are disk A, disk B, disk C, and disk D.
As initial conditions I have that, the right peg holds, from top to bottom, disk A, disk B, disk C, and disk D, while the middle peg and the left peg are empty.
My goal is to have that the left peg holds, from top to bottom, disk A, disk B, disk C, and disk D, and both the right peg and the middle peg are empty again.
The middle peg can be used as an intermediate parking spot but must end up empty.

My plan is as follows:

I can move only one disk at a time.
I may only move a disk that is on top of a peg.
I can never place a larger disk on top of a smaller disk.
Once a disk is moved, it keeps its relative size ordering with the others.

[STATEMENT]
There are 4 disks in total. From smallest to largest they are disk A, disk B, disk C, and disk D.
As initial conditions I have that, the right peg holds, from top to bottom, disk A, disk B, disk C, and disk D, while the middle peg and the left peg are empty.
My goal is to have that the left peg holds, from top to bottom, disk A, disk B, disk C, and disk D, and both the right peg and the middle peg are empty again.
The middle peg can be used as an intermediate parking spot but must end up empty.

My plan is as follows:

NATURAL-PLAN sas_plan_5
------------------------------
This is the sequence of 16 actions required to solve the 4-disk Tower of Hanoi puzzle, moving the stack from the Right peg to the Left peg, following the exact PDDL plan provided.

**Initial State:** All disks (D, C, B, A) are stacked on the Right peg.
**Goal State:** All disks (D, C, B, A) are stacked on the Left peg.

| Step | Time | Action | Description |
| :---: | :---: | :--- | :--- |
| 1 | t=1 | (move-to-peg a b middle) | Move Disk A (smallest) from Disk B to the Middle Peg. |
| 2 | t=2 | (move-to-peg b c left) | Move Disk B from Disk C to the Left Peg. |
| 3 | t=3 | (move-to-disk a middle b) | Move Disk A from the Middle Peg onto Disk B. |
| 4 | t=4 | (move-to-peg c d middle) | Move Disk C from Disk D to the Middle Peg. |
| 5 | t=5 | (move-to-disk a b d) | Move Disk A from Disk B onto Disk D. |
| 6 | t=6 | (move-to-disk b left c) | Move Disk B from the Left Peg onto Disk C. |
| 7 | t=7 | (move-to-disk a d b) | Move Disk A from Disk D onto Disk B. |
| 8 | t=8 | (move-to-peg d right left) | Move Disk D (largest) from the Right Peg to the Left Peg. |
| 9 | t=9 | (move-to-peg a b right) | Move Disk A from Disk B to the Right Peg. |
| 10 | t=10 | (move-to-disk a right d) | Move Disk A from the Right Peg onto Disk D. |
| 11 | t=11 | (move-to-peg b c right) | Move Disk B from Disk C to the Right Peg. |
| 12 | t=12 | (move-to-disk a d b) | Move Disk A from Disk D onto Disk B. |
| 13 | t=13 | (move-to-disk c middle d) | Move Disk C from the Middle Peg onto Disk D. |
| 14 | t=14 | (move-to-peg a b middle) | Move Disk A from Disk B to the Middle Peg. |
| 15 | t=15 | (move-to-disk b right c) | Move Disk B from the Right Peg onto Disk C. |
| 16 | t=16 | (move-to-disk a middle b) | Move Disk A from the Middle Peg onto Disk B. |

**Final State Achieved:** The four disks (D, C, B, A) are stacked correctly on the Left peg. (Total cost = 16 moves).
