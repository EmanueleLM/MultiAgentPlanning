This is the sequence of 16 actions required to solve the 4-disk Tower of Hanoi puzzle, moving the stack from the Right peg to the Left peg, following the exact PDDL plan provided.

**Initial State:** All disks (D, C, B, A) are stacked on the Right peg.
**Goal State:** All disks (D, C, B, A) are stacked on the Left peg.

| Step | Time | Action | Description |
| :---: | :---: | :--- | :--- |
| 1 | t=1 | (move-to-peg a b middle) | Move Disk A (smallest) from Disk B to the Middle Peg. |
| 2 | t=2 | (move-to-peg b c left) | Move Disk B from Disk C to the Left Peg. |
| 3 | t=3 | (move-to-disk a middle b) | Move Disk A from the Middle Peg onto Disk B. |
| 4 | t=4 | (move-to-peg c d middle) | Move Disk C from Disk D to the Middle Peg. |
| 5 | t=5 | (move-to-disk a b d) | Move Disk A from Disk B onto Disk D. |
| 6 | t=6 | (move-to-disk b left c) | Move Disk B from the Left Peg onto Disk C. |
| 7 | t=7 | (move-to-disk a d b) | Move Disk A from Disk D onto Disk B. |
| 8 | t=8 | (move-to-peg d right left) | Move Disk D (largest) from the Right Peg to the Left Peg. |
| 9 | t=9 | (move-to-peg a b right) | Move Disk A from Disk B to the Right Peg. |
| 10 | t=10 | (move-to-disk a right d) | Move Disk A from the Right Peg onto Disk D. |
| 11 | t=11 | (move-to-peg b c right) | Move Disk B from Disk C to the Right Peg. |
| 12 | t=12 | (move-to-disk a d b) | Move Disk A from Disk D onto Disk B. |
| 13 | t=13 | (move-to-disk c middle d) | Move Disk C from the Middle Peg onto Disk D. |
| 14 | t=14 | (move-to-peg a b middle) | Move Disk A from Disk B to the Middle Peg. |
| 15 | t=15 | (move-to-disk b right c) | Move Disk B from the Right Peg onto Disk C. |
| 16 | t=16 | (move-to-disk a middle b) | Move Disk A from the Middle Peg onto Disk B. |

**Final State Achieved:** The four disks (D, C, B, A) are stacked correctly on the Left peg. (Total cost = 16 moves).
