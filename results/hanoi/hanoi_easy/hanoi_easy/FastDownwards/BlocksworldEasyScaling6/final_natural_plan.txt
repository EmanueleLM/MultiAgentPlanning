This sequence of actions solves the 4-disk Tower of Hanoi puzzle, transferring the entire stack from the Left Peg (L) to the Right Peg (R), respecting the rule that a larger disk may never be placed on a smaller disk.

The disks are A (smallest), B, C, D (largest). Pegs are Left (L), Middle (M), and Right (R).

| Step | Action | Instruction |
| :---: | :--- | :--- |
| 1 | `(move-d-d-to-p a b m)` | Move Disk A from Disk B to the Middle Peg (M). |
| 2 | `(move-d-d-to-p b c r)` | Move Disk B from Disk C to the Right Peg (R). |
| 3 | `(move-d-p-to-d a m b)` | Move Disk A from the Middle Peg (M) onto Disk B. |
| 4 | `(move-d-d-to-p c d m)` | Move Disk C from Disk D to the Middle Peg (M). |
| 5 | `(move-d-d-to-d a b d)` | Move Disk A from Disk B onto Disk D. |
| 6 | `(move-d-p-to-d b r c)` | Move Disk B from the Right Peg (R) onto Disk C. |
| 7 | `(move-d-d-to-d a d b)` | Move Disk A from Disk D onto Disk B. |
| 8 | `(move-d-p-to-p d l r)` | Move Disk D from the Left Peg (L) to the Right Peg (R). |
| 9 | `(move-d-d-to-p a b l)` | Move Disk A from Disk B to the Left Peg (L). |
| 10 | `(move-d-p-to-d a l d)` | Move Disk A from the Left Peg (L) onto Disk D. |
| 11 | `(move-d-d-to-p b c l)` | Move Disk B from Disk C to the Left Peg (L). |
| 12 | `(move-d-d-to-d a d b)` | Move Disk A from Disk D onto Disk B. |
| 13 | `(move-d-p-to-d c m d)` | Move Disk C from the Middle Peg (M) onto Disk D. |
| 14 | `(move-d-d-to-p a b m)` | Move Disk A from Disk B to the Middle Peg (M). |
| 15 | `(move-d-p-to-d b l c)` | Move Disk B from the Left Peg (L) onto Disk C. |
| 16 | `(move-d-p-to-d a m b)` | Move Disk A from the Middle Peg (M) onto Disk B. |

**Final State:** All disks (D, C, B, A) are stacked correctly on the Right Peg (R).
