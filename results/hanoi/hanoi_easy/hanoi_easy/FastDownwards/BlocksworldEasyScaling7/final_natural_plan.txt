This set of instructions outlines the 16 necessary moves to transfer the stack of four disks (A, B, C, D) from the Middle Peg (P2) to the Right Peg (P3), following the constraints of the Tower of Hanoi puzzle.

**Initial State:** All disks (D, C, B, A) are stacked on the Middle Peg (P2).

| Step | Action Description | Move Details |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 1 | Move Disk A (smallest) | From Disk B (on Middle Peg) to the Left Peg (P1). |
| 2 | Move Disk B | From Disk C (on Middle Peg) to the Right Peg (P3). |
| 3 | Move Disk A (smallest) | From the Left Peg (P1) onto Disk B (on P3). |
| 4 | Move Disk C | From Disk D (on Middle Peg) to the Left Peg (P1). |
| 5 | Move Disk A (smallest) | From Disk B (on P3) onto Disk D (on P2). |
| 6 | Move Disk B | From the Right Peg (P3) onto Disk C (on P1). |
| 7 | Move Disk A (smallest) | From Disk D (on P2) onto Disk B (on P1). |
| 8 | Move Disk D (largest) | From the Middle Peg (P2) to the Right Peg (P3). |
| 9 | Move Disk A (smallest) | From Disk B (on P1) to the Middle Peg (P2). |
| 10 | Move Disk A (smallest) | From the Middle Peg (P2) onto Disk D (on P3). |
| 11 | Move Disk B | From Disk C (on P1) to the Middle Peg (P2). |
| 12 | Move Disk A (smallest) | From Disk D (on P3) onto Disk B (on P2). |
| 13 | Move Disk C | From the Left Peg (P1) onto Disk D (on P3). |
| 14 | Move Disk A (smallest) | From Disk B (on P2) to the Left Peg (P1). |
| 15 | Move Disk B | From the Middle Peg (P2) onto Disk C (on P3). |
| 16 | Move Disk A (smallest) | From the Left Peg (P1) onto Disk B (on P3). |

**Final State:** All disks (D, C, B, A) are successfully stacked on the Right Peg (P3).
