This sequence of instructions outlines the minimal number of moves required to transfer the stack of four disks (A, B, C, D, where A is the smallest and D is the largest) from Peg 2 (Middle) to Peg 3 (Right), strictly following the rules of the Tower of Hanoi puzzle.

### Tower of Hanoi: 4 Disks, Peg 2 to Peg 3 (16 Steps)

| Step | Action Type | Source Location | Destination Location | Instruction |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 1 | `move_from_disk_to_empty_peg` | Disk B (on Peg 2) | Peg 1 (Left) | Move Disk A (smallest) from the top of Disk B to Peg 1 (Left). |
| 2 | `move_from_disk_to_empty_peg` | Disk C (on Peg 2) | Peg 3 (Right) | Move Disk B from the top of Disk C to Peg 3 (Right). |
| 3 | `move_from_peg_to_disk` | Peg 1 (Left) | Disk B (on Peg 3) | Move Disk A from Peg 1 (Left) onto Disk B. |
| 4 | `move_from_disk_to_empty_peg` | Disk D (on Peg 2) | Peg 1 (Left) | Move Disk C from the top of Disk D to Peg 1 (Left). |
| 5 | `move_from_disk_to_disk` | Disk B (on Peg 3) | Disk D (on Peg 2) | Move Disk A from the top of Disk B onto Disk D. |
| 6 | `move_from_peg_to_disk` | Peg 3 (Right) | Disk C (on Peg 1) | Move Disk B from Peg 3 (Right) onto Disk C. |
| 7 | `move_from_disk_to_disk` | Disk D (on Peg 2) | Disk B (on Peg 1) | Move Disk A from the top of Disk D onto Disk B. |
| 8 | `move_from_peg_to_empty_peg` | Peg 2 (Middle) | Peg 3 (Right) | Move Disk D (largest, the base of the current Peg 2 stack) to Peg 3 (Right). |
| 9 | `move_from_disk_to_empty_peg` | Disk B (on Peg 1) | Peg 2 (Middle) | Move Disk A from the top of Disk B to Peg 2 (Middle). |
| 10 | `move_from_peg_to_disk` | Peg 2 (Middle) | Disk D (on Peg 3) | Move Disk A from Peg 2 (Middle) onto Disk D. |
| 11 | `move_from_disk_to_empty_peg` | Disk C (on Peg 1) | Peg 2 (Middle) | Move Disk B from the top of Disk C to Peg 2 (Middle). |
| 12 | `move_from_disk_to_disk` | Disk D (on Peg 3) | Disk B (on Peg 2) | Move Disk A from the top of Disk D onto Disk B. |
| 13 | `move_from_peg_to_disk` | Peg 1 (Left) | Disk D (on Peg 3) | Move Disk C from Peg 1 (Left) onto Disk D. |
| 14 | `move_from_disk_to_empty_peg` | Disk B (on Peg 2) | Peg 1 (Left) | Move Disk A from the top of Disk B to Peg 1 (Left). |
| 15 | `move_from_peg_to_disk` | Peg 2 (Middle) | Disk C (on Peg 3) | Move Disk B from Peg 2 (Middle) onto Disk C. |
| 16 | `move_from_peg_to_disk` | Peg 1 (Left) | Disk B (on Peg 3) | Move Disk A from Peg 1 (Left) onto Disk B. |

**Goal State Achieved:** All four disks (D, C, B, A) are stacked sequentially on Peg 3 (Right).
