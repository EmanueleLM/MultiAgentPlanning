This sequence of instructions outlines the 16 minimum moves required to transfer all four disks (A, B, C, D) from the Middle Peg (M) to the Right Peg (R), following the strict rules of the Tower of Hanoi puzzle.

**Initial State:** Peg M holds D, C, B, A (top). Pegs L and R are empty.

| Step | Action | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Step 1** | `(move-to-peg a b l)` | Move Disk A (smallest) from Disk B (on M) to the Left Peg (L). |
| **Step 2** | `(move-to-peg b c r)` | Move Disk B from Disk C (on M) to the Right Peg (R). |
| **Step 3** | `(move-to-disk a l b)` | Move Disk A from the Left Peg (L) onto Disk B (on R). |
| **Step 4** | `(move-to-peg c d l)` | Move Disk C from Disk D (on M) to the Left Peg (L). |
| **Step 5** | `(move-to-disk a b d)` | Move Disk A from Disk B (on R) onto Disk D (on M). |
| **Step 6** | `(move-to-disk b r c)` | Move Disk B from the Right Peg (R) onto Disk C (on L). |
| **Step 7** | `(move-to-disk a d b)` | Move Disk A from Disk D (on M) onto Disk B (on C/L). |
| **Step 8** | `(move-to-peg d m r)` | Move Disk D (largest) from the Middle Peg (M) to the Right Peg (R). |
| **Step 9** | `(move-to-peg a b m)` | Move Disk A from Disk B (on C/L) to the Middle Peg (M). |
| **Step 10** | `(move-to-disk a m d)` | Move Disk A from the Middle Peg (M) onto Disk D (on R). |
| **Step 11** | `(move-to-peg b c m)` | Move Disk B from Disk C (on L) to the Middle Peg (M). |
| **Step 12** | `(move-to-disk a d b)` | Move Disk A from Disk D (on R) onto Disk B (on M). |
| **Step 13** | `(move-to-disk c l d)` | Move Disk C from the Left Peg (L) onto Disk D (on R). |
| **Step 14** | `(move-to-peg a b l)` | Move Disk A from Disk B (on M) to the Left Peg (L). |
| **Step 15** | `(move-to-disk b m c)` | Move Disk B from the Middle Peg (M) onto Disk C (on D/R). |
| **Step 16** | `(move-to-disk a l b)` | Move Disk A from the Left Peg (L) onto Disk B (on C/D/R). |

**Final State:** Peg R holds D, C, B, A (top). Pegs L and M are empty. (Goal Achieved)
