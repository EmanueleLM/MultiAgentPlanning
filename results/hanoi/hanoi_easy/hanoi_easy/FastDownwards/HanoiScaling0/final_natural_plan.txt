Based on the PDDL specification and the provided plan for the 4-disk Tower of Hanoi puzzle, the following sequence of 16 actions will move the stack of disks (A, B, C, D) from the Middle peg to the Right peg.

Disks are ordered by size: A (smallest), B, C, D (largest).

| Step | Action | Description of Movement |
| :---: | :--- | :--- |
| 1 | `(move-disk-to-peg a left b)` | Move disk A from the Middle peg onto the Left peg. |
| 2 | `(move-disk-to-peg b right c)` | Move disk B from the Middle peg onto the Right peg. |
| 3 | `(move-base-to-disk a left b)` | Move disk A from the Left peg onto disk B on the Right peg. |
| 4 | `(move-disk-to-peg c left d)` | Move disk C from the Middle peg onto the Left peg. |
| 5 | `(move-disk-to-disk a b d)` | Move disk A from the Right peg (where it was on B) onto disk D on the Middle peg. |
| 6 | `(move-base-to-disk b right c)` | Move disk B from the Right peg (where it was the base) onto disk C on the Left peg. |
| 7 | `(move-disk-to-disk a d b)` | Move disk A from the Middle peg (where it was on D) onto disk B on the Left peg. |
| 8 | `(move-base-to-peg d middle right)` | Move disk D from the Middle peg to the Right peg. |
| 9 | `(move-disk-to-peg a middle b)` | Move disk A from the Left peg onto the Middle peg. |
| 10 | `(move-base-to-disk a middle d)` | Move disk A from the Middle peg (where it was the base) onto disk D on the Right peg. |
| 11 | `(move-disk-to-peg b middle c)` | Move disk B from the Left peg onto the Middle peg. |
| 12 | `(move-disk-to-disk a d b)` | Move disk A from the Right peg (where it was on D) onto disk B on the Middle peg. |
| 13 | `(move-base-to-disk c left d)` | Move disk C from the Left peg onto disk D on the Right peg. |
| 14 | `(move-disk-to-peg a left b)` | Move disk A from the Middle peg (where it was on B) onto the Left peg. |
| 15 | `(move-base-to-disk b middle c)` | Move disk B from the Middle peg onto disk C on the Right peg. |
| 16 | `(move-base-to-disk a left b)` | Move disk A from the Left peg onto disk B on the Right peg. |

The task is complete. All four disks (A, B, C, D) are now stacked correctly on the Right peg.
