PROBLEM
------------------------------
I am practicing the Tower of Hanoi puzzle. Here is the action I can do

Move the top disk from one peg to another peg

I must obey the following rules:
I can move only one disk at a time.
I may only move a disk that is on top of a peg.
I can never place a larger disk on top of a smaller disk.
Once a disk is moved, it keeps its relative size ordering with the others.

[STATEMENT]
There are 4 disks in total. From smallest to largest they are disk A, disk B, disk C, and disk D.
As initial conditions I have that, the middle peg holds, from top to bottom, disk A, disk B, disk C, and disk D, while the left peg and the right peg are empty.
My goal is to have that the right peg holds, from top to bottom, disk A, disk B, disk C, and disk D, and both the middle peg and the left peg are empty again.
The left peg can be used as an intermediate parking spot but must end up empty.

My plan is as follows:

NATURAL-PLAN sas_plan_3
------------------------------
Based on the PDDL specification and the provided plan for the 4-disk Tower of Hanoi puzzle, the following sequence of 16 actions will move the stack of disks (A, B, C, D) from the Middle peg to the Right peg.

Disks are ordered by size: A (smallest), B, C, D (largest).

| Step | Action | Description of Movement |
| :---: | :--- | :--- |
| 1 | `(move-disk-to-peg a left b)` | Move disk A from the Middle peg onto the Left peg. |
| 2 | `(move-disk-to-peg b right c)` | Move disk B from the Middle peg onto the Right peg. |
| 3 | `(move-base-to-disk a left b)` | Move disk A from the Left peg onto disk B on the Right peg. |
| 4 | `(move-disk-to-peg c left d)` | Move disk C from the Middle peg onto the Left peg. |
| 5 | `(move-disk-to-disk a b d)` | Move disk A from the Right peg (where it was on B) onto disk D on the Middle peg. |
| 6 | `(move-base-to-disk b right c)` | Move disk B from the Right peg (where it was the base) onto disk C on the Left peg. |
| 7 | `(move-disk-to-disk a d b)` | Move disk A from the Middle peg (where it was on D) onto disk B on the Left peg. |
| 8 | `(move-base-to-peg d middle right)` | Move disk D from the Middle peg to the Right peg. |
| 9 | `(move-disk-to-peg a middle b)` | Move disk A from the Left peg onto the Middle peg. |
| 10 | `(move-base-to-disk a middle d)` | Move disk A from the Middle peg (where it was the base) onto disk D on the Right peg. |
| 11 | `(move-disk-to-peg b middle c)` | Move disk B from the Left peg onto the Middle peg. |
| 12 | `(move-disk-to-disk a d b)` | Move disk A from the Right peg (where it was on D) onto disk B on the Middle peg. |
| 13 | `(move-base-to-disk c left d)` | Move disk C from the Left peg onto disk D on the Right peg. |
| 14 | `(move-disk-to-peg a left b)` | Move disk A from the Middle peg (where it was on B) onto the Left peg. |
| 15 | `(move-base-to-disk b middle c)` | Move disk B from the Middle peg onto disk C on the Right peg. |
| 16 | `(move-base-to-disk a left b)` | Move disk A from the Left peg onto disk B on the Right peg. |

The task is complete. All four disks (A, B, C, D) are now stacked correctly on the Right peg.

PROBLEM
------------------------------
I am practicing the Tower of Hanoi puzzle. Here is the action I can do

Move the top disk from one peg to another peg

I must obey the following rules:
I can move only one disk at a time.
I may only move a disk that is on top of a peg.
I can never place a larger disk on top of a smaller disk.
Once a disk is moved, it keeps its relative size ordering with the others.

[STATEMENT]
There are 4 disks in total. From smallest to largest they are disk A, disk B, disk C, and disk D.
As initial conditions I have that, the right peg holds, from top to bottom, disk A, disk B, disk C, and disk D, while the middle peg and the left peg are empty.
My goal is to have that the left peg holds, from top to bottom, disk A, disk B, disk C, and disk D, and both the right peg and the middle peg are empty again.
The middle peg can be used as an intermediate parking spot but must end up empty.

My plan is as follows:

NATURAL-PLAN sas_plan_3
------------------------------
This sequence of instructions translates the PDDL plan for solving the 4-disk Tower of Hanoi puzzle from the Right peg (R) to the Left peg (L), using the Middle peg (M) as auxiliary.

Disks are labeled A (smallest) through D (largest).

| Time | Action | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 1 | `(move-d-d--d-p a b r m)` | Move Disk A (smallest) from the Right peg to the Middle peg. |
| 2 | `(move-d-d--d-p b c r l)` | Move Disk B from the Right peg to the Left peg. |
| 3 | `(move-d-p--d-d a b m l)` | Move Disk A from the Middle peg to the Left peg, placing it on Disk B. |
| 4 | `(move-d-d--d-p c d r m)` | Move Disk C from the Right peg to the Middle peg. |
| 5 | `(move-d-d--d-d a b d l r)` | Move Disk A (on B) from the Left peg to the Right peg, placing it on Disk D. |
| 6 | `(move-d-p--d-d b c l m)` | Move Disk B (base of L) from the Left peg to the Middle peg, placing it on Disk C. |
| 7 | `(move-d-d--d-d a d b r m)` | Move Disk A (on D) from the Right peg to the Middle peg, placing it on Disk B. |
| 8 | `(move-d-p--d-p d r l)` | Move Disk D (largest) from the Right peg to the Left peg (Target Base). |
| 9 | `(move-d-d--d-d a b d m l)` | Move Disk A (on B) from the Middle peg to the Left peg, placing it on Disk D. |
| 10 | `(move-d-d--d-p b c m r)` | Move Disk B (on C) from the Middle peg to the Right peg. |
| 11 | `(move-d-d--d-d a d c l m)` | Move Disk A (on D) from the Left peg to the Middle peg, placing it on Disk C. |
| 12 | `(move-d-d--d-d a c b m r)` | Move Disk A (on C) from the Middle peg to the Right peg, placing it on Disk B. |
| 13 | `(move-d-p--d-d c d m l)` | Move Disk C (base of M) from the Middle peg to the Left peg, placing it on Disk D. |
| 14 | `(move-d-d--d-p a b r m)` | Move Disk A (on B) from the Right peg to the Middle peg. |
| 15 | `(move-d-p--d-d b c r l)` | Move Disk B (base of R) from the Right peg to the Left peg, placing it on Disk C. |
| 16 | `(move-d-p--d-d a b m l)` | Move Disk A (base of M) from the Middle peg to the Left peg, placing it on Disk B. |

**Final State:** All disks (A, B, C, D) are stacked correctly on the Left peg. (Total cost: 16 moves)
