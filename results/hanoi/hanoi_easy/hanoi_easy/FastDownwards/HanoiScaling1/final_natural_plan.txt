This sequence of instructions translates the PDDL plan for solving the 4-disk Tower of Hanoi puzzle from the Right peg (R) to the Left peg (L), using the Middle peg (M) as auxiliary.

Disks are labeled A (smallest) through D (largest).

| Time | Action | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 1 | `(move-d-d--d-p a b r m)` | Move Disk A (smallest) from the Right peg to the Middle peg. |
| 2 | `(move-d-d--d-p b c r l)` | Move Disk B from the Right peg to the Left peg. |
| 3 | `(move-d-p--d-d a b m l)` | Move Disk A from the Middle peg to the Left peg, placing it on Disk B. |
| 4 | `(move-d-d--d-p c d r m)` | Move Disk C from the Right peg to the Middle peg. |
| 5 | `(move-d-d--d-d a b d l r)` | Move Disk A (on B) from the Left peg to the Right peg, placing it on Disk D. |
| 6 | `(move-d-p--d-d b c l m)` | Move Disk B (base of L) from the Left peg to the Middle peg, placing it on Disk C. |
| 7 | `(move-d-d--d-d a d b r m)` | Move Disk A (on D) from the Right peg to the Middle peg, placing it on Disk B. |
| 8 | `(move-d-p--d-p d r l)` | Move Disk D (largest) from the Right peg to the Left peg (Target Base). |
| 9 | `(move-d-d--d-d a b d m l)` | Move Disk A (on B) from the Middle peg to the Left peg, placing it on Disk D. |
| 10 | `(move-d-d--d-p b c m r)` | Move Disk B (on C) from the Middle peg to the Right peg. |
| 11 | `(move-d-d--d-d a d c l m)` | Move Disk A (on D) from the Left peg to the Middle peg, placing it on Disk C. |
| 12 | `(move-d-d--d-d a c b m r)` | Move Disk A (on C) from the Middle peg to the Right peg, placing it on Disk B. |
| 13 | `(move-d-p--d-d c d m l)` | Move Disk C (base of M) from the Middle peg to the Left peg, placing it on Disk D. |
| 14 | `(move-d-d--d-p a b r m)` | Move Disk A (on B) from the Right peg to the Middle peg. |
| 15 | `(move-d-p--d-d b c r l)` | Move Disk B (base of R) from the Right peg to the Left peg, placing it on Disk C. |
| 16 | `(move-d-p--d-d a b m l)` | Move Disk A (base of M) from the Middle peg to the Left peg, placing it on Disk B. |

**Final State:** All disks (A, B, C, D) are stacked correctly on the Left peg. (Total cost: 16 moves)
