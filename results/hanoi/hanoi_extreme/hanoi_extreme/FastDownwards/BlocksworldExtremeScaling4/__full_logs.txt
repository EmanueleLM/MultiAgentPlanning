PROBLEM
------------------------------
I am practicing the Tower of Hanoi puzzle. Here is the action I can do

Move the top disk from one peg to another peg

I must obey the following rules:
I can move only one disk at a time.
I may only move a disk that is on top of a peg.
I can never place a larger disk on top of a smaller disk.
Once a disk is moved, it keeps its relative size ordering with the others.

[STATEMENT]
There are 7 disks in total. From smallest to largest they are disk A, disk B, disk C, disk D, disk E, disk F, and disk G.
As initial conditions I have that, the middle peg holds, from top to bottom, disk A, disk B, disk C, disk D, disk E, disk F, and disk G, while the left peg and the right peg are empty.
My goal is to have that the right peg holds, from top to bottom, disk A, disk B, disk C, disk D, disk E, disk F, and disk G, and both the middle peg and the left peg are empty again.
The left peg can be used as an intermediate parking spot but must end up empty.

I will not ask the user for further clarifications and I will report the plan that explicitly states all the (2^7 - 1) intermediate steps to achieve the objective in an optimal way. My plan is as follows:

From smallest to largest they are disk A, disk B, disk C, disk D, disk E, disk F, and disk G.\nAs initial conditions I have that, the middle peg holds, from top to bottom, disk A, disk B, disk C, disk D, disk E, disk F, and disk G, while the left peg and the right peg are empty.\nMy goal is to have that the right peg holds, from top to bottom, disk A, disk B, disk C, disk D, disk E, disk F, and disk G, and both the middle peg and the left peg are empty again.\nThe left peg can be used as an intermediate parking spot but must end up empty.\n\nI will not ask the user for further clarifications and I will report the plan that explicitly states all the (2^7 - 1) intermediate steps to achieve the objective in an optimal way.

PROBLEM
------------------------------
I am practicing the Tower of Hanoi puzzle. Here is the action I can do

Move the top disk from one peg to another peg

I must obey the following rules:
I can move only one disk at a time.
I may only move a disk that is on top of a peg.
I can never place a larger disk on top of a smaller disk.
Once a disk is moved, it keeps its relative size ordering with the others.

[STATEMENT]
There are 7 disks in total. From smallest to largest they are disk A, disk B, disk C, disk D, disk E, disk F, and disk G.
As initial conditions I have that, the right peg holds, from top to bottom, disk A, disk B, disk C, disk D, disk E, disk F, and disk G, while the middle peg and the left peg are empty.
My goal is to have that the left peg holds, from top to bottom, disk A, disk B, disk C, disk D, disk E, disk F, and disk G, and both the right peg and the middle peg are empty again.
The middle peg can be used as an intermediate parking spot but must end up empty.

I will not ask the user for further clarifications and I will report the plan that explicitly states all the (2^7 - 1) intermediate steps to achieve the objective in an optimal way. My plan is as follows:

NATURAL-PLAN sas_plan_10
------------------------------
This is a translation of the 283-step PDDL plan designed to maneuver Disks A through G (A being smallest, G largest) from the Right Peg (R) to the Left Peg (L), adhering to the Tower of Hanoi constraints.

### Execution Instructions (7-Disk Tower of Hanoi Simulation)

**Initial State:** All disks (G, F, E, D, C, B, A) are stacked on the Right Peg (R). The Left Peg (L) and Middle Peg (M) are empty.

**Note on Plan Completeness:** The original PDDL plan required an optimal 127 steps to transfer all disks from R to L. The provided plan contains 282 movement steps. Assuming the puzzle was solved correctly at step 127 (Disk A moved from M to B, which completes the transfer of the 7-disk stack to L if the goal configuration listed in the problem was met), the subsequent steps represent further movement or reconfigurations not strictly required by the goal state defined in the PDDL problem. Since the explicit instruction was to translate the provided plan sequence exactly, all 282 actions have been listed.

PROBLEM
------------------------------
I am practicing the Tower of Hanoi puzzle. Here is the action I can do

Move the top disk from one peg to another peg

I must obey the following rules:
I can move only one disk at a time.
I may only move a disk that is on top of a peg.
I can never place a larger disk on top of a smaller disk.
Once a disk is moved, it keeps its relative size ordering with the others.

[STATEMENT]
There are 7 disks in total. From smallest to largest they are disk A, disk B, disk C, disk D, disk E, disk F, and disk G.
As initial conditions I have that, the left peg holds, from top to bottom, disk A, disk B, disk C, disk D, disk E, disk F, and disk G, while the middle peg and the right peg are empty.
My goal is to have that the right peg holds, from top to bottom, disk A, disk B, disk C, disk D, disk E, disk F, and disk G, and both the left peg and the middle peg are empty again.
The middle peg can be used as an intermediate parking spot but must end up empty.

I will not ask the user for further clarifications and I will report the plan that explicitly states all the (2^7 - 1) intermediate steps to achieve the objective in an optimal way. My plan is as follows:

From smallest to largest they are disk A, disk B, disk C, disk D, disk E, disk F, and disk G.\nAs initial conditions I have that, the left peg holds, from top to bottom, disk A, disk B, disk C, disk D, disk E, disk F, and disk G, while the middle peg and the right peg are empty.\nMy goal is to have that the right peg holds, from top to bottom, disk A, disk B, disk C, disk D, disk E, disk F, and disk G, and both the left peg and the middle peg are empty again.\nThe middle peg can be used as an intermediate parking spot but must end up empty.\n\nI will not ask the user for further clarifications and I will report the plan that explicitly states all the (2^7 - 1) intermediate steps to achieve the objective in an optimal way. My plan is as follows:\n\n[PLAN]",

From smallest to largest they are disk A, disk B, disk C, disk D, disk E, disk F, and disk G.\nAs initial conditions I have that, the left peg holds, from top to bottom, disk A, disk B, disk C, disk D, disk E, disk F, and disk G, while the middle peg and the right peg are empty.\nMy goal is to have that the right peg holds, from top to bottom, disk A, disk B, disk C, disk D, disk E, disk F, and disk G, and both the left peg and the middle peg are empty again.\nThe middle peg can be used as an intermediate parking spot but must end up empty.\n\nI will not ask the user for further clarifications and I will report the plan that explicitly states all the (2^7 - 1) intermediate steps to achieve the objective in an optimal way.

Here is the action I can do\n\nMove the top disk from one peg to another peg\n\nI must obey the following rules:\nI can move only one disk at a time.\nI may only move a disk that is on top of a peg.\nI can never place a larger disk on top of a smaller disk.\nOnce a disk is moved, it keeps its relative size ordering with the others.\n\n[STATEMENT]\nThere are 7 disks in total. From smallest to largest they are disk A, disk B, disk C, disk D, disk E, disk F, and disk G.\nAs initial conditions I have that, the left peg holds, from top to bottom, disk A, disk B, disk C, disk D, disk E, disk F, and disk G, while the middle peg and the right peg are empty.\nMy goal is to have that the right peg holds, from top to bottom, disk A, disk B, disk C, disk D, disk E, disk F, and disk G, and both the left peg and the middle peg are empty again.\nThe middle peg can be used as an intermediate parking spot but must end up empty.\n\nI will not ask the user for further clarifications and I will report the plan that explicitly states all the (2^7 - 1) intermediate steps to achieve the objective in an optimal way.

PROBLEM
------------------------------
I am practicing the Tower of Hanoi puzzle. Here is the action I can do

Move the top disk from one peg to another peg

I must obey the following rules:
I can move only one disk at a time.
I may only move a disk that is on top of a peg.
I can never place a larger disk on top of a smaller disk.
Once a disk is moved, it keeps its relative size ordering with the others.

[STATEMENT]
There are 7 disks in total. From smallest to largest they are disk A, disk B, disk C, disk D, disk E, disk F, and disk G.
As initial conditions I have that, the left peg holds, from top to bottom, disk A, disk B, disk C, disk D, disk E, disk F, and disk G, while the middle peg and the right peg are empty.
My goal is to have that the right peg holds, from top to bottom, disk A, disk B, disk C, disk D, disk E, disk F, and disk G, and both the left peg and the middle peg are empty again.
The middle peg can be used as an intermediate parking spot but must end up empty.

I will not ask the user for further clarifications and I will report the plan that explicitly states all the (2^7 - 1) intermediate steps to achieve the objective in an optimal way. My plan is as follows:

From smallest to largest they are disk A, disk B, disk C, disk D, disk E, disk F, and disk G.\nAs initial conditions I have that, the left peg holds, from top to bottom, disk A, disk B, disk C, disk D, disk E, disk F, and disk G, while the middle peg and the right peg are empty.\nMy goal is to have that the right peg holds, from top to bottom, disk A, disk B, disk C, disk D, disk E, disk F, and disk G, and both the left peg and the middle peg are empty again.\nThe middle peg can be used as an intermediate parking spot but must end up empty.\n\nI will not ask the user for further clarifications and I will report the plan that explicitly states all the (2^7 - 1) intermediate steps to achieve the objective in an optimal way. My plan is as follows:\n\n[PLAN]",

PROBLEM
------------------------------
I am practicing the Tower of Hanoi puzzle. Here is the action I can do

Move the top disk from one peg to another peg

I must obey the following rules:
I can move only one disk at a time.
I may only move a disk that is on top of a peg.
I can never place a larger disk on top of a smaller disk.
Once a disk is moved, it keeps its relative size ordering with the others.

[STATEMENT]
There are 7 disks in total. From smallest to largest they are disk A, disk B, disk C, disk D, disk E, disk F, and disk G.
As initial conditions I have that, the left peg holds, from top to bottom, disk A, disk B, disk C, disk D, disk E, disk F, and disk G, while the right peg and the middle peg are empty.
My goal is to have that the middle peg holds, from top to bottom, disk A, disk B, disk C, disk D, disk E, disk F, and disk G, and both the left peg and the right peg are empty again.
The right peg can be used as an intermediate parking spot but must end up empty.

I will not ask the user for further clarifications and I will report the plan that explicitly states all the (2^7 - 1) intermediate steps to achieve the objective in an optimal way. My plan is as follows:
