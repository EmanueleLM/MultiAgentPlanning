This is a sequence of 15 instructions to move the stack of disks (A, B, C, D) from the Middle peg (M) to the Right peg (R), using the Left peg (L) as auxiliary.

The initial state is: All disks (A on top, D on bottom) are stacked on the Middle peg (M).

1.  **Move A:** Move disk A from the Middle peg onto the Left peg.
2.  **Move B:** Move disk B from the Middle peg onto the Right peg.
3.  **Move A:** Move disk A from the Left peg onto disk B (on the Right peg).
4.  **Move C:** Move disk C from the Middle peg onto the Left peg.
5.  **Move A:** Move disk A from disk B (on the Right peg) onto disk D (on the Middle peg).
6.  **Move B:** Move disk B from the Right peg onto disk C (on the Left peg).
7.  **Move A:** Move disk A from disk D (on the Middle peg) onto disk B (on the Left peg stack).
8.  **Move D:** Move disk D from the Middle peg onto the Right peg.
9.  **Move A:** Move disk A from disk B (on the Left peg stack) onto disk D (on the Right peg).
10. **Move B:** Move disk B from disk C (on the Left peg) onto the Middle peg.
11. **Move A:** Move disk A from disk D (on the Right peg stack) onto disk B (on the Middle peg stack).
12. **Move C:** Move disk C from the Left peg onto disk D (on the Right peg stack).
13. **Move A:** Move disk A from disk B (on the Middle peg stack) onto the Left peg.
14. **Move B:** Move disk B from the Middle peg onto disk C (on the Right peg stack).
15. **Move A:** Move disk A from the Left peg onto disk B (on the Right peg stack).

The goal state is reached: The stack [A, B, C, D] is now correctly located on the Right peg.
