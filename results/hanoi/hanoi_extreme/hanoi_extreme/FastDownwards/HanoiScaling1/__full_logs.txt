PROBLEM
------------------------------
I am practicing the Tower of Hanoi puzzle. Here is the action I can do

Move the top disk from one peg to another peg

I must obey the following rules:
I can move only one disk at a time.
I may only move a disk that is on top of a peg.
I can never place a larger disk on top of a smaller disk.
Once a disk is moved, it keeps its relative size ordering with the others.

[STATEMENT]
There are 7 disks in total. From smallest to largest they are disk A, disk B, disk C, disk D, disk E, disk F, and disk G.
As initial conditions I have that, the middle peg holds, from top to bottom, disk A, disk B, disk C, disk D, disk E, disk F, and disk G, while the left peg and the right peg are empty.
My goal is to have that the right peg holds, from top to bottom, disk A, disk B, disk C, disk D, disk E, disk F, and disk G, and both the middle peg and the left peg are empty again.
The left peg can be used as an intermediate parking spot but must end up empty.

I will not ask the user for further clarifications and I will report the plan that explicitly states all the (2^7 - 1) intermediate steps to achieve the objective in an optimal way. My plan is as follows:

NATURAL-PLAN sas_plan_2
------------------------------
This is a sequence of 15 instructions to move the stack of disks (A, B, C, D) from the Middle peg (M) to the Right peg (R), using the Left peg (L) as auxiliary.

The initial state is: All disks (A on top, D on bottom) are stacked on the Middle peg (M).

1.  **Move A:** Move disk A from the Middle peg onto the Left peg.
2.  **Move B:** Move disk B from the Middle peg onto the Right peg.
3.  **Move A:** Move disk A from the Left peg onto disk B (on the Right peg).
4.  **Move C:** Move disk C from the Middle peg onto the Left peg.
5.  **Move A:** Move disk A from disk B (on the Right peg) onto disk D (on the Middle peg).
6.  **Move B:** Move disk B from the Right peg onto disk C (on the Left peg).
7.  **Move A:** Move disk A from disk D (on the Middle peg) onto disk B (on the Left peg stack).
8.  **Move D:** Move disk D from the Middle peg onto the Right peg.
9.  **Move A:** Move disk A from disk B (on the Left peg stack) onto disk D (on the Right peg).
10. **Move B:** Move disk B from disk C (on the Left peg) onto the Middle peg.
11. **Move A:** Move disk A from disk D (on the Right peg stack) onto disk B (on the Middle peg stack).
12. **Move C:** Move disk C from the Left peg onto disk D (on the Right peg stack).
13. **Move A:** Move disk A from disk B (on the Middle peg stack) onto the Left peg.
14. **Move B:** Move disk B from the Middle peg onto disk C (on the Right peg stack).
15. **Move A:** Move disk A from the Left peg onto disk B (on the Right peg stack).

The goal state is reached: The stack [A, B, C, D] is now correctly located on the Right peg.

PROBLEM
------------------------------
I am practicing the Tower of Hanoi puzzle. Here is the action I can do

Move the top disk from one peg to another peg

I must obey the following rules:
I can move only one disk at a time.
I may only move a disk that is on top of a peg.
I can never place a larger disk on top of a smaller disk.
Once a disk is moved, it keeps its relative size ordering with the others.

[STATEMENT]
There are 7 disks in total. From smallest to largest they are disk A, disk B, disk C, disk D, disk E, disk F, and disk G.
As initial conditions I have that, the right peg holds, from top to bottom, disk A, disk B, disk C, disk D, disk E, disk F, and disk G, while the middle peg and the left peg are empty.
My goal is to have that the left peg holds, from top to bottom, disk A, disk B, disk C, disk D, disk E, disk F, and disk G, and both the right peg and the middle peg are empty again.
The middle peg can be used as an intermediate parking spot but must end up empty.

I will not ask the user for further clarifications and I will report the plan that explicitly states all the (2^7 - 1) intermediate steps to achieve the objective in an optimal way. My plan is as follows:

NATURAL-PLAN sas_plan_5
------------------------------
This plan executes the optimal sequence of moves (15 steps) required to solve the 4-Disk Tower of Hanoi puzzle, moving all disks from the Right peg to the Left peg.

The disks are A (smallest), B, C, D (largest).

| Step | PDDL Action | Human Instruction |
| :---: | :--- | :--- |
| 1 | `(move-to-peg a b middle)` | Move Disk A (smallest), currently resting on Disk B, to the Middle peg. |
| 2 | `(move-to-peg b c left)` | Move Disk B, currently resting on Disk C, to the Left peg. |
| 3 | `(move-to-disk a middle b)` | Move Disk A from the Middle peg to rest on Disk B. |
| 4 | `(move-to-peg c d middle)` | Move Disk C, currently resting on Disk D, to the Middle peg. |
| 5 | `(move-to-disk a b d)` | Move Disk A, currently resting on Disk B, to rest on Disk D. |
| 6 | `(move-to-disk b left c)` | Move Disk B from the Left peg to rest on Disk C. |
| 7 | `(move-to-disk a d b)` | Move Disk A, currently resting on Disk D, to rest on Disk B. |
| 8 | `(move-to-peg d right left)` | Move Disk D (largest) from the Right peg to the Left peg. |
| 9 | `(move-to-disk a b d)` | Move Disk A, currently resting on Disk B, to rest on Disk D. |
| 10 | `(move-to-peg b c right)` | Move Disk B, currently resting on Disk C, to the Right peg. |
| 11 | `(move-to-disk a d b)` | Move Disk A, currently resting on Disk D, to rest on Disk B. |
| 12 | `(move-to-disk c middle d)` | Move Disk C from the Middle peg to rest on Disk D. |
| 13 | `(move-to-peg a b middle)` | Move Disk A, currently resting on Disk B, to the Middle peg. |
| 14 | `(move-to-disk b right c)` | Move Disk B from the Right peg to rest on Disk C. |
| 15 | `(move-to-disk a middle b)` | Move Disk A from the Middle peg to rest on Disk B. |

**Goal State Reached:** All disks (A/B/C/D) are stacked correctly on the Left peg.
