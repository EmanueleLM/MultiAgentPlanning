This plan executes the optimal sequence of moves (15 steps) required to solve the 4-Disk Tower of Hanoi puzzle, moving all disks from the Right peg to the Left peg.

The disks are A (smallest), B, C, D (largest).

| Step | PDDL Action | Human Instruction |
| :---: | :--- | :--- |
| 1 | `(move-to-peg a b middle)` | Move Disk A (smallest), currently resting on Disk B, to the Middle peg. |
| 2 | `(move-to-peg b c left)` | Move Disk B, currently resting on Disk C, to the Left peg. |
| 3 | `(move-to-disk a middle b)` | Move Disk A from the Middle peg to rest on Disk B. |
| 4 | `(move-to-peg c d middle)` | Move Disk C, currently resting on Disk D, to the Middle peg. |
| 5 | `(move-to-disk a b d)` | Move Disk A, currently resting on Disk B, to rest on Disk D. |
| 6 | `(move-to-disk b left c)` | Move Disk B from the Left peg to rest on Disk C. |
| 7 | `(move-to-disk a d b)` | Move Disk A, currently resting on Disk D, to rest on Disk B. |
| 8 | `(move-to-peg d right left)` | Move Disk D (largest) from the Right peg to the Left peg. |
| 9 | `(move-to-disk a b d)` | Move Disk A, currently resting on Disk B, to rest on Disk D. |
| 10 | `(move-to-peg b c right)` | Move Disk B, currently resting on Disk C, to the Right peg. |
| 11 | `(move-to-disk a d b)` | Move Disk A, currently resting on Disk D, to rest on Disk B. |
| 12 | `(move-to-disk c middle d)` | Move Disk C from the Middle peg to rest on Disk D. |
| 13 | `(move-to-peg a b middle)` | Move Disk A, currently resting on Disk B, to the Middle peg. |
| 14 | `(move-to-disk b right c)` | Move Disk B from the Right peg to rest on Disk C. |
| 15 | `(move-to-disk a middle b)` | Move Disk A from the Middle peg to rest on Disk B. |

**Goal State Reached:** All disks (A/B/C/D) are stacked correctly on the Left peg.
