This sequence of instructions outlines the optimal plan to solve the 7-disk Tower of Hanoi puzzle (Disks A through G, where A is the smallest and G is the largest) by moving all disks from the Middle Peg (P2) to the Right Peg (P3).

The pegs are referred to as:
*   **P1**: Left Peg
*   **P2**: Middle Peg (Source)
*   **P3**: Right Peg (Destination)
