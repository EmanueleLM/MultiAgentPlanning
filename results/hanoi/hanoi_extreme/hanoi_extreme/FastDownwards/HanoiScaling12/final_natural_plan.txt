This is the sequence of 68 actions required to transfer the 6-disk Tower of Hanoi stack from the Right peg (R) to the Left peg (L), obeying the rule that a larger disk cannot be placed on a smaller one. Disks are sized A (smallest) through F (largest).

***Final State Verification:*** Disks A, B, C, D, E are now stacked on disk F, which is located on the Left peg (L). The Left peg holds the complete stack (A/B/C/D/E/F). The Right and Middle pegs are empty. The goal is achieved.
