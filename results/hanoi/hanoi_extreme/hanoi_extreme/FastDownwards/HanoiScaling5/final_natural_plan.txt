This is a detailed sequence of actions required to solve the Tower of Hanoi puzzle for 5 disks (A, B, C, D, E) by moving the entire stack from the Right peg (R) to the Left peg (L), using the Middle peg (M) as temporary storage.

The initial state is: **R** holds (A, B, C, D, E) from top to bottom. **L** and **M** are empty.
