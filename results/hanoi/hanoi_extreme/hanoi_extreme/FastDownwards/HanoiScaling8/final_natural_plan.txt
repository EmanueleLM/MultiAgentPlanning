This sequence of instructions translates the PDDL plan for solving the 6-disk Tower of Hanoi puzzle (moving disks A, B, C, D, E, F from the Middle peg (M) to the Right peg (R)) into human-readable actions.

The actions specify the disk being moved and the base object (either a Peg: L, M, R; or another Disk: A-F) it is moved **from** and **to**.
