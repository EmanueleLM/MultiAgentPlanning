The plan translates the PDDL actions required to move the stack of seven disks (A smallest to G largest) from the Middle Peg (P2) to the Right Peg (P3).

**Initial State:** All seven disks (G bottom, A top) are stacked on P2. P1 and P3 are empty.
**Goal State:** All seven disks (G bottom, A top) are stacked on P3. P1 and P2 are empty.
