PROBLEM
------------------------------
I am practicing the Tower of Hanoi puzzle. Here is the action I can do

Move the top disk from one peg to another peg

I must obey the following rules:
I can move only one disk at a time.
I may only move a disk that is on top of a peg.
I can never place a larger disk on top of a smaller disk.
Once a disk is moved, it keeps its relative size ordering with the others.

[STATEMENT]
There are 6 disks in total. From smallest to largest they are disk A, disk B, disk C, disk D, disk E, and disk F.
As initial conditions I have that, the middle peg holds, from top to bottom, disk A, disk B, disk C, disk D, disk E, and disk F, while the left peg and the right peg are empty.
My goal is to have that the right peg holds, from top to bottom, disk A, disk B, disk C, disk D, disk E, and disk F, and both the middle peg and the left peg are empty again.
The left peg can be used as an intermediate parking spot but must end up empty.

My plan is as follows:

NATURAL-PLAN sas_plan_2
------------------------------
Based on the PDDL specification and the provided plan, the required sequence of human-readable actions to achieve the final stacking configuration is as follows:

| Step | Action | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 1 | `(unstack b o)` | Unstack the Blue block (B) from the Orange block (O). |
| 2 | `(put-down b)` | Place the Blue block (B) onto the table. |
| 3 | `(unstack o y)` | Unstack the Orange block (O) from the Yellow block (Y). |
| 4 | `(put-down o)` | Place the Orange block (O) onto the table. |
| 5 | `(unstack y r)` | Unstack the Yellow block (Y) from the Red block (R). |
| 6 | `(put-down y)` | Place the Yellow block (Y) onto the table. |
| 7 | `(pick-up r)` | Pick up the Red block (R) from the table. |
| 8 | `(stack r o)` | Stack the Red block (R) onto the Orange block (O). |
| 9 | `(pick-up y)` | Pick up the Yellow block (Y) from the table. |
| 10 | `(stack y r)` | Stack the Yellow block (Y) onto the Red block (R). |
