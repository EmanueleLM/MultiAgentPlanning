This sequence of instructions outlines the 74 required moves to transfer the stack of 6 disks (A, B, C, D, E, F) from the Right peg (R) to the Left peg (L), strictly following the Tower of Hanoi rules. Each move is a single unit of action cost.

**Initial State:** Disks A (smallest, top) through F (largest, bottom) are stacked on Peg R. Pegs L and M are empty.
