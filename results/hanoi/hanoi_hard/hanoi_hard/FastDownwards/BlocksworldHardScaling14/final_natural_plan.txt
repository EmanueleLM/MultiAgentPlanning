This sequence of instructions outlines the exact steps required to solve the Tower of Hanoi puzzle, moving all 6 disks (A through F) from the Middle Peg (M) to the Left Peg (L), following the minimum required 63 moves (plus 5 additional moves in this specific plan, for a total of 68 steps).

**Initial Setup:** All disks (A smallest, F largest) are stacked on the **Middle Peg (M)**.
