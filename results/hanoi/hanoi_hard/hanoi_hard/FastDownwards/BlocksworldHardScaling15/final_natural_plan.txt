This is a step-by-step sequence of instructions detailing the movement of 6 disks (A, B, C, D, E, F) from the Right peg (R) to the Middle peg (M), following the strict rules of the Tower of Hanoi puzzle.

### Initial State
All disks are stacked on the Right peg (R) in descending size order (F is bottom, A is top). Left (L) and Middle (M) pegs are empty.
