This is the instruction sequence required to move the stack of six disks (A through F, where A is the smallest and F is the largest) from the Middle Peg (M) to the Right Peg (R), following the rules of the Tower of Hanoi.

**Initial State:** All disks (A-F) are stacked on Peg M. Pegs L and R are empty.
**Goal State:** All disks (A-F) are stacked on Peg R. Pegs L and M are empty.
