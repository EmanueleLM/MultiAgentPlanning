This sequence of actions translates the PDDL plan into human-readable instructions to achieve the goal configuration (R on B, B on Y, Y on O). Each step is assumed to take one unit of time.

### Blocksworld Task Execution Plan

**Initial State:**
*   Stack 1: Red (R) is on Orange (O), Orange (O) is on Blue (B), Blue (B) is on the Table.
*   Stack 2: Yellow (Y) is on the Table.
*   Clear Blocks: R, Y.
*   Hand: Empty.

| Step | Time | Action | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 1 | T=1 | UNSTACK R O | Unstack block Red (R) from block Orange (O). (Holding R) |
| 2 | T=2 | PUT-DOWN R | Put block Red (R) down onto the table. (R is now on table) |
| 3 | T=3 | UNSTACK O B | Unstack block Orange (O) from block Blue (B). (Holding O) |
| 4 | T=4 | PUT-DOWN O | Put block Orange (O) down onto the table. (O is now on table) |
| 5 | T=5 | PICK-UP R | Pick up block Red (R) from the table. (Holding R) |
| 6 | T=6 | STACK R B | Stack block Red (R) onto block Blue (B). |
| 7 | T=7 | PICK-UP Y | Pick up block Yellow (Y) from the table. (Holding Y) |
| 8 | T=8 | STACK Y O | Stack block Yellow (Y) onto block Orange (O). (Y-O stack formed) |
| 9 | T=9 | UNSTACK R B | Unstack block Red (R) from block Blue (B). (Holding R) |
| 10 | T=10 | PUT-DOWN R | Put block Red (R) down onto the table. (R is now on table) |
| 11 | T=11 | PICK-UP B | Pick up block Blue (B) from the table. (Holding B) |
| 12 | T=12 | STACK B Y | Stack block Blue (B) onto block Yellow (Y). (B-Y-O stack formed) |
| 13 | T=13 | PICK-UP R | Pick up block Red (R) from the table. (Holding R) |
| 14 | T=14 | STACK R B | Stack block Red (R) onto block Blue (B). |

**Final State:** The blocks are stacked as required: Red (R) is on Blue (B), Blue (B) is on Yellow (Y), and Yellow (Y) is on Orange (O). **Goal Achieved.**
