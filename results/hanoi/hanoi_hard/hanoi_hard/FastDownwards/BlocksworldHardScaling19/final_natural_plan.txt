The following sequence of actions will arrange the blocks (Blue, Yellow, Orange, Red) from the initial configuration (B/O/R stack, Y on table) into the goal configuration (Y on O, O on R, R on B).

The instructions follow the provided PDDL plan precisely:

1.  **Unstack** the Blue block (B) from the Orange block (O).
2.  **Put down** the Blue block (B) onto the table.
3.  **Unstack** the Orange block (O) from the Red block (R).
4.  **Put down** the Orange block (O) onto the table.
5.  **Pick up** the Red block (R) from the table.
