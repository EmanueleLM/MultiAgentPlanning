PROBLEM
------------------------------
I am practicing the Tower of Hanoi puzzle. Here is the action I can do

Move the top disk from one peg to another peg

I must obey the following rules:
I can move only one disk at a time.
I may only move a disk that is on top of a peg.
I can never place a larger disk on top of a smaller disk.
Once a disk is moved, it keeps its relative size ordering with the others.

[STATEMENT]
There are 6 disks in total. From smallest to largest they are disk A, disk B, disk C, disk D, disk E, and disk F.
As initial conditions I have that, the middle peg holds, from top to bottom, disk A, disk B, disk C, disk D, disk E, and disk F, while the left peg and the right peg are empty.
My goal is to have that the right peg holds, from top to bottom, disk A, disk B, disk C, disk D, disk E, and disk F, and both the middle peg and the left peg are empty again.
The left peg can be used as an intermediate parking spot but must end up empty.

My plan is as follows:

------------------------------
Based on the PDDL specification and the provided plan, the required sequence of human-readable actions to achieve the final stacking configuration is as follows:

| Step | Action | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 1 | `(unstack b o)` | Unstack the Blue block (B) from the Orange block (O). |
| 2 | `(put-down b)` | Place the Blue block (B) onto the table. |
| 3 | `(unstack o y)` | Unstack the Orange block (O) from the Yellow block (Y). |
| 4 | `(put-down o)` | Place the Orange block (O) onto the table. |
| 5 | `(unstack y r)` | Unstack the Yellow block (Y) from the Red block (R). |
| 6 | `(put-down y)` | Place the Yellow block (Y) onto the table. |
| 7 | `(pick-up r)` | Pick up the Red block (R) from the table. |
| 8 | `(stack r o)` | Stack the Red block (R) onto the Orange block (O). |
| 9 | `(pick-up y)` | Pick up the Yellow block (Y) from the table. |
| 10 | `(stack y r)` | Stack the Yellow block (Y) onto the Red block (R). |

PROBLEM
------------------------------
I am practicing the Tower of Hanoi puzzle. Here is the action I can do

Move the top disk from one peg to another peg

I must obey the following rules:
I can move only one disk at a time.
I may only move a disk that is on top of a peg.
I can never place a larger disk on top of a smaller disk.
Once a disk is moved, it keeps its relative size ordering with the others.

[STATEMENT]
There are 6 disks in total. From smallest to largest they are disk A, disk B, disk C, disk D, disk E, and disk F.
As initial conditions I have that, the right peg holds, from top to bottom, disk A, disk B, disk C, disk D, disk E, and disk F, while the middle peg and the left peg are empty.
My goal is to have that the left peg holds, from top to bottom, disk A, disk B, disk C, disk D, disk E, and disk F, and both the right peg and the middle peg are empty again.
The middle peg can be used as an intermediate parking spot but must end up empty.

My plan is as follows:

NATURAL-PLAN sas_plan_2
------------------------------
Based on the PDDL domain, problem definition, and the provided plan, here is the sequence of human-readable actions required to achieve the goal state (Red on Yellow, Yellow on Blue).

### Execution Plan

**Initial State:** Yellow is on Red, Red is on Orange, Orange is on Blue. Blue is on the table.

| Step | Action Description | Current Status (Block Held) |
| :---: | :--- | :--- |
| **1** | **Unstack** the **Yellow** block from the **Red** block. | Holding Yellow |
| **2** | **Put down** the **Yellow** block onto the table. | Hand Empty |
| **3** | **Unstack** the **Red** block from the **Orange** block. | Holding Red |
| **4** | **Stack** the **Red** block onto the **Yellow** block. | Hand Empty |
| **5** | **Unstack** the **Orange** block from the **Blue** block. | Holding Orange |
| **6** | **Put down** the **Orange** block onto the table. | Hand Empty |
| **7** | **Unstack** the **Red** block from the **Yellow** block. | Holding Red |
| **8** | **Put down** the **Red** block onto the table. | Hand Empty |
| **9** | **Pick up** the **Yellow** block from the table. | Holding Yellow |
| **10** | **Stack** the **Yellow** block onto the **Blue** block. | Hand Empty |
| **11** | **Pick up** the **Red** block from the table. | Holding Red |
| **12** | **Stack** the **Red** block onto the **Yellow** block. | Hand Empty |

**Final State Achieved:** Red is on Yellow, and Yellow is on Blue (Blue remains on the table).

PROBLEM
------------------------------
I am practicing the Tower of Hanoi puzzle. Here is the action I can do

Move the top disk from one peg to another peg

I must obey the following rules:
I can move only one disk at a time.
I may only move a disk that is on top of a peg.
I can never place a larger disk on top of a smaller disk.
Once a disk is moved, it keeps its relative size ordering with the others.

[STATEMENT]
There are 6 disks in total. From smallest to largest they are disk A, disk B, disk C, disk D, disk E, and disk F.
As initial conditions I have that, the left peg holds, from top to bottom, disk A, disk B, disk C, disk D, disk E, and disk F, while the middle peg and the right peg are empty.
My goal is to have that the right peg holds, from top to bottom, disk A, disk B, disk C, disk D, disk E, and disk F, and both the left peg and the middle peg are empty again.
The middle peg can be used as an intermediate parking spot but must end up empty.

My plan is as follows:

NATURAL-PLAN sas_plan_3
------------------------------
Based on the provided PDDL plan and the Blocksworld specification, here is the sequence of human-readable instructions to achieve the goal state (Red on Blue, and Yellow on Orange).

**Initial Configuration:** A stack exists where Yellow is on Red, Red is on Orange, and Orange is on Blue (which is on the table). The hand is empty.

| Step | Action | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 1 | `(unstack yellow red)` | Unstack the Yellow block from the Red block. |
| 2 | `(put-down yellow)` | Place the Yellow block down onto the table. |
| 3 | `(unstack red orange)` | Unstack the Red block from the Orange block. |
| 4 | `(put-down red)` | Place the Red block down onto the table. |
| 5 | `(unstack orange blue)` | Unstack the Orange block from the Blue block. |
| 6 | `(put-down orange)` | Place the Orange block down onto the table. |
| 7 | `(pick-up red)` | Pick up the Red block from the table. |
| 8 | `(stack red blue)` | Stack the Red block onto the Blue block. |
| 9 | `(pick-up yellow)` | Pick up the Yellow block from the table. |
| 10 | `(stack yellow orange)` | Stack the Yellow block onto the Orange block. |

**Final State:** The Red block is on the Blue block, and the Yellow block is on the Orange block. The hand is empty.
