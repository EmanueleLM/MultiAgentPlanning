| 2 | `(put-down yellow)` | Place the Yellow block down onto the table. |
| 3 | `(unstack red orange)` | Unstack the Red block from the Orange block. |
| 4 | `(put-down red)` | Place the Red block down onto the table. |
| 5 | `(unstack orange blue)` | Unstack the Orange block from the Blue block. |
| 6 | `(put-down orange)` | Place the Orange block down onto the table. |
| 7 | `(pick-up red)` | Pick up the Red block from the table. |
