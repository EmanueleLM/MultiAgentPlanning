This sequence of instructions outlines the steps required to move all six disks (A, B, C, D, E, F, where A is the smallest and F is the largest) from the starting Peg L to the target Peg M, following the constraints of the Towers of Hanoi puzzle (larger disk cannot be placed on a smaller disk).

**Initial Setup:** All six disks (A/B/C/D/E/F) are stacked on Peg L. Pegs M and R are empty.
