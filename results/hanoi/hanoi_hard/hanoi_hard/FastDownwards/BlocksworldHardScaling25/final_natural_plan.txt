This sequence of actions translates the PDDL plan into human-readable instructions, fulfilling the goal of stacking Blue on Yellow, Yellow on Orange, and Orange on Red.

**Initial State Review:**
The stack configuration is: Orange (O) on Yellow (Y), Yellow (Y) on Blue (B), Blue (B) on Red (R). Red (R) is on the table. The hand is empty.

| 2 | Put Down | Place block **Orange (O)** onto the table. (Hand is now empty) |
| 3 | Unstack | Unstack block **Yellow (Y)** from block **Blue (B)**. (Hand now holds Y) |
| 4 | Stack | Stack block **Yellow (Y)** onto block **Orange (O)**. (Hand is now empty) |
| 5 | Unstack | Unstack block **Blue (B)** from block **Red (R)**. (Hand now holds B) |
| 6 | Put Down | Place block **Blue (B)** onto the table. (Hand is now empty) |
| 7 | Unstack | Unstack block **Yellow (Y)** from block **Orange (O)**. (Hand now holds Y) |
