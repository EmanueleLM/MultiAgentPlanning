This is the sequence of actions required to transform the initial block configuration (Red/Blue/Yellow/Orange stack) into the goal configuration (Yellow/Orange/Red/Blue stack).

Each step corresponds to a single action performed by the agent, assuming unit time for movement.

| Step | Action | Description |
| :--- | :----- | :---------- |
| 1 | `(unstack r b)` | **Unstack Red (R)** from Blue (B). (The hand is now holding Red, and Blue is clear.) |
| 2 | `(put-down r)` | **Put down Red (R)** onto the table. (The hand is now empty.) |
| 3 | `(unstack b y)` | **Unstack Blue (B)** from Yellow (Y). (The hand is now holding Blue, and Yellow is clear.) |
| 4 | `(put-down b)` | **Put down Blue (B)** onto the table. (The hand is now empty.) |
| 5 | `(pick-up r)` | **Pick up Red (R)** from the table. (The hand is now holding Red.) |
| 6 | `(stack r b)` | **Stack Red (R)** onto Blue (B). (The hand is now empty. The R/B stack is formed.) |
| 7 | `(unstack y o)` | **Unstack Yellow (Y)** from Orange (O). (The hand is now holding Yellow, and Orange is clear.) |
| 8 | `(put-down y)` | **Put down Yellow (Y)** onto the table. (The hand is now empty.) |
| 9 | `(pick-up o)` | **Pick up Orange (O)** from the table. (Orange was already clear and on the table. The hand is now holding Orange.) |
| 10 | `(stack o r)` | **Stack Orange (O)** onto Red (R). (The hand is now empty. The O/R/B stack is formed.) |
| 11 | `(pick-up y)` | **Pick up Yellow (Y)** from the table. (The hand is now holding Yellow.) |
| 12 | `(stack y o)` | **Stack Yellow (Y)** onto Orange (O). (The hand is now empty. The final goal stack Y/O/R/B is achieved.) |

The task is completed in 12 steps.
