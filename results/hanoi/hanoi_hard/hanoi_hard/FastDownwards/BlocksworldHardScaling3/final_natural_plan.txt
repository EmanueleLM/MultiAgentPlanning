This sequence of actions describes the movement of six disks (A being the smallest, F the largest) from the Left Peg (L) to the Right Peg (R), following the rules of the Tower of Hanoi puzzle.

The initial state has disks A through F stacked on the Left Peg (L).
The goal is to stack disks A through F on the Right Peg (R).
