This task involves moving six disks (A, B, C, D, E, F, where A is the smallest and F is the largest) from the starting peg (Right/R) to the destination peg (Left/L), using the Middle peg (M) as an auxiliary, following the rules of the Towers of Hanoi puzzle (a larger disk may never be placed atop a smaller disk).

Here is the sequence of 126 actions required to achieve the goal:

1.  Pick up Disk A from on top of Disk B.
2.  Place Disk A onto Peg M (Middle).
3.  Pick up Disk B from on top of Disk C.
4.  Place Disk B onto Peg L (Left).
