The initial setup involves six disks (A, B, C, D, E, F, where A is the smallest and F is the largest) stacked sequentially on the Middle Peg (M). The goal is to move the entire stack to the Right Peg (R), using the Left Peg (L) as auxiliary, following the rules of the Tower of Hanoi.

The following sequence of 66 actions achieves the goal:
