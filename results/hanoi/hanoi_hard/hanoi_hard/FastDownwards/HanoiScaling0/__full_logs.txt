PROBLEM
------------------------------
I am practicing the Tower of Hanoi puzzle. Here is the action I can do

Move the top disk from one peg to another peg

I must obey the following rules:
I can move only one disk at a time.
I may only move a disk that is on top of a peg.
I can never place a larger disk on top of a smaller disk.
Once a disk is moved, it keeps its relative size ordering with the others.

[STATEMENT]
There are 6 disks in total. From smallest to largest they are disk A, disk B, disk C, disk D, disk E, and disk F.
As initial conditions I have that, the middle peg holds, from top to bottom, disk A, disk B, disk C, disk D, disk E, and disk F, while the left peg and the right peg are empty.
My goal is to have that the right peg holds, from top to bottom, disk A, disk B, disk C, disk D, disk E, and disk F, and both the middle peg and the left peg are empty again.
The left peg can be used as an intermediate parking spot but must end up empty.

My plan is as follows:

NATURAL-PLAN sas_plan_5
------------------------------
This sequence of human-readable actions translates the 15-step PDDL plan for moving the stack of 4 disks (A, B, C, D) from the Middle peg (M) to the Right peg (R).

Each action represents one move and corresponds to a unit cost of time.

| Step | Disk | Action | Source Peg | Destination Peg / Disk |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 1 | A | Move Disk A | Middle (M) | Left (L) |
| 2 | B | Move Disk B | Middle (M) | Right (R) |
| 3 | A | Move Disk A | Left (L) | onto Disk B at Right (R) |
| 4 | C | Move Disk C | Middle (M) | Left (L) |
| 5 | A | Move Disk A | Right (R) | onto Disk D at Middle (M) |
| 6 | B | Move Disk B | Right (R) | onto Disk C at Left (L) |
| 7 | A | Move Disk A | Middle (M) | onto Disk B at Left (L) |
| 8 | D | Move Disk D | Middle (M) | Right (R) |
| 9 | A | Move Disk A | Left (L) | onto Disk D at Right (R) |
| 10 | B | Move Disk B | Left (L) | Middle (M) |
| 11 | A | Move Disk A | Right (R) | onto Disk B at Middle (M) |
| 12 | C | Move Disk C | Left (L) | onto Disk D at Right (R) |
| 13 | A | Move Disk A | Middle (M) | Left (L) |
| 14 | B | Move Disk B | Middle (M) | onto Disk C at Right (R) |
| 15 | A | Move Disk A | Left (L) | onto Disk B at Right (R) |

**Result:** All four disks (A, B, C, D) are now stacked correctly on the Right peg (R). Total moves: 15.
