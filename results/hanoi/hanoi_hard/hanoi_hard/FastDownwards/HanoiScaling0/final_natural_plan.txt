This sequence of human-readable actions translates the 15-step PDDL plan for moving the stack of 4 disks (A, B, C, D) from the Middle peg (M) to the Right peg (R).

Each action represents one move and corresponds to a unit cost of time.

| Step | Disk | Action | Source Peg | Destination Peg / Disk |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 1 | A | Move Disk A | Middle (M) | Left (L) |
| 2 | B | Move Disk B | Middle (M) | Right (R) |
| 3 | A | Move Disk A | Left (L) | onto Disk B at Right (R) |
| 4 | C | Move Disk C | Middle (M) | Left (L) |
| 5 | A | Move Disk A | Right (R) | onto Disk D at Middle (M) |
| 6 | B | Move Disk B | Right (R) | onto Disk C at Left (L) |
| 7 | A | Move Disk A | Middle (M) | onto Disk B at Left (L) |
| 8 | D | Move Disk D | Middle (M) | Right (R) |
| 9 | A | Move Disk A | Left (L) | onto Disk D at Right (R) |
| 10 | B | Move Disk B | Left (L) | Middle (M) |
| 11 | A | Move Disk A | Right (R) | onto Disk B at Middle (M) |
| 12 | C | Move Disk C | Left (L) | onto Disk D at Right (R) |
| 13 | A | Move Disk A | Middle (M) | Left (L) |
| 14 | B | Move Disk B | Middle (M) | onto Disk C at Right (R) |
| 15 | A | Move Disk A | Left (L) | onto Disk B at Right (R) |

**Result:** All four disks (A, B, C, D) are now stacked correctly on the Right peg (R). Total moves: 15.
