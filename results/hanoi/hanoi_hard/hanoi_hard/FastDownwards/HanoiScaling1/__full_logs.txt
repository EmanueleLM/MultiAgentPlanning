PROBLEM
------------------------------
I am practicing the Tower of Hanoi puzzle. Here is the action I can do

Move the top disk from one peg to another peg

I must obey the following rules:
I can move only one disk at a time.
I may only move a disk that is on top of a peg.
I can never place a larger disk on top of a smaller disk.
Once a disk is moved, it keeps its relative size ordering with the others.

[STATEMENT]
There are 6 disks in total. From smallest to largest they are disk A, disk B, disk C, disk D, disk E, and disk F.
As initial conditions I have that, the middle peg holds, from top to bottom, disk A, disk B, disk C, disk D, disk E, and disk F, while the left peg and the right peg are empty.
My goal is to have that the right peg holds, from top to bottom, disk A, disk B, disk C, disk D, disk E, and disk F, and both the middle peg and the left peg are empty again.
The left peg can be used as an intermediate parking spot but must end up empty.

My plan is as follows:

NATURAL-PLAN sas_plan_5
------------------------------
This sequence of human-readable actions translates the 15-step PDDL plan for moving the stack of 4 disks (A, B, C, D) from the Middle peg (M) to the Right peg (R).

Each action represents one move and corresponds to a unit cost of time.

| Step | Disk | Action | Source Peg | Destination Peg / Disk |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 1 | A | Move Disk A | Middle (M) | Left (L) |
| 2 | B | Move Disk B | Middle (M) | Right (R) |
| 3 | A | Move Disk A | Left (L) | onto Disk B at Right (R) |
| 4 | C | Move Disk C | Middle (M) | Left (L) |
| 5 | A | Move Disk A | Right (R) | onto Disk D at Middle (M) |
| 6 | B | Move Disk B | Right (R) | onto Disk C at Left (L) |
| 7 | A | Move Disk A | Middle (M) | onto Disk B at Left (L) |
| 8 | D | Move Disk D | Middle (M) | Right (R) |
| 9 | A | Move Disk A | Left (L) | onto Disk D at Right (R) |
| 10 | B | Move Disk B | Left (L) | Middle (M) |
| 11 | A | Move Disk A | Right (R) | onto Disk B at Middle (M) |
| 12 | C | Move Disk C | Left (L) | onto Disk D at Right (R) |
| 13 | A | Move Disk A | Middle (M) | Left (L) |
| 14 | B | Move Disk B | Middle (M) | onto Disk C at Right (R) |
| 15 | A | Move Disk A | Left (L) | onto Disk B at Right (R) |

**Result:** All four disks (A, B, C, D) are now stacked correctly on the Right peg (R). Total moves: 15.

PROBLEM
------------------------------
I am practicing the Tower of Hanoi puzzle. Here is the action I can do

Move the top disk from one peg to another peg

I must obey the following rules:
I can move only one disk at a time.
I may only move a disk that is on top of a peg.
I can never place a larger disk on top of a smaller disk.
Once a disk is moved, it keeps its relative size ordering with the others.

[STATEMENT]
There are 6 disks in total. From smallest to largest they are disk A, disk B, disk C, disk D, disk E, and disk F.
As initial conditions I have that, the right peg holds, from top to bottom, disk A, disk B, disk C, disk D, disk E, and disk F, while the middle peg and the left peg are empty.
My goal is to have that the left peg holds, from top to bottom, disk A, disk B, disk C, disk D, disk E, and disk F, and both the right peg and the middle peg are empty again.
The middle peg can be used as an intermediate parking spot but must end up empty.

My plan is as follows:

NATURAL-PLAN sas_plan_2
------------------------------
This plan translates the PDDL solution for the 4-disk Tower of Hanoi puzzle (moving all disks from the Right peg to the Left peg) into 16 sequential human-readable actions. Disks are labeled A (smallest) through D (largest), and pegs are Left (L), Middle (M), and Right (R).

| Step | Action Description |
| :---: | :--- |
| 1 | Move Disk A (Smallest) from its current position on Disk B (on the Right peg) to the **Middle peg**. |
| 2 | Move Disk B from its current position on Disk C (on the Right peg) to the **Left peg**. |
| 3 | Move Disk A (Smallest) from the Middle peg onto **Disk B** (on the Left peg). |
| 4 | Move Disk C from its current position on Disk D (on the Right peg) to the **Middle peg**. |
| 5 | Move Disk A (Smallest) from Disk B (on the Left peg) onto **Disk D** (on the Right peg). |
| 6 | Move Disk B from the Left peg onto **Disk C** (on the Middle peg). |
| 7 | Move Disk A (Smallest) from Disk D (on the Right peg) onto **Disk B** (on the Middle peg stack). |
| 8 | Move Disk D (Largest) from the Right peg to the **Left peg**. |
| 9 | Move Disk A (Smallest) from Disk B (on the Middle peg stack) to the **Right peg**. |
| 10 | Move Disk A (Smallest) from the Right peg onto **Disk D** (on the Left peg). |
| 11 | Move Disk B from Disk C (on the Middle peg) to the **Right peg**. |
| 12 | Move Disk A (Smallest) from Disk D (on the Left peg) onto **Disk B** (on the Right peg). |
| 13 | Move Disk C from the Middle peg onto **Disk D** (on the Left peg). |
| 14 | Move Disk A (Smallest) from Disk B (on the Right peg) to the **Middle peg**. |
| 15 | Move Disk B from the Right peg onto **Disk C** (on the Left peg). |
| 16 | Move Disk A (Smallest) from the Middle peg onto **Disk B** (on the Left peg). |

**Goal State Achieved:** All four disks (A, B, C, D) are stacked in decreasing size order (A on top, D on bottom) on the Left peg. (Total moves: 16)
