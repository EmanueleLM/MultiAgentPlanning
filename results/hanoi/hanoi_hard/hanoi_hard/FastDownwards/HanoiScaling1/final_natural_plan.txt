This plan translates the PDDL solution for the 4-disk Tower of Hanoi puzzle (moving all disks from the Right peg to the Left peg) into 16 sequential human-readable actions. Disks are labeled A (smallest) through D (largest), and pegs are Left (L), Middle (M), and Right (R).

| Step | Action Description |
| :---: | :--- |
| 1 | Move Disk A (Smallest) from its current position on Disk B (on the Right peg) to the **Middle peg**. |
| 2 | Move Disk B from its current position on Disk C (on the Right peg) to the **Left peg**. |
| 3 | Move Disk A (Smallest) from the Middle peg onto **Disk B** (on the Left peg). |
| 4 | Move Disk C from its current position on Disk D (on the Right peg) to the **Middle peg**. |
| 5 | Move Disk A (Smallest) from Disk B (on the Left peg) onto **Disk D** (on the Right peg). |
| 6 | Move Disk B from the Left peg onto **Disk C** (on the Middle peg). |
| 7 | Move Disk A (Smallest) from Disk D (on the Right peg) onto **Disk B** (on the Middle peg stack). |
| 8 | Move Disk D (Largest) from the Right peg to the **Left peg**. |
| 9 | Move Disk A (Smallest) from Disk B (on the Middle peg stack) to the **Right peg**. |
| 10 | Move Disk A (Smallest) from the Right peg onto **Disk D** (on the Left peg). |
| 11 | Move Disk B from Disk C (on the Middle peg) to the **Right peg**. |
| 12 | Move Disk A (Smallest) from Disk D (on the Left peg) onto **Disk B** (on the Right peg). |
| 13 | Move Disk C from the Middle peg onto **Disk D** (on the Left peg). |
| 14 | Move Disk A (Smallest) from Disk B (on the Right peg) to the **Middle peg**. |
| 15 | Move Disk B from the Right peg onto **Disk C** (on the Left peg). |
| 16 | Move Disk A (Smallest) from the Middle peg onto **Disk B** (on the Left peg). |

**Goal State Achieved:** All four disks (A, B, C, D) are stacked in decreasing size order (A on top, D on bottom) on the Left peg. (Total moves: 16)
