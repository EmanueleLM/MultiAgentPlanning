This sequence of instructions outlines the steps required to move the stack of 6 disks (A being the smallest, F the largest) from the Right peg (R) to the Left peg (L), following the rules of the Tower of Hanoi puzzle.

**Initial State:** All disks (F-A) are stacked on the Right peg (R). Left (L) and Middle (M) pegs are empty.
