The following is the sequence of 40 atomic movements required to solve the 5-disk Tower of Hanoi puzzle, moving all disks from the Left Peg to the Right Peg, adhering strictly to the constraint that no larger disk is placed on a smaller one.

**Initial State:** All disks (A, B, C, D, E) are stacked on the **Left Peg** (E is at the bottom).
