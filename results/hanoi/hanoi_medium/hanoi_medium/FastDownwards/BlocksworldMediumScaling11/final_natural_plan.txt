This sequence of instructions guides the mover agent (MoverBot) through the 5-disk Tower of Hanoi puzzle, moving the entire stack from Peg2 (Middle) to Peg3 (Right), using Peg1 (Left) as the auxiliary peg.

The disks are ordered A (smallest) < B < C < D < E (largest).

### Tower of Hanoi 5-Disk Solution (33 Moves)

1.  **Move 1:** Move Disk A from Peg2 onto Peg3. (Peg3 is now: A)
2.  **Move 2:** Move Disk B from Peg2 onto Peg1. (Peg1 is now: B)
3.  **Move 3:** Move Disk A from Peg3 onto Disk B (at Peg1). (Peg1 is now: B, A)
4.  **Move 4:** Move Disk C from Peg2 onto Peg3. (Peg3 is now: C)
5.  **Move 5:** Move Disk A from Disk B (at Peg1) onto Disk D (at Peg2). (Peg2 is now: D, A)
6.  **Move 6:** Move Disk B from Peg1 onto Disk C (at Peg3). (Peg3 is now: C, B)
7.  **Move 7:** Move Disk A from Disk D (at Peg2) onto Disk B (at Peg3). (Peg3 is now: C, B, A)
8.  **Move 8:** Move Disk D from Peg2 onto Peg1. (Peg1 is now: D)
9.  **Move 9:** Move Disk A from Disk B (at Peg3) onto Disk E (at Peg2). (Peg2 is now: E, A)
10. **Move 10:** Move Disk A from Disk E (at Peg2) onto Disk D (at Peg1). (Peg1 is now: D, A)
11. **Move 11:** Move Disk B from Disk C (at Peg3) onto Disk E (at Peg2). (Peg2 is now: E, B)
12. **Move 12:** Move Disk A from Disk D (at Peg1) onto Disk B (at Peg2). (Peg2 is now: E, B, A)
13. **Move 13:** Move Disk C from Peg3 onto Disk D (at Peg1). (Peg1 is now: D, C)
14. **Move 14:** Move Disk A from Disk B (at Peg2) onto Peg3. (Peg3 is now: A)

16. **Move 16:** Move Disk A from Peg3 onto Disk B (at Peg1). (Peg1 is now: D, C, B, A)
17. **Move 17:** Move Disk E from Peg2 onto Peg3. (Peg3 is now: E)
18. **Move 18:** Move Disk A from Disk B (at Peg1) onto Peg2. (Peg2 is now: A)
19. **Move 19:** Move Disk B from Disk C (at Peg1) onto Disk E (at Peg3). (Peg3 is now: E, B)
20. **Move 20:** Move Disk A from Peg2 onto Disk B (at Peg3). (Peg3 is now: E, B, A)
21. **Move 21:** Move Disk C from Disk D (at Peg1) onto Peg2. (Peg2 is now: C)
22. **Move 22:** Move Disk A from Disk B (at Peg3) onto Disk D (at Peg1). (Peg1 is now: D, A)
23. **Move 23:** Move Disk B from Disk E (at Peg3) onto Disk C (at Peg2). (Peg2 is now: C, B)
24. **Move 24:** Move Disk A from Disk D (at Peg1) onto Disk B (at Peg2). (Peg2 is now: C, B, A)
25. **Move 25:** Move Disk D from Peg1 onto Disk E (at Peg3). (Peg3 is now: E, D)
26. **Move 26:** Move Disk A from Disk B (at Peg2) onto Peg1. (Peg1 is now: A)
27. **Move 27:** Move Disk A from Peg1 onto Disk D (at Peg3). (Peg3 is now: E, D, A)
28. **Move 28:** Move Disk B from Disk C (at Peg2) onto Peg1. (Peg1 is now: B)
29. **Move 29:** Move Disk A from Disk D (at Peg3) onto Disk B (at Peg1). (Peg1 is now: B, A)
30. **Move 30:** Move Disk C from Peg2 onto Disk D (at Peg3). (Peg3 is now: E, D, C)
31. **Move 31:** Move Disk A from Disk B (at Peg1) onto Peg2. (Peg2 is now: A)
32. **Move 32:** Move Disk B from Peg1 onto Disk C (at Peg3). (Peg3 is now: E, D, C, B)
33. **Move 33:** Move Disk A from Peg2 onto Disk B (at Peg3). (Peg3 is now: E, D, C, B, A)

**Goal State Achieved:** All disks are stacked on Peg3, ordered from largest (E) to smallest (A), and Peg1 (Left) is empty. (Total moves: 33).
