This is a step-by-step instruction set detailing the movement of the 5 disks (A being the smallest, E the largest) to transfer the stack from the Right peg to the Middle peg, adhering strictly to the Tower of Hanoi rules.

### Initial State
All 5 disks (A, B, C, D, E) are stacked on the **Right (R)** peg. The **Middle (M)** and **Left (L)** pegs are empty.

### Instructions (40 Steps)

1.  Move Disk A (on B) to Peg Left (L).
2.  Move Disk B (on C) to Peg Middle (M).
3.  Move Disk A (from Peg L) onto Disk B (on Peg M).
4.  Move Disk C (on D) to Peg Left (L).
5.  Move Disk A (on B) onto Disk D (on Peg Right).
6.  Move Disk B (from Peg M) onto Disk C (on Peg L).
7.  Move Disk A (on D) onto Disk B (on Peg L).
8.  Move Disk A (on B) to Peg Middle (M).
9.  Move Disk B (on C) onto Disk D (on Peg Right).
10. Move Disk A (from Peg M) onto Disk B (on Peg Right).
11. Move Disk C (from Peg L) to Peg Middle (M).
12. Move Disk A (on B) to Peg Left (L).
13. Move Disk B (on D) onto Disk C (on Peg M).
14. Move Disk A (from Peg L) onto Disk B (on Peg M).
15. Move Disk D (on E) to Peg Left (L).
16. Move Disk A (on B) onto Disk E (on Peg Right).
17. Move Disk A (on E) onto Disk D (on Peg L).
18. Move Disk B (on C) onto Disk E (on Peg Right).
19. Move Disk A (on D) onto Disk B (on Peg Right).
20. Move Disk C (from Peg M) onto Disk D (on Peg L).
21. Move Disk A (on B) to Peg Middle (M).
22. Move Disk B (on E) onto Disk C (on Peg L).
23. Move Disk A (from Peg M) onto Disk B (on Peg L).
24. Move Disk E (from Peg Right) to Peg Middle (M).
25. Move Disk A (on B) to Peg Right (R).
26. Move Disk B (on C) onto Disk E (on Peg M).
27. Move Disk A (from Peg R) onto Disk B (on Peg M).
28. Move Disk C (on D) to Peg Right (R).
29. Move Disk A (on B) onto Disk D (on Peg L).
30. Move Disk B (on E) onto Disk C (on Peg R).
31. Move Disk A (on D) onto Disk B (on Peg R).
32. Move Disk D (from Peg L) onto Disk E (on Peg M).
33. Move Disk A (on B) to Peg Left (L).
34. Move Disk A (from Peg L) onto Disk D (on Peg M).
35. Move Disk B (on C) to Peg Left (L).
36. Move Disk A (on D) onto Disk B (on Peg L).
37. Move Disk C (from Peg R) onto Disk D (on Peg M).
38. Move Disk A (on B) to Peg Right (R).
39. Move Disk B (from Peg L) onto Disk C (on Peg M).
40. Move Disk A (from Peg R) onto Disk B (on Peg M).

### Final State
All 5 disks are successfully stacked on the **Middle (M)** peg (A on top, E on bottom). The Right (R) and Left (L) pegs are empty.
