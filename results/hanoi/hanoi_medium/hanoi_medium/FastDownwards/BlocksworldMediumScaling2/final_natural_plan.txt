This sequence of instructions translates the PDDL plan for moving the stack of 5 disks (A being the smallest, E the largest) from the Left Peg (L) to the Right Peg (R), using the Middle Peg (M) as auxiliary.

The initial state has disks A, B, C, D, E stacked sequentially on Peg L (A on top of B, ..., E on the base of L).
