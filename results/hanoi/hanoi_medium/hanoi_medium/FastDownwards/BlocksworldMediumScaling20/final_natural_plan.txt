This is the sequence of actions required to move the stack of five disks (A being the smallest, E the largest) from the Right Peg (R) to the Middle Peg (M), following the rules of the Towers of Hanoi.

1. Move Disk A from on top of Disk B to the base of Peg L (Left).
2. Move Disk B from on top of Disk C to the base of Peg M (Middle).
3. Move the bottom Disk A from Peg L onto Disk B.
4. Move Disk C from on top of Disk D to the base of Peg L.
5. Move Disk A from on top of Disk B onto Disk D.
6. Move the bottom Disk B from Peg M onto Disk C.
7. Move Disk A from on top of Disk D onto Disk B.
8. Move Disk A from on top of Disk B to the base of Peg M.
9. Move Disk B from on top of Disk C onto Disk D.
