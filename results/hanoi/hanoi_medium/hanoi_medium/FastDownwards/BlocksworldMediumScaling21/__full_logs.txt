PROBLEM
------------------------------
I am practicing the Tower of Hanoi puzzle. Here is the action I can do

Move the top disk from one peg to another peg

I must obey the following rules:
I can move only one disk at a time.
I may only move a disk that is on top of a peg.
I can never place a larger disk on top of a smaller disk.
Once a disk is moved, it keeps its relative size ordering with the others.

[STATEMENT]
There are 5 disks in total. From smallest to largest they are disk A, disk B, disk C, disk D, and disk E.
As initial conditions I have that, the right peg holds, from top to bottom, disk A, disk B, disk C, disk D, and disk E, while the left peg and the middle peg are empty.
My goal is to have that the middle peg holds, from top to bottom, disk A, disk B, disk C, disk D, and disk E, and both the right peg and the left peg are empty again.
The left peg can be used as an intermediate parking spot but must end up empty.

My plan is as follows:

PROBLEM
------------------------------
I am practicing the Tower of Hanoi puzzle. Here is the action I can do

Move the top disk from one peg to another peg

I must obey the following rules:
I can move only one disk at a time.
I may only move a disk that is on top of a peg.
I can never place a larger disk on top of a smaller disk.
Once a disk is moved, it keeps its relative size ordering with the others.

[STATEMENT]
There are 5 disks in total. From smallest to largest they are disk A, disk B, disk C, disk D, and disk E.
As initial conditions I have that, the left peg holds, from top to bottom, disk A, disk B, disk C, disk D, and disk E, while the right peg and the middle peg are empty.
My goal is to have that the middle peg holds, from top to bottom, disk A, disk B, disk C, disk D, and disk E, and both the left peg and the right peg are empty again.
The right peg can be used as an intermediate parking spot but must end up empty.

My plan is as follows:

There are 5 disks in total. From smallest to largest they are disk A, disk B, disk C, disk D, and disk E.
As initial conditions I have that, the left peg holds, from top to bottom, disk A, disk B, disk C, disk D, and disk E, while the right peg and the middle peg are empty.
My goal is to have that the middle peg holds, from top to bottom, disk A, disk B, disk C, disk D, and disk E, and both the left peg and the right peg are empty again.
The right peg can be used as an intermediate parking spot but must end up empty.

My plan is as follows:

NATURAL-PLAN sas_plan_9
------------------------------
Based on the PDDL plan, the following sequence of actions must be executed to transform the initial block configuration (Blue on Yellow, Orange on Red, Red and Yellow on the table) into the target configuration (Yellow on Red, Red on Orange).

The plan consists of 8 steps:

| Step | Action Description | Effect on State |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **1** | **Unstack** the Blue block (B) from the Yellow block (Y). | The Blue block is now held. The Yellow block (Y) is clear. |
| **2** | **Put down** the Blue block (B) onto the table. | The Blue block is on the table and clear. The hand is empty. |
| **3** | **Unstack** the Orange block (O) from the Red block (R). | The Orange block is now held. The Red block (R) is clear. |
| **4** | **Put down** the Orange block (O) onto the table. | The Orange block is on the table and clear. The hand is empty. |
| **5** | **Pick up** the Red block (R) from the table. | The Red block is now held. |
| **6** | **Stack** the Red block (R) onto the Orange block (O). | The Red block is on the Orange block. The hand is empty. (Achieves `on(R, O)`). |
| **7** | **Pick up** the Yellow block (Y) from the table. | The Yellow block is now held. |
| **8** | **Stack** the Yellow block (Y) onto the Red block (R). | The Yellow block is on the Red block. The hand is empty. (Achieves `on(Y, R)`). |

The goal state, `on(R, O)` AND `on(Y, R)`, is achieved.
