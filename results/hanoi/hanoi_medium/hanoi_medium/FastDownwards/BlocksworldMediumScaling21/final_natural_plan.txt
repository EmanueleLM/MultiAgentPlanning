Based on the PDDL plan, the following sequence of actions must be executed to transform the initial block configuration (Blue on Yellow, Orange on Red, Red and Yellow on the table) into the target configuration (Yellow on Red, Red on Orange).

The plan consists of 8 steps:

| Step | Action Description | Effect on State |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **1** | **Unstack** the Blue block (B) from the Yellow block (Y). | The Blue block is now held. The Yellow block (Y) is clear. |
| **2** | **Put down** the Blue block (B) onto the table. | The Blue block is on the table and clear. The hand is empty. |
| **3** | **Unstack** the Orange block (O) from the Red block (R). | The Orange block is now held. The Red block (R) is clear. |
| **4** | **Put down** the Orange block (O) onto the table. | The Orange block is on the table and clear. The hand is empty. |
| **5** | **Pick up** the Red block (R) from the table. | The Red block is now held. |
| **6** | **Stack** the Red block (R) onto the Orange block (O). | The Red block is on the Orange block. The hand is empty. (Achieves `on(R, O)`). |
| **7** | **Pick up** the Yellow block (Y) from the table. | The Yellow block is now held. |
| **8** | **Stack** the Yellow block (Y) onto the Red block (R). | The Yellow block is on the Red block. The hand is empty. (Achieves `on(Y, R)`). |

The goal state, `on(R, O)` AND `on(Y, R)`, is achieved.
