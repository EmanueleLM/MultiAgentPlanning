This plan describes the steps required to move a stack of 5 disks (A, B, C, D, E, where A is the smallest and E is the largest) from the Left Peg (L) to the Right Peg (R), following the rules of the Tower of Hanoi.

The disks are referenced by size: Disk A (smallest), Disk B, Disk C, Disk D, Disk E (largest). The pegs are Left (L), Middle (M), and Right (R).
