This sequence of instructions outlines the steps required to solve the 5-Disk Tower of Hanoi puzzle, moving the entire stack from the Left peg (L) to the Middle peg (M), using the Right peg (R) as auxiliary storage. Disks are sized A (smallest) through E (largest).

| Step | Action Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| 1 | Move Disk A from the stack on L to Peg R. |
| 2 | Move Disk B from the stack on L to Peg M. |
| 3 | Move Disk A from Peg R to rest on Disk B (on M). |
| 4 | Move Disk C from the stack on L to Peg R. |
| 5 | Move Disk A from Disk B (on M) to rest on Disk D (on L). |
| 6 | Move Disk B from Peg M to rest on Disk C (on R). |
| 7 | Move Disk A from Disk D (on L) to rest on Disk B (on R). |
| 8 | Move Disk A from Disk B (on R) to Peg M. |
| 9 | Move Disk B from Disk C (on R) to rest on Disk D (on L). |
| 10 | Move Disk A from Peg M to rest on Disk B (on L). |
| 11 | Move Disk C from Peg R to Peg M. |
| 12 | Move Disk A from Disk B (on L) to Peg R. |
| 13 | Move Disk B from Disk D (on L) to rest on Disk C (on M). |
| 14 | Move Disk A from Peg R to rest on Disk B (on M). |
| 15 | Move Disk D from the stack on L to Peg R. |
| 16 | Move Disk A from Disk B (on M) to rest on Disk E (on L). |
| 17 | Move Disk A from Disk E (on L) to rest on Disk D (on R). |
| 18 | Move Disk B from Disk C (on M) to rest on Disk E (on L). |
| 19 | Move Disk A from Disk D (on R) to rest on Disk B (on L). |
| 20 | Move Disk C from Peg M to rest on Disk D (on R). |
| 21 | Move Disk A from Disk B (on L) to Peg M. |
| 22 | Move Disk B from Disk E (on L) to rest on Disk C (on R). |
| 23 | Move Disk A from Peg M to rest on Disk B (on R). |
| 24 | **Move Disk E (largest base disk) from Peg L to Peg M.** |
| 25 | Move Disk A from Disk B (on R) to Peg L. |
| 26 | Move Disk B from Disk C (on R) to rest on Disk E (on M). |
| 27 | Move Disk A from Peg L to rest on Disk B (on M). |
| 28 | Move Disk C from Disk D (on R) to Peg L. |
| 29 | Move Disk A from Disk B (on M) to rest on Disk D (on R). |
| 30 | Move Disk B from Disk E (on M) to rest on Disk C (on L). |
| 31 | Move Disk A from Disk D (on R) to rest on Disk B (on L). |
| 32 | Move Disk D from Peg R to rest on Disk E (on M). |
| 33 | Move Disk A from Disk B (on L) to Peg R. |
| 34 | Move Disk A from Peg R to rest on Disk D (on M). |
| 35 | Move Disk B from Disk C (on L) to Peg R. |
| 36 | Move Disk A from Disk D (on M) to rest on Disk B (on R). |
| 37 | Move Disk C from Peg L to rest on Disk D (on M). |
| 38 | Move Disk A from Disk B (on R) to Peg L. |
| 39 | Move Disk B from Peg R to rest on Disk C (on M). |
| 40 | Move Disk A from Peg L to rest on Disk B (on M). |

**Final State:** All disks (E, D, C, B, A) are stacked correctly on the Middle Peg (M). Pegs L and R are clear.
