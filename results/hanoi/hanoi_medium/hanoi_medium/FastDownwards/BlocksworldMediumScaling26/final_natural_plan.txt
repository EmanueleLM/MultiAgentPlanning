This is the sequence of 40 moves required to solve the 5-disk Tower of Hanoi puzzle, moving all disks from the Middle peg to the Left peg.

The disks are A (smallest), B, C, D, and E (largest). The pegs are Left (L), Middle (M), and Right (R).

### Tower of Hanoi Solution (5 Disks: Middle $\rightarrow$ Left)

1.  Move Disk **A** from the Middle stack (off Disk B) to the **Right** peg.
2.  Move Disk **B** from the Middle stack (off Disk C) to the **Left** peg.
3.  Move Disk **A** from the Right peg onto Disk **B** on the Left peg.
4.  Move Disk **C** from the Middle stack (off Disk D) to the **Right** peg.
5.  Move Disk **A** from Disk B (Left) onto Disk **D** on the Middle stack.
6.  Move Disk **B** from the Left peg onto Disk **C** on the Right peg.
7.  Move Disk **A** from Disk D (Middle) to the **Left** peg.
8.  Move Disk **B** from Disk C (Right) onto Disk **D** on the Middle stack.
9.  Move Disk **A** from the Left peg onto Disk **B** on the Middle stack.
10. Move Disk **C** from the Right peg to the **Left** peg.
11. Move Disk **A** from Disk B (Middle) to the **Right** peg.
12. Move Disk **B** from Disk D (Middle) onto Disk **C** on the Left peg.
13. Move Disk **A** from the Right peg onto Disk **B** on the Left peg.
14. Move Disk **D** from the Middle stack (off Disk E) to the **Right** peg.
15. Move Disk **A** from Disk B (Left) onto Disk **E** on the Middle stack.
16. Move Disk **A** from Disk E (Middle) onto Disk **D** on the Right peg.
17. Move Disk **B** from Disk C (Left) onto Disk **E** on the Middle stack.
18. Move Disk **A** from Disk D (Right) onto Disk **B** on the Middle stack.
19. Move Disk **C** from the Left peg onto Disk **D** on the Right peg.
20. Move Disk **A** from Disk B (Middle) onto Disk **C** on the Right stack.
21. Move Disk **A** from Disk C (Right) to the **Left** peg.
22. Move Disk **B** from Disk E (Middle) onto Disk **C** on the Right stack.
23. Move Disk **A** from the Left peg onto Disk **B** on the Right stack.
24. Move Disk **E** from the Middle peg to the **Left** peg.
25. Move Disk **A** from Disk B (Right) to the **Middle** peg.
26. Move Disk **B** from Disk C (Right) onto Disk **E** on the Left peg.
27. Move Disk **A** from the Middle peg onto Disk **B** on the Left peg.
28. Move Disk **C** from Disk D (Right) to the **Middle** peg.
29. Move Disk **A** from Disk B (Left) onto Disk **D** on the Right peg.
30. Move Disk **B** from Disk E (Left) onto Disk **C** on the Middle stack.
31. Move Disk **A** from Disk D (Right) onto Disk **B** on the Middle stack.
32. Move Disk **D** from the Right peg onto Disk **E** on the Left peg.
33. Move Disk **A** from Disk B (Middle) to the **Right** peg.
34. Move Disk **A** from the Right peg onto Disk **D** on the Left peg.
35. Move Disk **B** from Disk C (Middle) to the **Right** peg.
36. Move Disk **A** from Disk D (Left) onto Disk **B** on the Right peg.
37. Move Disk **C** from the Middle peg onto Disk **D** on the Left peg.
38. Move Disk **A** from Disk B (Right) to the **Middle** peg.
39. Move Disk **B** from the Right peg onto Disk **C** on the Left peg.
40. Move Disk **A** from the Middle peg onto Disk **B** on the Left peg.

**Goal State:** All disks (A, B, C, D, E) are stacked on the Left peg.
