This sequence of instructions details the necessary 34 moves to transfer the stack of 5 disks (A, B, C, D, E) from the Right peg (R) to the Left peg (L), strictly following the rules of the Tower of Hanoi puzzle.

**Initial State:** Disks E, D, C, B, A are stacked on the Right peg (R), with A on top.
**Target State:** Disks E, D, C, B, A must be stacked on the Left peg (L), with A on top.
