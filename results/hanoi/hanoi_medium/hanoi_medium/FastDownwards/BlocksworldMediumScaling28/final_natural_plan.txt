This is the step-by-step sequence of actions required to move all 5 disks (A, B, C, D, E) from the Right peg to the Middle peg, following the rules of the Tower of Hanoi puzzle.

**Disks:** A (Smallest) < B < C < D < E (Largest)
**Initial State:** All disks are stacked on the Right peg.
**Goal State:** All disks must be stacked on the Middle peg.
