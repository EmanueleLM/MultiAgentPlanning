PROBLEM
------------------------------
I am practicing the Tower of Hanoi puzzle. Here is the action I can do

Move the top disk from one peg to another peg

I must obey the following rules:
I can move only one disk at a time.
I may only move a disk that is on top of a peg.
I can never place a larger disk on top of a smaller disk.
Once a disk is moved, it keeps its relative size ordering with the others.

[STATEMENT]
There are 5 disks in total. From smallest to largest they are disk A, disk B, disk C, disk D, and disk E.
As initial conditions I have that, the middle peg holds, from top to bottom, disk A, disk B, disk C, disk D, and disk E, while the left peg and the right peg are empty.
My goal is to have that the right peg holds, from top to bottom, disk A, disk B, disk C, disk D, and disk E, and both the middle peg and the left peg are empty again.
The left peg can be used as an intermediate parking spot but must end up empty.

My plan is as follows:

22. Move disk B from on top of disk E onto disk C.
23. Move disk A from peg R onto disk B.
24. Move disk E from peg M to peg R.
25. Move disk A from on top of disk B to peg M.
26. Move disk B from on top of disk C onto disk E.
27. Move disk A from peg M onto disk B.
28. Move disk C from on top of disk D to peg M.
29. Move disk A from on top of disk B onto disk D.

PROBLEM
------------------------------
I am practicing the Tower of Hanoi puzzle. Here is the action I can do

Move the top disk from one peg to another peg

I must obey the following rules:
I can move only one disk at a time.
I may only move a disk that is on top of a peg.
I can never place a larger disk on top of a smaller disk.
Once a disk is moved, it keeps its relative size ordering with the others.

[STATEMENT]
There are 5 disks in total. From smallest to largest they are disk A, disk B, disk C, disk D, and disk E.
As initial conditions I have that, the right peg holds, from top to bottom, disk A, disk B, disk C, disk D, and disk E, while the middle peg and the left peg are empty.
My goal is to have that the left peg holds, from top to bottom, disk A, disk B, disk C, disk D, and disk E, and both the right peg and the middle peg are empty again.
The middle peg can be used as an intermediate parking spot but must end up empty.

My plan is as follows:

------------------------------
This sequence of actions translates the PDDL plan into human-readable instructions to achieve the goal state of having the Red block on top of the Blue block.

| Step | Action (PDDL Translation) | Description |
| :---: | :--- | :--- |
| **1** | UNSTACK ORANGE from BLUE | Pick up the Orange block from on top of the Blue block. (The agent is now holding Orange.) |
| **2** | PUT-DOWN ORANGE | Place the Orange block down onto the Table. (Orange is now on the table; the hand is empty.) |
| **3** | UNSTACK YELLOW from RED | Pick up the Yellow block from on top of the Red block. (The agent is now holding Yellow.) |
| **4** | PUT-DOWN YELLOW | Place the Yellow block down onto the Table. (Yellow is now on the table; the hand is empty.) |
| **5** | PICK-UP RED | Pick up the Red block from the Table. (The agent is now holding Red.) |
| **6** | STACK RED onto BLUE | Place the Red block on top of the Blue block. (The final goal `on(red, blue)` is achieved.) |

PROBLEM
------------------------------
I am practicing the Tower of Hanoi puzzle. Here is the action I can do

Move the top disk from one peg to another peg

I must obey the following rules:
I can move only one disk at a time.
I may only move a disk that is on top of a peg.
I can never place a larger disk on top of a smaller disk.
Once a disk is moved, it keeps its relative size ordering with the others.

[STATEMENT]
There are 5 disks in total. From smallest to largest they are disk A, disk B, disk C, disk D, and disk E.
As initial conditions I have that, the left peg holds, from top to bottom, disk A, disk B, disk C, disk D, and disk E, while the middle peg and the right peg are empty.
My goal is to have that the right peg holds, from top to bottom, disk A, disk B, disk C, disk D, and disk E, and both the left peg and the middle peg are empty again.
The middle peg can be used as an intermediate parking spot but must end up empty.

My plan is as follows:

------------------------------
This sequence of instructions translates the PDDL plan for moving the stack of 5 disks (A being the smallest, E the largest) from the Left Peg (L) to the Right Peg (R), using the Middle Peg (M) as auxiliary.

The initial state has disks A, B, C, D, E stacked sequentially on Peg L (A on top of B, ..., E on the base of L).

PROBLEM
------------------------------
I am practicing the Tower of Hanoi puzzle. Here is the action I can do

Move the top disk from one peg to another peg

I must obey the following rules:
I can move only one disk at a time.
I may only move a disk that is on top of a peg.
I can never place a larger disk on top of a smaller disk.
Once a disk is moved, it keeps its relative size ordering with the others.

[STATEMENT]
There are 5 disks in total. From smallest to largest they are disk A, disk B, disk C, disk D, and disk E.
As initial conditions I have that, the left peg holds, from top to bottom, disk A, disk B, disk C, disk D, and disk E, while the middle peg and the right peg are empty.
My goal is to have that the right peg holds, from top to bottom, disk A, disk B, disk C, disk D, and disk E, and both the left peg and the middle peg are empty again.
The middle peg can be used as an intermediate parking spot but must end up empty.

My plan is as follows:

NATURAL-PLAN sas_plan_1
------------------------------
This is the sequence of human-readable actions required to achieve the goal state:

1. **Unstack R from Y:** Unstack the red block (R) from the yellow block (Y). (The hand is now holding R.)
2. **Put Down R:** Place the red block (R) onto the table. (The red block R is now clear, and the hand is empty.)
3. **Unstack Y from O:** Unstack the yellow block (Y) from the orange block (O). (The hand is now holding Y, and O is now clear.)
4. **Stack Y on R:** Stack the yellow block (Y) onto the red block (R). (Y is now on R, and the hand is empty.)
5. **Pick Up B:** Pick up the blue block (B) from the table. (The hand is now holding B.)
6. **Stack B on O:** Stack the blue block (B) onto the orange block (O). (B is now on O, and the goal is achieved.)
