This is the sequence of 40 instructions required to manipulate the disks according to the plan derived from the Towers of Hanoi problem definition.

The pegs are labeled Left (L), Middle (M), and Right (R). The disks are A (smallest) through E (largest). The goal is to move the entire stack of disks from Peg L to Peg M.
