This plan details the steps required to move all five disks (A, B, C, D, E, where A is the smallest and E is the largest) from the initial Middle peg (M) to the final Right peg (R), adhering strictly to the rules of the Tower of Hanoi puzzle.

**Initial State:** All five disks (E, D, C, B, A) are stacked on the **Middle (M)** peg.
