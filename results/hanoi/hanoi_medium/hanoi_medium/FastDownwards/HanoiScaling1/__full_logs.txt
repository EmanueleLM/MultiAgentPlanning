PROBLEM
------------------------------
I am practicing the Tower of Hanoi puzzle. Here is the action I can do

Move the top disk from one peg to another peg

I must obey the following rules:
I can move only one disk at a time.
I may only move a disk that is on top of a peg.
I can never place a larger disk on top of a smaller disk.
Once a disk is moved, it keeps its relative size ordering with the others.

[STATEMENT]
There are 5 disks in total. From smallest to largest they are disk A, disk B, disk C, disk D, and disk E.
As initial conditions I have that, the middle peg holds, from top to bottom, disk A, disk B, disk C, disk D, and disk E, while the left peg and the right peg are empty.
My goal is to have that the right peg holds, from top to bottom, disk A, disk B, disk C, disk D, and disk E, and both the middle peg and the left peg are empty again.
The left peg can be used as an intermediate parking spot but must end up empty.

My plan is as follows:

NATURAL-PLAN sas_plan_3
------------------------------
This is the sequence of 15 steps required to move the stack of four disks (A, B, C, D) from the Middle peg to the Right peg, adhering to the rules of the Tower of Hanoi puzzle.

**Initial State:** All disks (A, B, C, D) are stacked on the **Middle** peg (A on top, D on bottom). Left and Right pegs are empty.

| Step | PDDL Action | Description |
| :--- | :---------- | :---------- |
| 1 | `(move-dp a b middle left)` | Move disk **A** from the Middle peg (resting on B) to the **Left** peg. (Left is now [A]). |
| 2 | `(move-dp b c middle right)`| Move disk **B** from the Middle peg (resting on C) to the **Right** peg. (Right is now [B]). |
| 3 | `(move-pd a b left right)` | Move disk **A** from the Left peg (its base) onto disk **B** on the Right peg. (Right is now [A, B]). |
| 4 | `(move-dp c d middle left)`| Move disk **C** from the Middle peg (resting on D) to the **Left** peg. (Left is now [C]). |
| 5 | `(move-dd a b d right middle)`| Move disk **A** from disk B on the Right peg onto disk **D** on the Middle peg. (Middle is now [A, D]). |
| 6 | `(move-pd b c right left)` | Move disk **B** from the Right peg (its base) onto disk **C** on the Left peg. (Left is now [B, C]). |
| 7 | `(move-dd a d b middle left)`| Move disk **A** from disk D on the Middle peg onto disk **B** on the Left peg. (Left is now [A, B, C]). |
| 8 | `(move-pp d middle right)` | Move disk **D** from the Middle peg (its base) to the **Right** peg. (Right is now [D]). |
| 9 | `(move-dd a b d left right)`| Move disk **A** from disk B on the Left peg onto disk **D** on the Right peg. (Right is now [A, D]). |
| 10 | `(move-dp b c left middle)` | Move disk **B** from disk C on the Left peg to the **Middle** peg. (Middle is now [B]). |
| 11 | `(move-dd a d b right middle)`| Move disk **A** from disk D on the Right peg onto disk **B** on the Middle peg. (Middle is now [A, B]). |
| 12 | `(move-pd c d left right)` | Move disk **C** from the Left peg (its base) onto disk **D** on the Right peg. (Right is now [C, D]). |
| 13 | `(move-dp a b middle left)`| Move disk **A** from disk B on the Middle peg to the **Left** peg. (Left is now [A]). |
| 14 | `(move-pd b c middle right)`| Move disk **B** from the Middle peg (its base) onto disk **C** on the Right peg. (Right is now [B, C, D]). |
| 15 | `(move-pd a b left right)` | Move disk **A** from the Left peg (its base) onto disk **B** on the Right peg. (Right is now [A, B, C, D]). |

**Final State:** The complete stack [A, B, C, D] rests on the Right peg. The Left and Middle pegs are empty. (Total cost: 15 moves).

PROBLEM
------------------------------
I am practicing the Tower of Hanoi puzzle. Here is the action I can do

Move the top disk from one peg to another peg

I must obey the following rules:
I can move only one disk at a time.
I may only move a disk that is on top of a peg.
I can never place a larger disk on top of a smaller disk.
Once a disk is moved, it keeps its relative size ordering with the others.

[STATEMENT]
There are 5 disks in total. From smallest to largest they are disk A, disk B, disk C, disk D, and disk E.
As initial conditions I have that, the right peg holds, from top to bottom, disk A, disk B, disk C, disk D, and disk E, while the middle peg and the left peg are empty.
My goal is to have that the left peg holds, from top to bottom, disk A, disk B, disk C, disk D, and disk E, and both the right peg and the middle peg are empty again.
The middle peg can be used as an intermediate parking spot but must end up empty.

My plan is as follows:

This task involves solving the 4-disk Tower of Hanoi puzzle, moving all disks (A, B, C, D, where A is the smallest and D is the largest) from the initial Right peg to the final Left peg, using the Middle peg as auxiliary.

Here is the sequence of 16 actions required to complete the puzzle:

1.  **Move Disk A:** Move Disk A from the Right peg to the empty Middle peg.
2.  **Move Disk B:** Move Disk B from the Right peg to the empty Left peg.
3.  **Move Disk A:** Move Disk A from the Middle peg onto Disk B on the Left peg.
4.  **Move Disk C:** Move Disk C from the Right peg to the empty Middle peg.
5.  **Move Disk A:** Move Disk A from the Left peg onto Disk D on the Right peg.
6.  **Move Disk B:** Move Disk B from the Left peg onto Disk C on the Middle peg.
7.  **Move Disk A:** Move Disk A from the Right peg onto Disk B on the Middle peg.
8.  **Move Disk D:** Move Disk D from the Right peg to the empty Left peg.
9.  **Move Disk A:** Move Disk A from the Middle peg onto Disk D on the Left peg.
10. **Move Disk B:** Move Disk B from the Middle peg to the empty Right peg.
11. **Move Disk A:** Move Disk A from the Left peg onto Disk C on the Middle peg.
12. **Move Disk A:** Move Disk A from the Middle peg onto Disk B on the Right peg.
13. **Move Disk C:** Move Disk C from the Middle peg onto Disk D on the Left peg.
14. **Move Disk A:** Move Disk A from the Right peg to the empty Middle peg.
15. **Move Disk B:** Move Disk B from the Right peg onto Disk C on the Left peg.
16. **Move Disk A:** Move Disk A from the Middle peg onto Disk B on the Left peg.

The goal is achieved. All four disks are now stacked correctly (A/B/C/D, top to bottom) on the Left peg.
