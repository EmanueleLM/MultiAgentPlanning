Below is a clear, step-by-step, human-readable execution of the provided PDDL plan. I list each move in order, show the source and target peg for every move, and include a simple timestamp for each step (t0 = 0s, each move takes 1s, so step n occurs from t(n-1) to tn). The sequence exactly matches the 31 moves in the plan and achieves the goal (all disks A..E stacked on the left peg, smallest A on top, middle and right empty).

Step 1 [t0 → t1]: Move disk A from middle to left.
Step 2 [t1 → t2]: Move disk B from middle to right.
Step 3 [t2 → t3]: Move disk A from left to right (place A onto disk B).
Step 4 [t3 → t4]: Move disk C from middle to left.
Step 5 [t4 → t5]: Move disk A from right to middle (place A onto disk D).
Step 6 [t5 → t6]: Move disk B from right to left (place B onto disk C).
Step 7 [t6 → t7]: Move disk A from middle to left (place A onto disk B).
Step 8 [t7 → t8]: Move disk D from middle to right.
Step 9 [t8 → t9]: Move disk A from left to right (place A onto disk D).
Step 10 [t9 → t10]: Move disk B from left to middle (place B onto disk E).
Step 11 [t10 → t11]: Move disk A from right to middle (place A onto disk B).
Step 12 [t11 → t12]: Move disk C from left to right (place C onto disk D).
Step 13 [t12 → t13]: Move disk A from middle to left.
Step 14 [t13 → t14]: Move disk B from middle to right (place B onto disk C).
Step 15 [t14 → t15]: Move disk A from left to right (place A onto disk B).
Step 16 [t15 → t16]: Move disk E from middle to left.
Step 17 [t16 → t17]: Move disk A from right to middle.
Step 18 [t17 → t18]: Move disk B from right to left (place B onto disk E).
Step 19 [t18 → t19]: Move disk A from middle to left (place A onto disk B).
Step 20 [t19 → t20]: Move disk C from right to middle.
Step 21 [t20 → t21]: Move disk A from left to right (place A onto disk D).
Step 22 [t21 → t22]: Move disk B from left to middle (place B onto disk C).
Step 23 [t22 → t23]: Move disk A from right to middle (place A onto disk B).
Step 24 [t23 → t24]: Move disk D from right to left (place D onto disk E).
Step 25 [t24 → t25]: Move disk A from middle to left (place A onto disk D).
Step 26 [t25 → t26]: Move disk B from middle to right.
Step 27 [t26 → t27]: Move disk A from left to right (place A onto disk B).
Step 28 [t27 → t28]: Move disk C from middle to left (place C onto disk D).
Step 29 [t28 → t29]: Move disk A from right to middle.
Step 30 [t29 → t30]: Move disk B from right to left (place B onto disk C).
Step 31 [t30 → t31]: Move disk A from middle to left (place A onto disk B).

Final state at t31: left peg holds (top→bottom) A, B, C, D, E; middle and right pegs are empty. This sequence is legal under the Tower of Hanoi rules (one top disk moved at a time; no larger disk placed on a smaller disk) and matches the provided PDDL plan exactly.
