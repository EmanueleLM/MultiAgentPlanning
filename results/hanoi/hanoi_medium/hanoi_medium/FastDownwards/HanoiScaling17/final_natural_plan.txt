Legend / mapping
- Disks: A = a (smallest), B = b, C = c, D = d, E = e (largest)
- Pegs: Left peg = left-peg, Middle peg = mid-peg, Right peg = right-peg
- Phases/times: phase pN corresponds to time N. Each move is one phase transition, so I report times as N→N+1.

Step-by-step move list (31 unit-time moves)

1. Phase p0 → p1 (time 0 → 1): Move disk A (on top of B) to the middle peg.
2. Phase p1 → p2 (time 1 → 2): Move disk B (on top of C) to the left peg.
3. Phase p2 → p3 (time 2 → 3): Move disk A (from the middle peg) onto disk B.
4. Phase p3 → p4 (time 3 → 4): Move disk C (on top of D) to the middle peg.
5. Phase p4 → p5 (time 4 → 5): Move disk A (on top of B) onto disk D.
6. Phase p5 → p6 (time 5 → 6): Move disk B (from the left peg) onto disk C.
7. Phase p6 → p7 (time 6 → 7): Move disk A (from on D) onto disk B.
8. Phase p7 → p8 (time 7 → 8): Move disk D (on top of E) to the left peg.
9. Phase p8 → p9 (time 8 → 9): Move disk A (on top of B) onto disk D.
10. Phase p9 → p10 (time 9 → 10): Move disk B (on top of C) onto disk E.
11. Phase p10 → p11 (time 10 → 11): Move disk A (on top of D) onto disk B.
12. Phase p11 → p12 (time 11 → 12): Move disk C (from the middle peg) onto disk D.
13. Phase p12 → p13 (time 12 → 13): Move disk A (on top of B) to the middle peg.
14. Phase p13 → p14 (time 13 → 14): Move disk B (from on E) onto disk C.
15. Phase p14 → p15 (time 14 → 15): Move disk A (from the middle peg) onto disk B.
16. Phase p15 → p16 (time 15 → 16): Move disk E from the right peg to the middle peg.
17. Phase p16 → p17 (time 16 → 17): Move disk A (on top of B) to the right peg.
18. Phase p17 → p18 (time 17 → 18): Move disk B (from C) onto disk E.
19. Phase p18 → p19 (time 18 → 19): Move disk A (from the right peg) onto disk B.
20. Phase p19 → p20 (time 19 → 20): Move disk C (on top of D) to the right peg.
21. Phase p20 → p21 (time 20 → 21): Move disk A (from B) onto disk D.
22. Phase p21 → p22 (time 21 → 22): Move disk B (from E) onto disk C.
23. Phase p22 → p23 (time 22 → 23): Move disk A (from D) onto disk B.
24. Phase p23 → p24 (time 23 → 24): Move disk D (from the left peg) onto disk E.
25. Phase p24 → p25 (time 24 → 25): Move disk A (from B) onto disk D.
26. Phase p25 → p26 (time 25 → 26): Move disk B (from C) to the left peg.
27. Phase p26 → p27 (time 26 → 27): Move disk A (from D) onto disk B.
28. Phase p27 → p28 (time 27 → 28): Move disk C (from the right peg) onto disk D.
29. Phase p28 → p29 (time 28 → 29): Move disk A (from B) to the right peg.
30. Phase p29 → p30 (time 29 → 30): Move disk B (from the left peg) onto disk C.
31. Phase p30 → p31 (time 30 → 31): Move disk A (from the right peg) onto disk B.

Final state (after time 31 / phase p31)
- All disks stacked on the middle peg in correct order top→bottom: A on B on C on D on E (with E directly on the middle peg).
- Left peg and right peg are empty.
- Phase p31 reached; total moves = 31.
