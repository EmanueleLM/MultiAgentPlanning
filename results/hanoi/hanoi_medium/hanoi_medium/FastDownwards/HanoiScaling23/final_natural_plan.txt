Below is a clear, step-by-step human-readable execution of the given plan. Each move corresponds exactly to one action in the provided PDDL plan. I show the step number, a timestamp interval assuming each move takes 1 time unit (t0 -> t31), a concise description of the move (disk and source → destination), and the full peg states after the move (each peg listed top → bottom). Initial state (t0): Left = [A, B, C, D, E] (top→bottom), Middle = [], Right = [].

1) t0 → t1 (duration 1): Move disk A from on top of disk B to peg Right.
   Pegs: Left = [B, C, D, E]; Middle = []; Right = [A]

2) t1 → t2 (duration 1): Move disk B from on top of disk C to peg Middle.
   Pegs: Left = [C, D, E]; Middle = [B]; Right = [A]

3) t2 → t3 (duration 1): Move disk A from peg Right onto disk B (on Middle).
   Pegs: Left = [C, D, E]; Middle = [A, B]; Right = []

4) t3 → t4 (duration 1): Move disk C from on top of disk D to peg Right.
   Pegs: Left = [D, E]; Middle = [A, B]; Right = [C]

5) t4 → t5 (duration 1): Move disk A from on top of disk B onto disk D.
   Pegs: Left = [A, D, E]; Middle = [B]; Right = [C]

6) t5 → t6 (duration 1): Move disk B from peg Middle onto disk C (on Right).
   Pegs: Left = [A, D, E]; Middle = []; Right = [B, C]

7) t6 → t7 (duration 1): Move disk A from on top of disk D onto disk B.
   Pegs: Left = [D, E]; Middle = []; Right = [A, B, C]

8) t7 → t8 (duration 1): Move disk D from on top of disk E to peg Middle.
   Pegs: Left = [E]; Middle = [D]; Right = [A, B, C]

9) t8 → t9 (duration 1): Move disk A from on top of disk B onto disk D.
   Pegs: Left = [E]; Middle = [A, D]; Right = [B, C]

10) t9 → t10 (duration 1): Move disk B from on top of disk C onto disk E.
    Pegs: Left = [B, E]; Middle = [A, D]; Right = [C]

11) t10 → t11 (duration 1): Move disk A from on top of disk D onto disk B.
    Pegs: Left = [A, B, E]; Middle = [D]; Right = [C]

12) t11 → t12 (duration 1): Move disk C from peg Right onto disk D (on Middle).
    Pegs: Left = [A, B, E]; Middle = [C, D]; Right = []

13) t12 → t13 (duration 1): Move disk A from on top of disk B to peg Right.
    Pegs: Left = [B, E]; Middle = [C, D]; Right = [A]

14) t13 → t14 (duration 1): Move disk B from on top of disk E onto disk C.
    Pegs: Left = [E]; Middle = [B, C, D]; Right = [A]

15) t14 → t15 (duration 1): Move disk A from peg Right onto disk B.
    Pegs: Left = [E]; Middle = [A, B, C, D]; Right = []

16) t15 → t16 (duration 1): Move disk E from peg Left to peg Right.
    Pegs: Left = []; Middle = [A, B, C, D]; Right = [E]

17) t16 → t17 (duration 1): Move disk A from on top of disk B to peg Left.
    Pegs: Left = [A]; Middle = [B, C, D]; Right = [E]

18) t17 → t18 (duration 1): Move disk B from on top of disk C onto disk E.
    Pegs: Left = [A]; Middle = [C, D]; Right = [B, E]

19) t18 → t19 (duration 1): Move disk A from peg Left onto disk B.
    Pegs: Left = []; Middle = [C, D]; Right = [A, B, E]

20) t19 → t20 (duration 1): Move disk C from on top of disk D to peg Left.
    Pegs: Left = [C]; Middle = [D]; Right = [A, B, E]

21) t20 → t21 (duration 1): Move disk A from on top of disk B onto disk D.
    Pegs: Left = [C]; Middle = [A, D]; Right = [B, E]

22) t21 → t22 (duration 1): Move disk B from on top of disk E onto disk C.
    Pegs: Left = [B, C]; Middle = [A, D]; Right = [E]

23) t22 → t23 (duration 1): Move disk A from on top of disk D onto disk B.
    Pegs: Left = [A, B, C]; Middle = [D]; Right = [E]

24) t23 → t24 (duration 1): Move disk D from peg Middle onto disk E.
    Pegs: Left = [A, B, C]; Middle = []; Right = [D, E]

25) t24 → t25 (duration 1): Move disk A from on top of disk B onto disk D.
    Pegs: Left = [B, C]; Middle = []; Right = [A, D, E]

26) t25 → t26 (duration 1): Move disk B from on top of disk C to peg Middle.
    Pegs: Left = [C]; Middle = [B]; Right = [A, D, E]

27) t26 → t27 (duration 1): Move disk A from on top of disk D onto disk B.
    Pegs: Left = [C]; Middle = [A, B]; Right = [D, E]

28) t27 → t28 (duration 1): Move disk C from peg Left onto disk D.
    Pegs: Left = []; Middle = [A, B]; Right = [C, D, E]

29) t28 → t29 (duration 1): Move disk A from on top of disk B to peg Left.
    Pegs: Left = [A]; Middle = [B]; Right = [C, D, E]

30) t29 → t30 (duration 1): Move disk B from peg Middle onto disk C.
    Pegs: Left = [A]; Middle = []; Right = [B, C, D, E]

31) t30 → t31 (duration 1): Move disk A from peg Left onto disk B.
    Pegs (final at t31): Left = []; Middle = []; Right = [A, B, C, D, E]

Final state (t31): Right peg holds A (top), B, C, D, E (bottom) in the required order; Left and Middle are empty. Total moves = 31 (each move shown as one time unit tN→tN+1). This sequence matches the provided plan exactly and respects the rules (single top-disk moves, never place larger on smaller).
