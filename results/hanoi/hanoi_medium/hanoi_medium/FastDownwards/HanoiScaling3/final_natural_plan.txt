This sequence of instructions outlines the 50 steps required to move the stack of five disks (A, B, C, D, E) from the Left Peg (L) to the Right Peg (R), adhering strictly to the Tower of Hanoi rules.

**Initial State:** All five disks are stacked on the Left Peg (L), with A (smallest) on top and E (largest) at the bottom. The Middle Peg (M) and Right Peg (R) are empty.
**Goal:** All five disks are stacked on the Right Peg (R).
