Summary: 31 moves, each move advances one stage (s0 -> s1 -> ... -> s31). Each move duration: 1 time unit. Final state after step 31: full stack E (bottom) -> D -> C -> B -> A (top) on peg right; pegs left and middle empty.

Step-by-step (Move # — stage — duration = 1 unit):
1. Step 1 (s0 -> s1), 1 unit: Move disk A from on top of disk B (left peg) to peg RIGHT (onto empty peg).
2. Step 2 (s1 -> s2), 1 unit: Move disk B from on top of disk C (left peg) to peg MIDDLE (onto empty peg).
3. Step 3 (s2 -> s3), 1 unit: Move disk A from peg RIGHT onto disk B (on MIDDLE).
4. Step 4 (s3 -> s4), 1 unit: Move disk C from on top of disk D (left peg) to peg RIGHT (onto empty peg).
5. Step 5 (s4 -> s5), 1 unit: Move disk A from on top of disk B (MIDDLE) onto disk D (left peg).
6. Step 6 (s5 -> s6), 1 unit: Move disk B from peg MIDDLE onto disk C (on RIGHT).
7. Step 7 (s6 -> s7), 1 unit: Move disk A from on top of disk D (left peg) onto disk B (now on C on RIGHT).
8. Step 8 (s7 -> s8), 1 unit: Move disk D from on top of disk E (left peg) to peg MIDDLE (onto empty peg).
9. Step 9 (s8 -> s9), 1 unit: Move disk A from on top of disk B (RIGHT) onto disk D (on MIDDLE).
10. Step 10 (s9 -> s10), 1 unit: Move disk B from on top of disk C (RIGHT) onto disk E (left peg).
11. Step 11 (s10 -> s11), 1 unit: Move disk A from on top of disk D (MIDDLE) onto disk B (now on E on LEFT).
12. Step 12 (s11 -> s12), 1 unit: Move disk C from peg RIGHT onto disk D (on MIDDLE).
13. Step 13 (s12 -> s13), 1 unit: Move disk A from on top of disk B (LEFT) to peg RIGHT (onto empty peg).
14. Step 14 (s13 -> s14), 1 unit: Move disk B from on top of disk E (LEFT) onto disk C (on MIDDLE).
15. Step 15 (s14 -> s15), 1 unit: Move disk A from peg RIGHT onto disk B (on MIDDLE).
16. Step 16 (s15 -> s16), 1 unit: Move disk E from peg LEFT to peg RIGHT (onto empty peg).
17. Step 17 (s16 -> s17), 1 unit: Move disk A from on top of disk B (MIDDLE) to peg LEFT (onto empty peg).
18. Step 18 (s17 -> s18), 1 unit: Move disk B from on top of disk C (MIDDLE) onto disk E (on RIGHT).
19. Step 19 (s18 -> s19), 1 unit: Move disk A from peg LEFT onto disk B (on E on RIGHT).
20. Step 20 (s19 -> s20), 1 unit: Move disk C from on top of disk D (MIDDLE) to peg LEFT (onto empty peg).
21. Step 21 (s20 -> s21), 1 unit: Move disk A from on top of disk B (RIGHT) onto disk D (on MIDDLE).
22. Step 22 (s21 -> s22), 1 unit: Move disk B from on top of disk E (RIGHT) onto disk C (on LEFT).
23. Step 23 (s22 -> s23), 1 unit: Move disk A from on top of disk D (MIDDLE) onto disk B (on C on LEFT).
24. Step 24 (s23 -> s24), 1 unit: Move disk D from peg MIDDLE onto disk E (on RIGHT).
25. Step 25 (s24 -> s25), 1 unit: Move disk A from on top of disk B (LEFT) onto disk D (on E on RIGHT).
26. Step 26 (s25 -> s26), 1 unit: Move disk B from on top of disk C (LEFT) to peg MIDDLE (onto empty peg).
27. Step 27 (s26 -> s27), 1 unit: Move disk A from on top of disk D (RIGHT) onto disk B (on MIDDLE).
28. Step 28 (s27 -> s28), 1 unit: Move disk C from peg LEFT onto disk D (on RIGHT).
29. Step 29 (s28 -> s29), 1 unit: Move disk A from on top of disk B (MIDDLE) to peg LEFT (onto empty peg).
30. Step 30 (s29 -> s30), 1 unit: Move disk B from peg MIDDLE onto disk C (on D on RIGHT).
31. Step 31 (s30 -> s31), 1 unit: Move disk A from peg LEFT onto disk B (on C on RIGHT).

Final verification (after s31, total cost 31 units):
- Right peg holds, from bottom to top: E, D, C, B, A.
- Left peg: empty.
- Middle peg: empty.
- All moves respected the rules: each moved disk was top/clear at its source; every placement was either onto an empty peg or onto a larger disk.
