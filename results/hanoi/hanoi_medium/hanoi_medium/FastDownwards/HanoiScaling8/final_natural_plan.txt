Final state after the sequence (verified by the auditor):
- All disks A (top), B, C, D, E (bottom) are on the right peg.
- Every step step1..step31 has been audited and the current step cursor is at step32.
- The sequence strictly follows the single-top-disk move rule and never places a larger disk on a smaller disk (each audit confirmed legality).
