Assume each atomic move takes 1 time unit. I list the 31 moves in order with start→end timestamps (integer time units) and the stage transition from the plan.

1. Time 0 → 1 (stage0 → stage1): move-to-peg(A from on top of B → right).
   - Move disk A from on top of disk B to the right peg.

   - Move disk B from on top of disk C to the left peg.

   - Move disk A from the right peg onto disk B.

15. Time 14 → 15 (stage14 → stage15): move-to-disk(A from right → on top of B).
    - Move disk A from the right peg onto disk B.

16. Time 15 → 16 (stage15 → stage16): move-to-peg(E from middle → right).
    - Move disk E from the middle peg to the right peg.

17. Time 16 → 17 (stage16 → stage17): move-to-peg(A from on top of B → middle).
    - Move disk A from on top of disk B to the middle peg.

18. Time 17 → 18 (stage17 → stage18): move-to-disk(B from on top of C → on top of E).
    - Move disk B from on top of disk C onto disk E.

19. Time 18 → 19 (stage18 → stage19): move-to-disk(A from middle → on top of B).
    - Move disk A from the middle peg onto disk B.

20. Time 19 → 20 (stage19 → stage20): move-to-peg(C from on top of D → middle).
    - Move disk C from on top of disk D to the middle peg.

21. Time 20 → 21 (stage20 → stage21): move-to-disk(A from on top of B → on top of D).
    - Move disk A from on top of disk B onto disk D.

22. Time 21 → 22 (stage21 → stage22): move-to-disk(B from on top of E → on top of C).
    - Move disk B from on top of disk E onto disk C.

23. Time 22 → 23 (stage22 → stage23): move-to-disk(A from on top of D → on top of B).
    - Move disk A from on top of disk D onto disk B.

24. Time 23 → 24 (stage23 → stage24): move-to-disk(D from left → on top of E).
    - Move disk D from the left peg onto disk E.

25. Time 24 → 25 (stage24 → stage25): move-to-disk(A from on top of B → on top of D).
    - Move disk A from on top of disk B onto disk D.

26. Time 25 → 26 (stage25 → stage26): move-to-peg(B from on top of C → left).
    - Move disk B from on top of disk C to the left peg.

27. Time 26 → 27 (stage26 → stage27): move-to-disk(A from on top of D → on top of B).
    - Move disk A from on top of disk D onto disk B.

28. Time 27 → 28 (stage27 → stage28): move-to-disk(C from middle → on top of D).
    - Move disk C from the middle peg onto disk D.

29. Time 28 → 29 (stage28 → stage29): move-to-peg(A from on top of B → middle).

31. Time 30 → 31 (stage30 → stage31): move-to-disk(A from middle → on top of B).
    - Move disk A from the middle peg onto disk B.

Final state after Time 31 (stage31): all moves executed (31 moves). The right peg holds from top to bottom A, B, C, D, E, and left and middle pegs are empty — matching the specified goal. Each listed step corresponds exactly to the plan steps and respects the single-top-disk move and larger-not-on-smaller constraints.
