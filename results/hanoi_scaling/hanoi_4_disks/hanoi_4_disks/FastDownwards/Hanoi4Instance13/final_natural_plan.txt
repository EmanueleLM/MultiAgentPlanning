Plan (15 steps). Timestamps start at 00:00:00, each move duration = 00:00:10.

1) 00:00:00 (duration 00:00:10) — left_controller moves disk A (top disk sitting on disk B) from left peg to middle peg (onto empty middle peg).

2) 00:00:10 (duration 00:00:10) — left_controller moves disk B (top disk sitting on disk C) from left peg to right peg (onto empty right peg).

3) 00:00:20 (duration 00:00:10) — middle_controller moves disk A from middle peg onto disk B on the right peg (A placed on top of B at right).

4) 00:00:30 (duration 00:00:10) — left_controller moves disk C (top disk sitting on disk D) from left peg to middle peg (onto empty middle peg).

5) 00:00:40 (duration 00:00:10) — right_controller moves disk A (top disk on B at right) from right peg to left peg and places it on top of disk D at left.

6) 00:00:50 (duration 00:00:10) — right_controller moves disk B (top disk at right) from right peg onto disk C at middle peg (B placed on C at middle).

7) 00:01:00 (duration 00:00:10) — left_controller moves disk A (top disk sitting on disk D at left) from left peg onto disk B at middle peg (A placed on B at middle).

8) 00:01:10 (duration 00:00:10) — left_controller moves disk D (bottom disk) from left peg to right peg (onto empty right peg).

9) 00:01:20 (duration 00:00:10) — middle_controller moves disk A (top disk on B at middle) from middle peg onto disk D at right peg (A placed on D at right).

10) 00:01:30 (duration 00:00:10) — middle_controller moves disk B (top disk sitting on disk C at middle) from middle peg to left peg (onto empty left peg).

11) 00:01:40 (duration 00:00:10) — right_controller moves disk A (top disk on D at right) from right peg to left peg and places it on top of disk B at left.

12) 00:01:50 (duration 00:00:10) — middle_controller moves disk C (top disk at middle) from middle peg onto disk D at right peg (C placed on D at right).

13) 00:02:00 (duration 00:00:10) — left_controller moves disk A (top disk on B at left) from left peg to middle peg (onto empty middle peg).

14) 00:02:10 (duration 00:00:10) — left_controller moves disk B (top disk at left) from left peg onto disk C at right peg (B placed on C at right).

15) 00:02:20 (duration 00:00:10) — middle_controller moves disk A (top disk at middle) from middle peg onto disk B at right peg (A placed on B at right).

Result: All disks are on the right peg in top-to-bottom order A, B, C, D — goal achieved.
