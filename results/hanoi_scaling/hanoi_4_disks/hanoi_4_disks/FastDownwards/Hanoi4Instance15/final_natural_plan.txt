Plan execution (each action duration = 1.0 time unit). I list the original PDDL action, then a concise human-readable description and the timestamp for that action.

1) (move-to-peg a b middle)
   - Description: Move disk A (the smallest) from on top of disk B to the middle peg.
   - Time: start 0.0 → end 1.0 (duration 1.0)

2) (move-to-peg b c right)
   - Description: Move disk B from on top of disk C to the right peg.
   - Time: start 1.0 → end 2.0 (duration 1.0)

3) (move-to-disk a middle b)
   - Description: Move disk A from the middle peg onto disk B (placing A on top of B).
   - Time: start 2.0 → end 3.0 (duration 1.0)

4) (move-to-peg c d middle)
   - Description: Move disk C from on top of disk D to the middle peg.
   - Time: start 3.0 → end 4.0 (duration 1.0)

5) (move-to-disk a b d)
   - Description: Move disk A from on top of disk B onto disk D (place A on D).
   - Time: start 4.0 → end 5.0 (duration 1.0)

6) (move-to-disk b right c)
   - Description: Move disk B from the right peg onto disk C (place B on C).
   - Time: start 5.0 → end 6.0 (duration 1.0)

7) (move-to-disk a d b)
   - Description: Move disk A from on top of disk D onto disk B (place A on B).
   - Time: start 6.0 → end 7.0 (duration 1.0)

8) (move-to-peg d left right)
   - Description: Move disk D (the largest) from the left peg to the right peg.
   - Time: start 7.0 → end 8.0 (duration 1.0)

9) (move-to-peg a b left)
   - Description: Move disk A from on top of disk B to the left peg.
   - Time: start 8.0 → end 9.0 (duration 1.0)

10) (move-to-disk a left d)
    - Description: Move disk A from the left peg onto disk D (place A on D).
    - Time: start 9.0 → end 10.0 (duration 1.0)

11) (move-to-peg b c left)
    - Description: Move disk B from on top of disk C to the left peg.
    - Time: start 10.0 → end 11.0 (duration 1.0)

12) (move-to-disk a d b)
    - Description: Move disk A from on top of disk D onto disk B (place A on B).
    - Time: start 11.0 → end 12.0 (duration 1.0)

13) (move-to-disk c middle d)
    - Description: Move disk C from the middle peg onto disk D (place C on D).
    - Time: start 12.0 → end 13.0 (duration 1.0)

14) (move-to-peg a b middle)
    - Description: Move disk A from on top of disk B to the middle peg.
    - Time: start 13.0 → end 14.0 (duration 1.0)

15) (move-to-disk b left c)
    - Description: Move disk B from the left peg onto disk C (place B on C).
    - Time: start 14.0 → end 15.0 (duration 1.0)

16) (move-to-disk a middle b)
    - Description: Move disk A from the middle peg onto disk B (place A on B).
    - Time: start 15.0 → end 16.0 (duration 1.0)

Total plan duration: 16.0 time units.
Result: All four disks A (top), B, C, D (bottom) are on the right peg in the required order; left and middle pegs are empty.
