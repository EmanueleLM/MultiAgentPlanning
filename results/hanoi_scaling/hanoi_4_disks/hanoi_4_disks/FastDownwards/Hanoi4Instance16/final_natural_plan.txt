Plan (human-readable, step-by-step). Each move is shown with a simple timestamp (start time in seconds) and an assumed duration of 1s per move.

Initial state: left peg (top->bottom) A, B, C, D; middle empty; right empty.

1) t=0s (duration 1s): Move disk A from on top of disk B to the middle peg.
2) t=1s (duration 1s): Move disk B from on top of disk C to the right peg.
3) t=2s (duration 1s): Move disk A from the middle peg onto disk B (on the right peg).
4) t=3s (duration 1s): Move disk C from on top of disk D to the middle peg.
5) t=4s (duration 1s): Move disk A from on top of disk B onto disk D.
6) t=5s (duration 1s): Move disk B from the right peg onto disk C.
7) t=6s (duration 1s): Move disk A from on top of disk D onto disk B.
8) t=7s (duration 1s): Move disk D from the left peg to the right peg.
9) t=8s (duration 1s): Move disk A from on top of disk B to the left peg.
10) t=9s (duration 1s): Move disk A from the left peg onto disk D (on the right peg).
11) t=10s (duration 1s): Move disk B from on top of disk C to the left peg.
12) t=11s (duration 1s): Move disk A from on top of disk D onto disk B.
13) t=12s (duration 1s): Move disk C from the middle peg onto disk D.
14) t=13s (duration 1s): Move disk A from on top of disk B to the middle peg.
15) t=14s (duration 1s): Move disk B from the left peg onto disk C.
16) t=15s (duration 1s): Move disk A from the middle peg onto disk B.

Final state achieved: left peg empty; middle peg empty; right peg (top->bottom) A, B, C, D. Total moves: 16 (unit cost per move).
