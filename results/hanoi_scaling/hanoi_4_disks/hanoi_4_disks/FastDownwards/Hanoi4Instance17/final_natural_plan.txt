Initial state (t = 0): left peg top-to-bottom A, B, C, D; middle peg empty; right peg empty.

All actions take 1 time unit each. Timestamps below are cumulative.

1) t = 0 → 1
   Move disk A from on top of disk B to peg middle.
2) t = 1 → 2
   Move disk B from on top of disk C to peg right.
3) t = 2 → 3
   Move disk A from peg middle onto disk B (on right).
4) t = 3 → 4
   Move disk C from on top of disk D to peg middle.
5) t = 4 → 5
   Move disk A from on top of disk B (on right) onto disk D (on left).
6) t = 5 → 6
   Move disk B from peg right onto disk C (on middle).
7) t = 6 → 7
   Move disk A from on top of disk D onto disk B.
8) t = 7 → 8
   Move disk D from peg left to peg right.
9) t = 8 → 9
   Move disk A from on top of disk B onto disk D.
10) t = 9 → 10
    Move disk B from on top of disk C to peg left.
11) t = 10 → 11
    Move disk A from on top of disk D onto disk B.
12) t = 11 → 12
    Move disk C from peg middle onto disk D.
13) t = 12 → 13
    Move disk A from on top of disk B to peg middle.
14) t = 13 → 14
    Move disk B from peg left onto disk C.
15) t = 14 → 15
    Move disk A from peg middle onto disk B.

Final state (t = 15): right peg top-to-bottom A, B, C, D; left peg empty; middle peg empty. Goal achieved.
