Assumptions: each action takes 1 time unit. Timestamps are cumulative, starting at t = 0. Disk labels: A (smallest), B, C, D (largest). Pegs: left, middle, right.

1) t = 0 → 1 (duration 1)
   Move disk A from on top of disk B to peg middle.
   (move-to-place A from B to middle)

2) t = 1 → 2 (duration 1)
   Move disk B from on top of disk C to peg right.
   (move-to-place B from C to right)

3) t = 2 → 3 (duration 1)
   Move disk A from peg middle onto disk B (on right).
   (move-to-disk A from middle onto B)

4) t = 3 → 4 (duration 1)
   Move disk C from on top of disk D to peg middle.
   (move-to-place C from D to middle)

5) t = 4 → 5 (duration 1)
   Move disk A from on top of disk B onto disk D.
   (move-to-disk A from B onto D)

6) t = 5 → 6 (duration 1)
   Move disk B from peg right onto disk C.
   (move-to-disk B from right onto C)

7) t = 6 → 7 (duration 1)
   Move disk A from on top of disk D onto disk B.
   (move-to-disk A from D onto B)

8) t = 7 → 8 (duration 1)
   Move disk D from peg left to peg right.
   (move-to-place D from left to right)

9) t = 8 → 9 (duration 1)
   Move disk A from on top of disk B to peg left.
   (move-to-place A from B to left)

10) t = 9 → 10 (duration 1)
    Move disk A from peg left onto disk D.
    (move-to-disk A from left onto D)

11) t = 10 → 11 (duration 1)
    Move disk B from on top of disk C to peg left.
    (move-to-place B from C to left)

12) t = 11 → 12 (duration 1)
    Move disk A from on top of disk D onto disk B.
    (move-to-disk A from D onto B)

13) t = 12 → 13 (duration 1)
    Move disk C from peg middle onto disk D.
    (move-to-disk C from middle onto D)

14) t = 13 → 14 (duration 1)
    Move disk A from on top of disk B to peg middle.
    (move-to-place A from B to middle)

15) t = 14 → 15 (duration 1)
    Move disk B from peg left onto disk C.
    (move-to-disk B from left onto C)

16) t = 15 → 16 (duration 1)
    Move disk A from peg middle onto disk B.
    (move-to-disk A from middle onto B)

Result at t = 16: all disks moved to the right peg in correct order (top to bottom: A, B, C, D). Total cost = 16 (unit cost).
