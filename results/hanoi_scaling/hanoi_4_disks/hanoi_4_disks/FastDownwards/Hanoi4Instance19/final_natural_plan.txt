Step 1 — t=0.0s (duration 1.0s): Move disk A from the top of disk B to the middle peg.
Step 2 — t=1.0s (duration 1.0s): Move disk B from the top of disk C to the right peg.
Step 3 — t=2.0s (duration 1.0s): Move disk A from the middle peg onto disk B (on the right peg).
Step 4 — t=3.0s (duration 1.0s): Move disk C from the top of disk D to the middle peg.
Step 5 — t=4.0s (duration 1.0s): Move disk A from disk B (on the right peg) onto disk D (on the left peg).
Step 6 — t=5.0s (duration 1.0s): Move disk B from the right peg onto disk C (on the middle peg).
Step 7 — t=6.0s (duration 1.0s): Move disk A from disk D (left peg) onto disk B (on C on the middle peg).
Step 8 — t=7.0s (duration 1.0s): Move disk D from the left peg to the right peg.
Step 9 — t=8.0s (duration 1.0s): Move disk A from disk B onto disk D (on the right peg).
Step 10 — t=9.0s (duration 1.0s): Move disk B from disk C to the left peg.
Step 11 — t=10.0s (duration 1.0s): Move disk A from disk D onto disk B (on the left peg).
Step 12 — t=11.0s (duration 1.0s): Move disk C from the middle peg onto disk D (on the right peg).
Step 13 — t=12.0s (duration 1.0s): Move disk A from disk B to the middle peg.
Step 14 — t=13.0s (duration 1.0s): Move disk B from the left peg onto disk C (on the right peg).
Step 15 — t=14.0s (duration 1.0s): Move disk A from the middle peg onto disk B (on the right peg).

t=15.0s: Final state reached — right peg holds the full stack top-to-bottom A, B, C, D; left and middle pegs are empty. (Total moves = 15, unit duration per move)
