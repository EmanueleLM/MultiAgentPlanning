Summary of actions (matches the provided plan exactly). Each step lists the plan action name, a simple human-readable description, and a timestamp (assumed 10s per move for demonstration).

Start time: 00:00:00

1) (move-a-left-middle) — Move disk A from left to middle.
   Time: 00:00:00 → 00:00:10

2) (move-b-left-right) — Move disk B from left to right.
   Time: 00:00:10 → 00:00:20

3) (move-a-middle-right) — Move disk A from middle to right.
   Time: 00:00:20 → 00:00:30

4) (move-c-left-middle) — Move disk C from left to middle.
   Time: 00:00:30 → 00:00:40

5) (move-a-right-left) — Move disk A from right to left.
   Time: 00:00:40 → 00:00:50

6) (move-b-right-middle) — Move disk B from right to middle.
   Time: 00:00:50 → 00:01:00

7) (move-a-left-middle) — Move disk A from left to middle.
   Time: 00:01:00 → 00:01:10

8) (move-d-left-right) — Move disk D from left to right.
   Time: 00:01:10 → 00:01:20

9) (move-a-middle-left) — Move disk A from middle to left.
   Time: 00:01:20 → 00:01:30

10) (move-a-left-right) — Move disk A from left to right.
    Time: 00:01:30 → 00:01:40

11) (move-b-middle-left) — Move disk B from middle to left.
    Time: 00:01:40 → 00:01:50

12) (move-a-right-left) — Move disk A from right to left.
    Time: 00:01:50 → 00:02:00

13) (move-c-middle-right) — Move disk C from middle to right.
    Time: 00:02:00 → 00:02:10

14) (move-a-left-middle) — Move disk A from left to middle.
    Time: 00:02:10 → 00:02:20

15) (move-b-left-right) — Move disk B from left to right.
    Time: 00:02:20 → 00:02:30

16) (move-a-middle-right) — Move disk A from middle to right.
    Time: 00:02:30 → 00:02:40

Outcome:
- Total moves: 16 (unit cost = 16).
- Total elapsed time (assuming 10s per move): 00:02:40.
- Final configuration achieved: right peg (top→bottom) A, B, C, D; left and middle pegs empty.
