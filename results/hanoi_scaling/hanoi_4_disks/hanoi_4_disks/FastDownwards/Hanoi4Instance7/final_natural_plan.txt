Summary: executing the given plan (17 moves, cost = 17). Each step below lists the PDDL action (exactly as in the plan), a concise human-readable description of the move (disk labels A,B,C,D correspond to PDDL a,b,c,d; pegs: left, middle, right), a timestamp, and a per-move duration (uniform 10s). Total execution time: 170s. Final state goal: all disks A (top), B, C, D (bottom) on the right peg.

1) 00:00:00 — 00:00:10
   (move-with-below-to-empty a b left middle)
   Move disk A (smallest) from left to middle. Disk B was immediately below A on left; middle was empty.

2) 00:00:10 — 00:00:20
   (move-with-below-to-empty b c left right)
   Move disk B from left to right. Disk C was immediately below B on left; right was empty.

3) 00:00:20 — 00:00:30
   (move-only-to-nonempty a middle right b)
   Move disk A from middle to right and place it on top of disk B (A < B). Middle becomes empty.

4) 00:00:30 — 00:00:40
   (move-with-below-to-empty c d left middle)
   Move disk C from left to middle. Disk D was immediately below C on left; middle was empty.

5) 00:00:40 — 00:00:50
   (move-with-below-to-nonempty a b right left d)
   Move disk A from right to left, where disk D is currently the top of the destination peg (left). A is placed on left on top of D (A < D). Note: parameters indicate A had B below on its source.

6) 00:00:50 — 00:01:00
   (move-only-to-nonempty b right middle c)
   Move disk B from right to middle and place it on top of disk C (B < C). Right becomes empty of B; B goes on middle.

7) 00:01:00 — 00:01:10
   (move-with-below-to-nonempty a d left middle b)
   Move disk A from left to middle and place it on top of disk B (A < B). A was above disk D on left originally; destination middle is non-empty with B as top.

8) 00:01:10 — 00:01:20
   (move-only-to-empty d left right)
   Move disk D (largest) from left to right. D was the only disk on left at this moment (bottom and top); right is empty, so D becomes bottom/top at right.

9) 00:01:20 — 00:01:30
   (move-with-below-to-empty a b middle left)
   Move disk A from middle back to left. Disk B was immediately below A on middle; left was empty at this moment.

10) 00:01:30 — 00:01:40
    (move-with-below-to-nonempty b c middle right d)
    Move disk B from middle to right and place it on top of disk D (B < D). B had C below on its source middle.

11) 00:01:40 — 00:01:50
    (move-only-to-nonempty a left middle c)
    Move disk A from left to middle and place it on top of disk C (A < C). Left becomes empty of A.

12) 00:01:50 — 00:02:00
    (move-with-below-to-empty b d right left)
    Move disk B from right to left. Disk D was immediately below B at the right; destination left is empty.

13) 00:02:00 — 00:02:10
    (move-with-below-to-nonempty a c middle left b)
    Move disk A from middle to left and place it on top of disk B (A < B). A had C below on its source middle.

14) 00:02:10 — 00:02:20
    (move-only-to-nonempty c middle right d)
    Move disk C from middle to right and place it on top of disk D (C < D). Middle becomes empty of C.

15) 00:02:20 — 00:02:30
    (move-with-below-to-empty a b left middle)
    Move disk A from left to middle. Disk B was immediately below A on left; middle was empty.

16) 00:02:30 — 00:02:40
    (move-only-to-nonempty b left right c)
    Move disk B from left to right and place it on top of disk C (B < C). Left becomes empty of B.

17) 00:02:40 — 00:02:50
    (move-only-to-nonempty a middle right b)
    Move disk A from middle to right and place it on top of disk B (A < B). Middle becomes empty.

Execution complete at 00:02:50 (total duration 170s). Cost reported by plan: 17. Final (goal) configuration: right peg has top-to-bottom A, B, C, D; left and middle are empty. All moves respect the move legality rules (move one top disk at a time; never place larger on smaller).
