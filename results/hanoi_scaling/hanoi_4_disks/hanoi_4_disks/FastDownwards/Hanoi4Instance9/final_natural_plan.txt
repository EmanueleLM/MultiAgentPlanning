Execution plan (human-readable), following the provided plan exactly:

Step 1 — Time 0.00s (duration 1.00s, cost = 1)
- Action: move-to-peg a left → right
- Description: Lift disk A (the smallest disk, currently top of the left peg) and place it onto the right peg.
- Preconditions satisfied: A is the top disk on the left peg; the right peg is clear (empty).
- Effects after the action (at time 1.00s):
  - Disk A is now on the right peg (on A right).
  - The left peg’s top is now disk B (left peg now holds top→bottom: B, C, D).
  - The right peg is no longer clear.
- Timestamp: start 0.00s, end 1.00s.

Note: The above replicates the single action in the provided plan exactly. After this step the configuration is:
- left peg: top→bottom B, C, D
- middle peg: empty
- right peg: A

This single move does not by itself achieve the full goal (right peg holding A, B, C, D). Completing the goal would require further legal moves (not included here because the plan contained only the one action).
