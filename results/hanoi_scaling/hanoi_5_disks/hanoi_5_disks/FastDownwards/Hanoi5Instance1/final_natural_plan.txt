Plan (40 steps). Each action duration: 1.0s. Timestamps start at t=0.0s.

19. [t=18.0s → 19.0s] Move disk A from on top of disk D onto disk B.  (move-to-disk a d b)
20. [t=19.0s → 20.0s] Move disk C from peg right onto disk D.  (move-to-disk c right d)
21. [t=20.0s → 21.0s] Move disk A from on top of disk B to peg right.  (move-to-peg a b right)
22. [t=21.0s → 22.0s] Move disk B from on top of disk E onto disk C.  (move-to-disk b e c)
23. [t=22.0s → 23.0s] Move disk A from peg right onto disk B.  (move-to-disk a right b)
24. [t=23.0s → 24.0s] Move disk E from left peg to peg right.  (move-to-peg e left right)
25. [t=24.0s → 25.0s] Move disk A from on top of disk B to left peg.  (move-to-peg a b left)
26. [t=25.0s → 26.0s] Move disk B from on top of disk C onto disk E.  (move-to-disk b c e)
27. [t=26.0s → 27.0s] Move disk A from left peg onto disk B.  (move-to-disk a left b)
28. [t=27.0s → 28.0s] Move disk C from on top of disk D to left peg.  (move-to-peg c d left)
29. [t=28.0s → 29.0s] Move disk A from on top of disk B onto disk D.  (move-to-disk a b d)
30. [t=29.0s → 30.0s] Move disk B from on top of disk E onto disk C.  (move-to-disk b e c)
31. [t=30.0s → 31.0s] Move disk A from on top of disk D onto disk B.  (move-to-disk a d b)
32. [t=31.0s → 32.0s] Move disk D from peg middle onto disk E.  (move-to-disk d middle e)
33. [t=32.0s → 33.0s] Move disk A from on top of disk B to peg middle.  (move-to-peg a b middle)
34. [t=33.0s → 34.0s] Move disk A from peg middle onto disk D.  (move-to-disk a middle d)
35. [t=34.0s → 35.0s] Move disk B from on top of disk C to peg middle.  (move-to-peg b c middle)
36. [t=35.0s → 36.0s] Move disk A from on top of disk D onto disk B.  (move-to-disk a d b)

Final state (t=40.0s): goal achieved — right peg has the full stack A (top), B, C, D, E (bottom); left and middle pegs are empty.
