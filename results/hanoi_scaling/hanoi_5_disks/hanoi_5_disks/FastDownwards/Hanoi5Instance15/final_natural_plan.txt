Summary: 32 ordered moves (cost = 32). Each step below is the exact action from the plan, translated to plain English. I use uppercase disk names (A–E) and peg names (left, middle, right). Each move is listed with a start time (t = 0,1,2, ...) and a duration of 1 time unit.

1. t=0 → t=1 (move-to-peg a b right)
   - Move disk A from on top of disk B to the right peg.

2. t=1 → t=2 (move-to-peg b c middle)
   - Move disk B from on top of disk C to the middle peg.

3. t=2 → t=3 (move-to-disk a right b)
   - Move disk A from the right peg to rest on top of disk B.

4. t=3 → t=4 (move-to-peg c d right)
   - Move disk C from on top of disk D to the right peg.

5. t=4 → t=5 (move-to-disk a b d)
   - Move disk A from on top of disk B to rest on top of disk D.

6. t=5 → t=6 (move-to-disk b middle c)
   - Move disk B from the middle peg to rest on top of disk C.

7. t=6 → t=7 (move-to-disk a d b)
   - Move disk A from on top of disk D to rest on top of disk B.

8. t=7 → t=8 (move-to-peg d e middle)
   - Move disk D from on top of disk E to the middle peg.

9. t=8 → t=9 (move-to-disk a b e)
   - Move disk A from on top of disk B to rest on top of disk E.

10. t=9 → t=10 (move-to-disk a e d)
    - Move disk A from on top of disk E to rest on top of disk D.

11. t=10 → t=11 (move-to-disk b c e)
    - Move disk B from on top of disk C to rest on top of disk E.

12. t=11 → t=12 (move-to-disk a d b)
    - Move disk A from on top of disk D to rest on top of disk B.

13. t=12 → t=13 (move-to-disk c right d)
    - Move disk C from the right peg to rest on top of disk D.

14. t=13 → t=14 (move-to-peg a b right)
    - Move disk A from on top of disk B to the right peg.

15. t=14 → t=15 (move-to-disk b e c)
    - Move disk B from on top of disk E to rest on top of disk C.

16. t=15 → t=16 (move-to-disk a right b)
    - Move disk A from the right peg to rest on top of disk B.

17. t=16 → t=17 (move-to-peg e left right)
    - Move disk E from the left peg to the right peg.

18. t=17 → t=18 (move-to-peg a b left)
    - Move disk A from on top of disk B to the left peg.

19. t=18 → t=19 (move-to-disk b c e)
    - Move disk B from on top of disk C to rest on top of disk E.

20. t=19 → t=20 (move-to-disk a left b)
    - Move disk A from the left peg to rest on top of disk B.

21. t=20 → t=21 (move-to-peg c d left)
    - Move disk C from on top of disk D to the left peg.

22. t=21 → t=22 (move-to-disk a b d)
    - Move disk A from on top of disk B to rest on top of disk D.

23. t=22 → t=23 (move-to-disk b e c)
    - Move disk B from on top of disk E to rest on top of disk C.

24. t=23 → t=24 (move-to-disk a d b)
    - Move disk A from on top of disk D to rest on top of disk B.

25. t=24 → t=25 (move-to-disk d middle e)
    - Move disk D from the middle peg to rest on top of disk E.

26. t=25 → t=26 (move-to-disk a b d)
    - Move disk A from on top of disk B to rest on top of disk D.

27. t=26 → t=27 (move-to-peg b c middle)
    - Move disk B from on top of disk C to the middle peg.

28. t=27 → t=28 (move-to-disk a d b)
    - Move disk A from on top of disk D to rest on top of disk B.

29. t=28 → t=29 (move-to-disk c left d)
    - Move disk C from the left peg to rest on top of disk D.

30. t=29 → t=30 (move-to-peg a b left)
    - Move disk A from on top of disk B to the left peg.

31. t=30 → t=31 (move-to-disk b middle c)
    - Move disk B from the middle peg to rest on top of disk C.

32. t=31 → t=32 (move-to-disk a left b)
    - Move disk A from the left peg to rest on top of disk B.

Final state at t=32: the complete stack has been moved to the right peg in proper order (top A down to E), matching the goal. Total cost (moves): 32.
