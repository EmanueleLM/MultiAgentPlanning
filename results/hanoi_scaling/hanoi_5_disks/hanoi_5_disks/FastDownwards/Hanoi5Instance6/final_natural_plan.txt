Assuming each move takes 1s, starting at t=0.0s. Steps follow the given plan exactly (32 moves, cost = 32).

1) [t=0.0s → 1.0s] Move disk A from on top of disk B to peg right.
2) [t=1.0s → 2.0s] Move disk B from on top of disk C to peg middle.
3) [t=2.0s → 3.0s] Move disk A from peg right to on top of disk B.
4) [t=3.0s → 4.0s] Move disk C from on top of disk D to peg right.
5) [t=4.0s → 5.0s] Move disk A from on top of disk B to on top of disk D.
6) [t=5.0s → 6.0s] Move disk B from peg middle to on top of disk C.
7) [t=6.0s → 7.0s] Move disk A from on top of disk D to on top of disk B.
8) [t=7.0s → 8.0s] Move disk D from on top of disk E to peg middle.
9) [t=8.0s → 9.0s] Move disk A from on top of disk B to on top of disk E.
10) [t=9.0s →10.0s] Move disk A from on top of disk E to on top of disk D.
11) [t=10.0s→11.0s] Move disk B from on top of disk C to on top of disk E.
12) [t=11.0s→12.0s] Move disk A from on top of disk D to on top of disk B.
13) [t=12.0s→13.0s] Move disk C from peg right to on top of disk D.
14) [t=13.0s→14.0s] Move disk A from on top of disk B to peg right.
15) [t=14.0s→15.0s] Move disk B from on top of disk E to on top of disk C.
16) [t=15.0s→16.0s] Move disk A from peg right to on top of disk B.
17) [t=16.0s→17.0s] Move disk E from peg left to peg right.
18) [t=17.0s→18.0s] Move disk A from on top of disk B to peg left.
19) [t=18.0s→19.0s] Move disk B from on top of disk C to on top of disk E.
20) [t=19.0s→20.0s] Move disk A from peg left to on top of disk B.
21) [t=20.0s→21.0s] Move disk C from on top of disk D to peg left.
22) [t=21.0s→22.0s] Move disk A from on top of disk B to on top of disk D.
23) [t=22.0s→23.0s] Move disk B from on top of disk E to on top of disk C.
24) [t=23.0s→24.0s] Move disk A from on top of disk D to on top of disk B.
25) [t=24.0s→25.0s] Move disk D from peg middle to on top of disk E.
26) [t=25.0s→26.0s] Move disk A from on top of disk B to on top of disk D.
27) [t=26.0s→27.0s] Move disk B from on top of disk C to peg middle.
28) [t=27.0s→28.0s] Move disk A from on top of disk D to on top of disk B.
29) [t=28.0s→29.0s] Move disk C from peg left to on top of disk D.
30) [t=29.0s→30.0s] Move disk A from on top of disk B to peg left.
31) [t=30.0s→31.0s] Move disk B from peg middle to on top of disk C.
32) [t=31.0s→32.0s] Move disk A from peg left to on top of disk B.

Plan complete: 32 moves (cost = 32). Final state: all disks E (bottom), D, C, B, A (top) stacked on peg right as required.
