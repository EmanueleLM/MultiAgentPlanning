PROBLEM
------------------------------
Solve a Tower of Hanoi puzzle using three pegs named left, middle, and right. There are 6 disks labelled A, B, C, D, E, F from smallest (A) to largest (F). Move one disk at a time and never place a larger disk on top of a smaller one. Initially, left peg has (top→bottom) A, B, C, D, E, F; middle peg is empty; right peg is empty. The goal configuration is: left peg is empty; middle peg is empty; right peg has (top→bottom) A, B, C, D, E, F.
