PROBLEM
------------------------------
Solve a Tower of Hanoi puzzle using three pegs named left, middle, and right. There are 6 disks labelled A, B, C, D, E, F from smallest (A) to largest (F). Move one disk at a time and never place a larger disk on top of a smaller one. Initially, left peg has (top→bottom) A, B, C, D, E, F; middle peg is empty; right peg is empty. The goal configuration is: left peg is empty; middle peg is empty; right peg has (top→bottom) A, B, C, D, E, F.

PROBLEM
------------------------------
Solve a Tower of Hanoi puzzle using three pegs named left, middle, and right. There are 6 disks labelled A, B, C, D, E, F from smallest (A) to largest (F). Move one disk at a time and never place a larger disk on top of a smaller one. Initially, left peg has (top→bottom) A, B, C, D, E, F; middle peg is empty; right peg is empty. The goal configuration is: left peg is empty; middle peg is empty; right peg has (top→bottom) A, B, C, D, E, F.

NATURAL-PLAN sas_plan_2
------------------------------
Below is a direct, human-readable rendering of each action in the provided plan. Each step is listed in order, with a start timestamp (assuming each action takes 1s) and a short duration. Disk names are uppercase (A–F) and pegs are left / middle / right. “From on X” means the disk was sitting on X (X may be a disk or a peg). I do not add or remove any actions — they match the plan exactly.

68. t=67s (dur=1s): Move disk B from on top of disk C to peg left.
69. t=68s (dur=1s): Move disk A from on top of disk D onto disk B.
70. t=69s (dur=1s): Move disk C from peg middle onto disk D.
71. t=70s (dur=1s): Move disk A from on top of disk B to peg middle.
72. t=71s (dur=1s): Move disk B from peg left onto disk C.
73. t=72s (dur=1s): Move disk A from peg middle onto disk B.

Final time: t=73s (after the last action completes).
Result: All 6 disks have been moved according to the plan; the final configuration (goal) is achieved at t=73s: right peg holds disks A (top), B, C, D, E, F (bottom), with left and middle pegs empty.
