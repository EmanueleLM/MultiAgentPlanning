Below is a direct, human-readable rendering of each action in the provided plan. Each step is listed in order, with a start timestamp (assuming each action takes 1s) and a short duration. Disk names are uppercase (A–F) and pegs are left / middle / right. “From on X” means the disk was sitting on X (X may be a disk or a peg). I do not add or remove any actions — they match the plan exactly.
