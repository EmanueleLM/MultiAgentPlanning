Below is a step-by-step, human-readable sequence of the 73 moves in the provided plan. Each line corresponds exactly to one action in the plan (no moves added or removed). I give a simple 1-second timestamp for each move (step N occurs from t = N-1s to t = N s).

Notes and clarifications:
- Disk names are A (smallest) through F (largest); peg names are left, middle, right. Each numbered step corresponds exactly to the action at the same position in the original plan.
- Each step states the disk moved, its immediate origin relation (either “on top of disk X” or “from peg Y”), and the destination (peg or “onto disk X”).
- I assigned a unit duration (1 second) per move to provide timestamps; the solver output did not include explicit timestamps, so these are simple, consistent placeholders that preserve relative ordering and satisfy the “report a timestamp/duration when possible” requirement.
