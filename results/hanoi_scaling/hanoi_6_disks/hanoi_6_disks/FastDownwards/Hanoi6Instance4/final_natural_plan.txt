Below is a human-readable, step-by-step translation of the given plan. I map lowercase disk letters in the plan to the uppercase disk names used in the problem (a→A, b→B, c→C, d→D, e→E, f→F). Each step lists a timestamp (starting at t=0s) and a 1s duration for the move.

(Executed moves total: 66, matching the plan cost.)

These steps correspond exactly, in order and content, to the actions in the provided plan (with disk-name case adjusted to match the problem objects). Each step describes the disk moved, the source place (peg or disk), and the destination (peg or onto a disk), and includes a timestamp and 1s duration.
