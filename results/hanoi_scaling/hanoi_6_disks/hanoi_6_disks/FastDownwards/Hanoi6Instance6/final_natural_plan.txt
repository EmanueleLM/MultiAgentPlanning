Below is a step-by-step, human-readable execution of the given plan. I number each move and give a simple timestamp assuming 1 second per move (t=0s for step 1, t=1s for step 2, etc.). Disks are listed by letter (A = smallest, F = largest). Each line follows the plan exactly (no additions or deletions).

2. [t=1s] Move disk B from on top of disk C to peg right.
