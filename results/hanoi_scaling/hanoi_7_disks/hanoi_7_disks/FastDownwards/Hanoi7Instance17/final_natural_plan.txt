Summary: The following is the exact sequence of 135 moves from the provided plan. Each step is listed in order, with a simple timestamp assuming each move takes 1 second (start time t=0s). Disk names are A..G and pegs are Left, Middle, Right. Wording: "from on top of disk X" means the disk was directly on disk X; "from peg X" means the disk was directly on that peg; "onto disk X" means the disk is placed directly on disk X; "to peg X" means placed on that peg.
