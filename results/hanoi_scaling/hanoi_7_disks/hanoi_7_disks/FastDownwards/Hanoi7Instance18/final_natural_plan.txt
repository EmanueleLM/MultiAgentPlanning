Total moves: 194 (total elapsed time ≈ 194 seconds with the per-move durations above).
Final state (after completing the above moves): all disks A (top) through G (bottom) are assembled in order on peg right, achieving the specified goal.

Notes:
- Each step directly corresponds to one plan action in the provided plan (action type and parameters preserved).
- Timestamps were assigned incrementally at 1-second intervals to show order and duration; these are illustrative/symbolic timestamps that satisfy the request to report time information whenever possible.
