Below is a step-by-step, human-readable transcription of the provided PDDL plan. Each line corresponds exactly to one action in the plan, in the same order. Disk names are shown in uppercase (A..G) to match the problem statement; pegs are left, middle, right. A timestamp is given for each step, assuming a uniform estimated duration of 10 seconds per move (timestamp shows when the move starts).

Note: Each step is a single legal Tower-of-Hanoi move: one disk moved, no larger disk placed on a smaller disk. The timestamps are estimated assuming 10 seconds per move; adjust durations if you have a different robot timing.
