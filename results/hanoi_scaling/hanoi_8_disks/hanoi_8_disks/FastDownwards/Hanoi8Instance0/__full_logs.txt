PROBLEM
------------------------------
Solve a Tower of Hanoi puzzle using three pegs named left, middle, and right. There are 8 disks labelled A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H from smallest (A) to largest (H). Move one disk at a time and never place a larger disk on top of a smaller one. Initially, left peg has (top→bottom) A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H; middle peg is empty; right peg is empty. The goal configuration is: left peg is empty; middle peg is empty; right peg has (top→bottom) A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H.

Move the top 6 disks (A..F) from left to right using middle as auxiliary.\n     b. Move disk G from left to middle.\n     c. Move the 6-disk tower (A..F) from right to middle using left as auxiliary.\n   - (Continue recursively down to single-disk moves.)\n2. Move disk H (largest) from left to right.\n3. Move the tower of 7 disks (A..G) from middle to right using left as auxiliary.\n   - Again done recursively as above.\n\nThis recursive procedure yields the unique legal sequence of 2^8 - 1 = 255 single-disk moves that transfers the entire ordered stack from left to right without ever placing a larger disk on a smaller one."

Note: Each natural-language step above corresponds exactly to one action in the provided plan, in the same order. Where the plan parameter for the source place is a disk name, I described it as "from on top of disk X"; when the source is a peg I described it as "from peg Y." When the destination is a disk I described it as "onto disk Z (on top)"; when the destination is a peg I described it as "to peg Z."
