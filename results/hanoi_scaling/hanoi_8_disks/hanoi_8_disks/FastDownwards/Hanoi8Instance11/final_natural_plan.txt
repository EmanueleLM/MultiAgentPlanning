Note: Each line corresponds to one move in the provided plan. Each move is performed by the pegged controller indicated by the action prefix (left_peg / middle_peg / right_peg). The description uses the current support (the object named as the second parameter in the plan) and, for onto-disk moves, names the target disk explicitly. The sequence conforms to the Tower of Hanoi rules: one disk moved at a time and never placing a larger disk on a smaller disk. The plan as translated reaches the goal of moving the full stack A..H from left to right in the preserved order.
