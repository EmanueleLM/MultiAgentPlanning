Step 1 — Action (from plan): (move-to-peg a left right)
- Human-readable: Move disk A (the smallest disk, top of the left peg) from the left peg to the right peg.
- Preconditions satisfied at start: A is on left; A is the top/clear disk on the left; the right peg is clear/empty.
- Timestamp / duration: start t = 0.0, end t = 1.0 (duration = 1 time unit; action cost = 1).
- Effects (resulting state summary): 
  - Disk A is now on the right peg (A is top on right).
  - The right peg is no longer clear (it has A).
  - The left peg’s new top disk is B (the next-smallest); the left peg is no longer holding A on top.
  - Middle peg remains empty.

No other actions. Final (achieved) state after this single step: A has been moved from left to right.
