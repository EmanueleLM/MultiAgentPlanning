Below is a step-by-step, human-readable trace of the exact plan provided. Each line shows the original PDDL action (in parentheses), a concise natural-language description of the move, a timestamp (assuming 1 second per atomic action), and a per-step duration of 1s. Steps are listed in the same order and with the same parameters as in the plan; nothing is added or removed.

End of plan. Final timestamp: 00:04:38. Total atomic steps: 279. Total nominal duration (1s per step): 279 seconds.

Notes:
- Each natural-language step corresponds exactly (in order and parameters) to the PDDL action shown in parentheses.
- I assumed a constant atomic action duration of 1 second to provide timestamps; this preserves order and offers a simple, consistent timeline. If you prefer a different per-action duration, I can re-stamp accordingly.
