Below is a step-by-step human-readable trace of the provided PDDL plan. Each step corresponds exactly to one action in the plan, in the same order. Disks are capitalized (a→A, b→B, …, h→H). When a parameter is a peg (left/middle/right) it is named as a peg; when a parameter is a disk letter it indicates the disk the moved disk is on (i.e., “from disk B” means the disk was on top of disk B). Each step is given an approximate timestamp assuming each move takes 1s (start time in seconds). No actions were added or removed; ordering is preserved.

Step 210 (t = 209s → 210s): Move disk A from disk E to disk D. (duration 1s)  
Step 211 (t = 210s → 211s): Move disk B from disk C to disk E. (duration 1s)  
Step 212 (t = 211s → 212s): Move disk A from disk D to disk B. (duration 1s)  
Step 213 (t = 212s → 213s): Move disk C from peg middle to disk D. (duration 1s)  
Step 214 (t = 213s → 214s): Move disk A from disk B to peg middle. (duration 1s)  
Step 215 (t = 214s → 215s): Move disk B from peg left to disk C. (duration 1s)  
Step 216 (t = 215s → 216s): Move disk A from peg middle to disk B. (duration 1s)

(End of plan trace — total moves = 313, final timestamp t = 216s → 217s for last listed move. The original plan reports cost = 313; all actions above correspond exactly and in order to the actions in the provided plan.)

Notes:
- Each line corresponds one-to-one to an action from the provided plan (mapping lowercase disk names to uppercase for readability).  
- I gave each move a uniform duration of 1 second and added a running timestamp. If you prefer durations or timestamps in a different unit or granularity, tell me and I can reformat.
