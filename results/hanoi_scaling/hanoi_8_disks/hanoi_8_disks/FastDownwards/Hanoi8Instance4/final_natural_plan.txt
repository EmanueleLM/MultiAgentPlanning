Below is a step-by-step, human-readable enactment of the provided plan. Each step is numbered, timestamped (assuming each move takes 1 second), and describes the exact move from the plan. Disk names are uppercase (A..H). Peg names are Capitalized (Left, Middle, Right). When the source is a disk I describe it as “on disk X”; when the source is a peg I describe it as “from peg X”. When the destination is a disk I indicate “onto disk X”; when the destination is a peg I indicate “onto peg X”.

Step 252 — t=252s (duration 1s): Move disk A from on disk D onto disk B.  
Step 253 — t=253s (duration 1s): Move disk C from on disk H onto disk D.  
Step 254 — t=254s (duration 1s): Move disk A from on disk B onto disk C.  
Step 255 — t=255s (duration 1s): Move disk A from on disk C onto disk H.  
Step 256 — t=256s (duration 1s): Move disk B from on disk D onto disk C.  
Step 257 — t=257s (duration 1s): Move disk A from on disk H onto disk B.  
Step 258 — t=258s (duration 1s): Move disk G from peg Middle onto disk H.  
Step 259 — t=259s (duration 1s): Move disk A from on disk B onto disk G.  
Step 260 — t=260s (duration 1s): Move disk A from on disk G onto disk B.  
Step 261 — t=261s (duration 1s): Move disk A from on disk B onto disk C.  
Step 262 — t=262s (duration 1s): Move disk B from peg Middle onto disk G.  
Step 263 — t=263s (duration 1s): Move disk A from on disk C onto disk B.  
Step 264 — t=264s (duration 1s): Move disk A from on disk B onto peg Middle.  
Step 265 — t=265s (duration 1s): Move disk B from on disk Left onto disk C.  
Step 266 — t=266s (duration 1s): Move disk A from peg Middle onto disk B.

Final state reached at t=266s (after 266 moves): the sequence followed exactly matches the provided plan through the final listed move. The plan provided had "cost = 320 (unit cost)", but the explicit move-list above contains 266 numbered moves as listed in the plan block. Each step above corresponds exactly, in order and labels, to the steps in the plan.

If you want the same list in a condensed format (no timestamps) or starting timestamp different or different per-move durations, tell me and I will adjust.
