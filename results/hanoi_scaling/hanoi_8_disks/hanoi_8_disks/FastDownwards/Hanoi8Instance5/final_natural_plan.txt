Below is a step-by-step, human-readable transcription of the provided PDDL plan. Each step corresponds exactly to one action in the plan (no actions added or removed). For clarity I list a step number, a timestamp (assuming each move takes 1 time unit), and a concise natural-language description of the move. Disk labels are shown uppercase (A..H) to match the problem statement; peg names are left/middle/right.

End state after step 287: goal achieved — the full stack (top->bottom A,B,C,D,E,F,G,H) resides on the right peg, with left and middle empty, matching the specified goal.

Notes:
- Each step corresponds exactly to one action in the provided plan. No steps were added or removed.
- Timestamps are given as integer time units assuming 1 unit per move; durations are listed as 1 for each move for readability.
- Phrasing indicates where the disk was (on another disk or on a peg) and where it is moved (onto a peg or onto a specific disk).
