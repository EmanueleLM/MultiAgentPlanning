Summary: Each step below is one atomic move of a single disk. Estimated duration per move: 1s. Timestamp for Step 1 is t=0s; Step N occurs at t=(N-1)s. Disk letters are capitalized to match the problem (A is smallest, H largest). Peg names are left, middle, right. For moves that reference a “below” disk, that is the disk the moved disk was sitting on before the move. For moves that reference a destination top disk, that is the disk the moved disk is placed onto.

End state: after step 294 (t=293s) the plan reaches the goal configuration (the full stack A..H reconstructed on the right peg in order A (top) to H (bottom)) as specified.

Notes and assumptions:
- Each step respects the single-disk atomic move constraint and the “never place larger disk on smaller disk” constraint; the step descriptions note the disk moved, its source peg, its destination peg, and whether the destination peg was empty or which disk became the support.
- Estimated duration is given as 1 second per move for timestamping purposes only. If you prefer a different time unit or no timestamps, I can produce that variant.
