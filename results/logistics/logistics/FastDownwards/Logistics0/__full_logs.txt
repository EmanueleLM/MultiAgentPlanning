FINAL-PLAN
------------------------------
I don't yet have the individual agents' structured action models or the initial state facts needed to build the combined PDDL domain + problem. Please provide the structured inputs from each agent (paltry_agent, sip_agent, clip_agent, wretched_agent, memory_agent, tightfisted_agent) and the initial statements. I will then reconcile names, preserve each agent's action names, encode constraints as hard constraints, and produce a FastDownwards-compatible domain and problem with the goal:
next object_8 object_6

To make this fast and unambiguous, please give each agent's model in the following template (repeat for each agent):

Agent: paltry_agent
Predicates used:
- (predicate-name ?params...)  ; list all predicate signatures this agent uses

Actions:
- action-name
  parameters: (?p1 - type1 ?p2 - type2 ...)
  preconditions:
  - (pred1 ?args)
  - (not (pred2 ?args))
  add-effects:
  - (pred3 ?args)
  del-effects:
  - (pred4 ?args)

(Repeat for each action the agent provides)

Objects (global list you want in the problem):
- object_1 - typeX
- object_2 - typeX
... (must include object_6 and object_8)

Initial facts (I will treat all "would rather / prefer / avoid" as hard constraints unless you tell me otherwise):
- (pred ?args)
- (not (pred ?args))   ; explicit negations if needed
- (available-slot slot1)  ; any facts relevant to timing/availability

Timing / temporal constraints (if any):
- e.g., "action A must be before action B" or "slot S unavailable at times 3-5" — provide as facts or explicit constraints.

Notes on naming conflicts or synonyms (optional but helpful):
- e.g., "paltry_agent uses (at ?x ?y) while memory_agent uses (located ?x ?y) — treat as the same predicate 'at'." If you do not specify, I'll resolve by renaming and documenting choices in PDDL comments.

Additional requirements:
- If any actions are durative / require numeric time, say so. Otherwise I will produce a STRIPS-style domain (:requirements :strips :typing :negative-preconditions) compatible with FastDownwards.
- If any predicate should be typed, give types; otherwise I'll use a minimal typing scheme (e.g., object, location, slot, agent).

Once you provide these items, I'll produce:
- A single PDDL domain enclosed in <domain>...</domain> including all predicates, types, and each agent's actions (with names prefixed or otherwise kept distinct).
- A single PDDL problem enclosed in <problem>...</problem> with objects, initial state, and the goal (next object_8 object_6).
- Inline comments in the PDDL (where supported by the format) documenting any naming resolutions or decisions I make.

If you prefer, you can paste the agents' structured models directly and I will proceed.
