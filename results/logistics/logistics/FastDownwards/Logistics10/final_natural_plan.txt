Summary: No actions are required. The initial state already satisfies every goal predicate, so the plan is empty (0 actions).

Plan (0 steps)
- Timestamp 0.0, duration 0.0 — No-op: start state already meets the goal; no actions executed.

Verification (each goal fact is present in the initial state)
- Goal: (next object_0 object_8) — present in init.
- Goal: (next object_0 object_5) — present in init.
- Goal: (next object_1 object_6) — present in init.
- Goal: (next object_3 object_5) — present in init.
- Goal: (next object_4 object_6) — present in init.
- Goal: (next object_4 object_7) — present in init.
- Goal: (next object_5 object_8) — present in init.
- Goal: (next object_9 object_5) — present in init.
- Goal: (next object_10 object_6) — present in init.
- Goal: (next object_10 object_8) — present in init.
- Goal: (next object_11 object_9) — present in init.
- Goal: (next object_11 object_6) — present in init.

Conclusion: The provided PDDL plan is empty and correct — no actions are needed because the initial state already satisfies the global goal.
