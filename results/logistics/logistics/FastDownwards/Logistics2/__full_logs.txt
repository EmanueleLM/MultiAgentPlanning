FINAL-PLAN
------------------------------
I don't yet have the individual agents' structured action models or the initial state facts needed to build the combined PDDL domain + problem. Please provide the structured inputs from each agent (paltry_agent, sip_agent, clip_agent, wretched_agent, memory_agent, tightfisted_agent) and the initial statements. I will then reconcile names, preserve each agent's action names, encode constraints as hard constraints, and produce a FastDownwards-compatible domain and problem with the goal:
next object_8 object_6

To make this fast and unambiguous, please give each agent's model in the following template (repeat for each agent):

Agent: paltry_agent
Predicates used:
- (predicate-name ?params...)  ; list all predicate signatures this agent uses

Actions:
- action-name
  parameters: (?p1 - type1 ?p2 - type2 ...)
  preconditions:
  - (pred1 ?args)
  - (not (pred2 ?args))
  add-effects:
  - (pred3 ?args)
  del-effects:
  - (pred4 ?args)

(Repeat for each action the agent provides)

Objects (global list you want in the problem):
- object_1 - typeX
- object_2 - typeX
... (must include object_6 and object_8)

Initial facts (I will treat all "would rather / prefer / avoid" as hard constraints unless you tell me otherwise):
- (pred ?args)
- (not (pred ?args))   ; explicit negations if needed
- (available-slot slot1)  ; any facts relevant to timing/availability

Timing / temporal constraints (if any):
- e.g., "action A must be before action B" or "slot S unavailable at times 3-5" — provide as facts or explicit constraints.

Notes on naming conflicts or synonyms (optional but helpful):
- e.g., "paltry_agent uses (at ?x ?y) while memory_agent uses (located ?x ?y) — treat as the same predicate 'at'." If you do not specify, I'll resolve by renaming and documenting choices in PDDL comments.

Additional requirements:
- If any actions are durative / require numeric time, say so. Otherwise I will produce a STRIPS-style domain (:requirements :strips :typing :negative-preconditions) compatible with FastDownwards.
- If any predicate should be typed, give types; otherwise I'll use a minimal typing scheme (e.g., object, location, slot, agent).

Once you provide these items, I'll produce:
- A single PDDL domain enclosed in <domain>...</domain> including all predicates, types, and each agent's actions (with names prefixed or otherwise kept distinct).
- A single PDDL problem enclosed in <problem>...</problem> with objects, initial state, and the goal (next object_8 object_6).
- Inline comments in the PDDL (where supported by the format) documenting any naming resolutions or decisions I make.

If you prefer, you can paste the agents' structured models directly and I will proceed.

FINAL-PLAN
------------------------------
I don’t yet have the structured outputs from planner1 and planner2 you referenced. To produce an accurate, integrated PDDL domain and problem that respect the planners’ discovered preconditions/effects, object sets, initial facts, and goals, I need those planner analyses (the structured summaries).

Please either:
- Paste the structured outputs from planner1 and planner2 (their object lists, predicates, actions with preconditions/effects, initial facts, and goals), or
- Tell me I should proceed by making a best-effort (assumption-based) integration for the six named actions (paltry, sip, clip, wretched, memory, tightfisted). If you choose this, I will state all assumptions I make and produce PDDL accordingly.

If you want me to assume and generate now, useful clarifying details to supply or confirm:
- Agent names (one or many) and whether actions are agent-specific (e.g., paltry_by_agent1 vs paltry_by_agent2) or shared.
- The domain objects and types (e.g., items, cups, clips, memories, slots, resources, locations).
- Which goals from planner1 and planner2 must both be satisfied (list them).
- Any hard temporal constraints (e.g., orderings, earliest times, unavailable slots) that should be encoded as strict constraints.
- Any predicates the planners used (e.g., at, has, clipped, remembered, tight, free-slot).

If you want me to proceed with a reasonable default integration, say “Proceed with assumptions” and I will: 
- Define types agent, item, cup, clip, memory, slot.
- Create predicates and actions named exactly paltry, sip, clip, wretched, memory, tightfisted, keeping separate agent parameters where relevant.
- Produce a FastDownward-compatible classical PDDL domain and a problem using a combined hypothetical object set and combined goals, and list all assumptions at top of the output.

NATURAL-PLAN sas_plan_3
------------------------------
Summary: No actions are needed — the initial state already satisfies the goal.

Plan (0 actions)
- Total cost: 0, total duration: 0.00s

Initial facts that satisfy the goal:
- next object_7 object_6
- next object_8 object_6

Timeline:
- t = 0.00s: No action executed. Goal already satisfied.

Result: Goal achieved (next object_7 object_6 and next object_8 object_6).
