Summary: The following sequence of 5 agent actions (each by playerA) follows the provided plan exactly. I list for each step: a timestamp (1..5), the action with its arguments and roles, the required preconditions (and whether satisfied at that time), the immediate effects (facts added and deleted), and the relevant state change. Each action is assumed to take 1 time unit (total cost = 5).

1) t = 1 — playerA-wretched(sneeze=object_5, texture_from=object_9, texture_to=object_11, stupendous=object_3)
- Preconditions (checked before step): 
  - (sneeze object_5) — satisfied
  - (texture object_9) — satisfied
  - (texture object_11) — satisfied
  - (stupendous object_3) — satisfied
  - (next object_5 object_9) — satisfied
  - (collect object_9 object_3) — satisfied
  - (collect object_11 object_3) — satisfied
- Effects:
  - Add: (next object_5 object_11)
  - Delete: (next object_5 object_9)
- State change: object_5's "next" link is moved from object_9 to object_11.

2) t = 2 — playerA-clip(hand=object_12, sneeze=object_5, texture=object_10, next_s_to=object_11, next_h_from=object_10)
(mapping: :parameters ?h=object_12, ?s=object_5, ?t=object_10, ?ny=object_11, ?nx=object_10)
- Preconditions (checked before step): 
  - (hand object_12) — satisfied
  - (sneeze object_5) — satisfied
  - (texture object_10) — satisfied
  - (next object_5 object_11) — satisfied (created by step 1)
  - (next object_12 object_10) — satisfied (initial fact)
- Effects:
  - Add: (vase object_12 object_5)
  - Delete: (next object_12 object_10)
- State change: object_12 loses its "next" link to object_10; a vase relation between object_12 and object_5 is created.

3) t = 3 — playerA-tightfisted(hand=object_12, sneeze=object_5, texture=object_10, next_target=object_11)
- Preconditions (checked before step): 
  - (hand object_12) — satisfied
  - (sneeze object_5) — satisfied
  - (texture object_10) — satisfied
  - (next object_5 object_11) — satisfied
  - (vase object_12 object_5) — satisfied (created by step 2)
- Effects:
  - Add: (next object_12 object_11)
  - Delete: (vase object_12 object_5)
- State change: object_12 now has a "next" link to object_11 (this achieves goal part: (next object_12 object_11)).

4) t = 4 — playerA-sip(hand=object_11, cats=object_1, texture=object_10, next_h_from=object_8, next_c_to=object_9)
- Preconditions (checked before step):
  - (hand object_11) — satisfied
  - (cats object_1) — satisfied
  - (texture object_10) — satisfied
  - (next object_11 object_8) — satisfied (initial fact)
  - (next object_1 object_9) — satisfied (initial fact)
- Effects:
  - Add: (vase object_11 object_1)
  - Delete: (next object_11 object_8)
- State change: object_11 loses the "next" link to object_8 and gains a vase relation with object_1.

5) t = 5 — playerA-paltry(hand=object_11, cats=object_1, texture=object_9)
- Preconditions (checked before step):
  - (hand object_11) — satisfied
  - (cats object_1) — satisfied
  - (texture object_9) — satisfied
  - (vase object_11 object_1) — satisfied (created by step 4)
  - (next object_1 object_9) — satisfied
- Effects:
  - Add: (next object_11 object_9)
  - Delete: (vase object_11 object_1)
- State change: object_11 now has a "next" link to object_9 (this achieves goal part: (next object_11 object_9)).

Final status (after t = 5):
- Both goal predicates are achieved:
  - (next object_11 object_9) — achieved at step 5
  - (next object_12 object_11) — achieved at step 3
- Total plan cost: 5 actions (assumed unit cost each).

Notes:
- All preconditions required by each action were present at the time the action was applied (no step failed).
- Each step preserved the agent-specific prefix (playerA) as in the original plan.
