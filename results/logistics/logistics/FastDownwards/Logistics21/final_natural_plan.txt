Summary: following the given plan exactly, four actions (each 1 time unit) transform the initial state into a state that satisfies the goal (next object_12 object_11). For each step below I list timestamp/duration, the action with its parameters, the required preconditions and whether they are satisfied at that time, and the resulting effects / state updates.

Step 1 — Time 0.0 → 1.0 (duration 1)
- Action: wretched object_5 object_9 object_10 object_3
- Parameters mapping: ?x=object_5, ?y=object_9, ?z=object_10, ?w=object_3
- Preconditions (required):
  - (sneeze object_5) — satisfied (initial)
  - (texture object_9) — satisfied (initial)
  - (texture object_10) — satisfied (initial)
  - (stupendous object_3) — satisfied (initial)
  - (next object_5 object_9) — satisfied (initial)
  - (collect object_9 object_3) — satisfied (initial)
  - (collect object_10 object_3) — satisfied (initial)
- Effects (applied):
  - Add: (next object_5 object_10)
  - Delete: (next object_5 object_9)
- Resulting relevant facts after step 1:
  - next object_5 object_10 is true
  - next object_5 object_9 is false (removed)

Step 2 — Time 1.0 → 2.0 (duration 1)
- Action: clip object_12 object_5 object_10
- Parameters: ?x=object_12, ?y=object_5, ?z=object_10
- Preconditions (required):
  - (hand object_12) — satisfied (initial)
  - (sneeze object_5) — satisfied (initial)
  - (texture object_10) — satisfied (initial)
  - (next object_5 object_10) — satisfied (created in Step 1)
  - (next object_12 object_10) — satisfied (initial)
- Effects (applied):
  - Add: (vase object_12 object_5)
  - Delete: (next object_12 object_10)
- Resulting relevant facts after step 2:
  - vase object_12 object_5 is true
  - next object_12 object_10 is false (removed)

Step 3 — Time 2.0 → 3.0 (duration 1)
- Action: wretched object_5 object_10 object_11 object_3
- Parameters: ?x=object_5, ?y=object_10, ?z=object_11, ?w=object_3
- Preconditions (required):
  - (sneeze object_5) — satisfied
  - (texture object_10) — satisfied
  - (texture object_11) — satisfied
  - (stupendous object_3) — satisfied
  - (next object_5 object_10) — satisfied (from Step 1; Step 2 did not remove it)
  - (collect object_10 object_3) — satisfied (initial)
  - (collect object_11 object_3) — satisfied (initial)
- Effects (applied):
  - Add: (next object_5 object_11)
  - Delete: (next object_5 object_10)
- Resulting relevant facts after step 3:
  - next object_5 object_11 is true
  - next object_5 object_10 is false (removed)

Step 4 — Time 3.0 → 4.0 (duration 1)
- Action: tightfisted object_12 object_5 object_11
- Parameters: ?x=object_12, ?y=object_5, ?z=object_11
- Preconditions (required):
  - (hand object_12) — satisfied
  - (sneeze object_5) — satisfied
  - (texture object_11) — satisfied
  - (next object_5 object_11) — satisfied (created in Step 3)
  - (vase object_12 object_5) — satisfied (created in Step 2)
- Effects (applied):
  - Add: (next object_12 object_11)
  - Delete: (vase object_12 object_5)
- Resulting relevant facts after step 4:
  - next object_12 object_11 is true (goal achieved)
  - vase object_12 object_5 is false (removed)

Final result:
- The plan of four actions (wretched, clip, wretched, tightfisted) is executable given the initial facts and the action schemas. All preconditions at each step are satisfied when the action is applied. The final state contains (next object_12 object_11), so the scenario-1 goal is achieved at time 4.0.
