Below is a clear, step-by-step, human-readable trace of the provided plan. Each step matches the plan exactly (no steps added or removed). I list a simple timestamp (t = step number) and assume 1.0 time unit per action for readability. For each action I show the parameter bindings and a short plain-English description of the primary effect (based on the domain action definitions).

Summary assumption: each step duration = 1.0 time unit. Total steps = 17, total cost reported by plan = 17.

Step 1 — t=1.0 — wretched(object_3, object_6, object_5, object_1)
- Parameters: sneeze_obj = object_3, tex1 = object_6, tex2 = object_5, stup = object_1
- Effect (plain): change next(object_3, object_6) into next(object_3, object_5). (next(object_3,object_6) is removed; next(object_3,object_5) is added.)

Step 2 — t=2.0 — wretched(object_4, object_8, object_10, object_2)
- Parameters: sneeze_obj = object_4, tex1 = object_8, tex2 = object_10, stup = object_2
- Effect: change next(object_4, object_8) into next(object_4, object_10). (remove next(object_4,object_8); add next(object_4,object_10).)

Step 3 — t=3.0 — clip(object_12, object_4, object_10)
- Parameters: hand = object_12, sneeze_obj = object_4, tex = object_10
- Effect: create vase(object_12, object_4) and remove next(object_12, object_10). (hand object_12 forms a vase relation with sneeze object_4; previous next(hand,tex) is deleted.)

Step 4 — t=4.0 — wretched(object_4, object_10, object_9, object_2)
- Parameters: sneeze_obj = object_4, tex1 = object_10, tex2 = object_9, stup = object_2
- Effect: change next(object_4, object_10) into next(object_4, object_9). (remove next(object_4,object_10); add next(object_4,object_9).)

Step 5 — t=5.0 — clip(object_11, object_4, object_9)
- Parameters: hand = object_11, sneeze_obj = object_4, tex = object_9
- Effect: create vase(object_11, object_4) and remove next(object_11, object_9). (hand object_11 forms vase with object_4; next(object_11,object_9) removed.)

Step 6 — t=6.0 — wretched(object_4, object_9, object_8, object_2)
- Parameters: sneeze_obj = object_4, tex1 = object_9, tex2 = object_8, stup = object_2
- Effect: change next(object_4, object_9) into next(object_4, object_8). (remove next(object_4,object_9); add next(object_4,object_8).)

Step 7 — t=7.0 — tightfisted(object_12, object_4, object_8)
- Parameters: hand = object_12, sneeze_obj = object_4, tex = object_8
- Effect: create next(object_12, object_8) and remove vase(object_12, object_4). (hand object_12 now has next -> object_8; vase(object_12,object_4) deleted.)

Step 8 — t=8.0 — tightfisted(object_11, object_4, object_8)
- Parameters: hand = object_11, sneeze_obj = object_4, tex = object_8
- Effect: create next(object_11, object_8) and remove vase(object_11, object_4). (hand object_11 now has next -> object_8; vase(object_11,object_4) deleted.)

Step 9 — t=9.0 — memory(object_0, object_5, object_8)
- Parameters: cat = object_0, from = object_5, to = object_8
- Effect: change next(object_0, object_5) into next(object_0, object_8). (move the next relation for object_0 from object_5 to object_8.)

Step 10 — t=10.0 — sip(object_12, object_0, object_8)
- Parameters: hand = object_12, cat = object_0, tex = object_8
- Effect: create vase(object_12, object_0) and remove next(object_12, object_8). (hand object_12 now has vase relation with cat object_0; previous next(object_12,object_8) removed.)

Step 11 — t=11.0 — sip(object_11, object_0, object_8)
- Parameters: hand = object_11, cat = object_0, tex = object_8
- Effect: create vase(object_11, object_0) and remove next(object_11, object_8). (hand object_11 now has vase with object_0; next(object_11,object_8) removed.)

Step 12 — t=12.0 — memory(object_0, object_8, object_5)
- Parameters: cat = object_0, from = object_8, to = object_5
- Effect: change next(object_0, object_8) into next(object_0, object_5). (move next for object_0 back from object_8 to object_5.)

Step 13 — t=13.0 — paltry(object_12, object_0, object_5)
- Parameters: hand = object_12, cat = object_0, tex = object_5
- Effect: create next(object_12, object_5) and remove vase(object_12, object_0). (hand object_12 now has next -> object_5; vase(object_12,object_0) deleted.)

Step 14 — t=14.0 — paltry(object_11, object_0, object_5)
- Parameters: hand = object_11, cat = object_0, tex = object_5
- Effect: create next(object_11, object_5) and remove vase(object_11, object_0). (hand object_11 now has next -> object_5; vase(object_11,object_0) deleted.)

Step 15 — t=15.0 — clip(object_11, object_3, object_5)
- Parameters: hand = object_11, sneeze_obj = object_3, tex = object_5
- Effect: create vase(object_11, object_3) and remove next(object_11, object_5). (hand object_11 now has vase with object_3; next(object_11,object_5) removed.)

Step 16 — t=16.0 — wretched(object_3, object_5, object_7, object_1)
- Parameters: sneeze_obj = object_3, tex1 = object_5, tex2 = object_7, stup = object_1
- Effect: change next(object_3, object_5) into next(object_3, object_7). (remove next(object_3,object_5); add next(object_3,object_7).)

Step 17 — t=17.0 — tightfisted(object_11, object_3, object_7)
- Parameters: hand = object_11, sneeze_obj = object_3, tex = object_7
- Effect: create next(object_11, object_7) and remove vase(object_11, object_3). (hand object_11 now has next -> object_7; vase(object_11,object_3) deleted.)

Final state check (as achieved by the above steps):
- next(object_11, object_7) — established at Step 17.
- next(object_12, object_5) — established at Step 13 and not subsequently removed (so it holds at the end).

Both goal facts (next object_11 object_7) and (next object_12 object_5) are satisfied by the executed sequence.

Notes:
- Each step above corresponds exactly to one action in the provided plan in the same order.
- Timestamps are step indices (t=1.0 … t=17.0) with an assumed per-action duration of 1.0 time unit for readability.
- Total reported plan cost = 17 (unit cost), matching the original plan comment.
