Below is a step-by-step, human-readable execution of the provided PDDL plan. Each step matches the plan exactly (same actions and parameters, same order). I give a timestamp (starting t=0.0, each step 1.0 time unit), state whether the action's preconditions are satisfied at that time (they are, per the provided initial state and prior effects), and the concrete effects (what predicate is added and what predicate is deleted).

t = 0.0 — Step 1
Action: clip object_11 object_4 object_10
- Preconditions (checked): hand(object_11), sneeze(object_4), texture(object_10), next(object_4,object_10), next(object_11,object_10) — all satisfied.
- Effects: add vase(object_11,object_4). delete next(object_11,object_10).

t = 1.0 — Step 2
Action: wretched object_3 object_7 object_6 object_1
- Preconditions (checked): sneeze(object_3), texture(object_7), texture(object_6), stupendous(object_1), next(object_3,object_7), collect(object_7,object_1), collect(object_6,object_1) — all satisfied.
- Effects: add next(object_3,object_6). delete next(object_3,object_7).

t = 2.0 — Step 3
Action: clip object_12 object_3 object_6
- Preconditions (checked): hand(object_12), sneeze(object_3), texture(object_6), next(object_3,object_6) (added in step 2), next(object_12,object_6) — all satisfied.
- Effects: add vase(object_12,object_3). delete next(object_12,object_6).

t = 3.0 — Step 4
Action: wretched object_3 object_6 object_5 object_1
- Preconditions (checked): sneeze(object_3), texture(object_6), texture(object_5), stupendous(object_1), next(object_3,object_6) (from step 2), collect(object_6,object_1), collect(object_5,object_1) — all satisfied.

Action: wretched object_4 object_10 object_8 object_2
- Preconditions (checked): sneeze(object_4), texture(object_10), texture(object_8), stupendous(object_2), next(object_4,object_10), collect(object_10,object_2), collect(object_8,object_2) — all satisfied.

Action: tightfisted object_11 object_4 object_8
- Preconditions (checked): hand(object_11), sneeze(object_4), texture(object_8), next(object_4,object_8) (added in step 6), vase(object_11,object_4) (added in step 1) — all satisfied.
- Effects: add next(object_11,object_8). delete vase(object_11,object_4).

t = 7.0 — Step 8
Action: wretched object_4 object_8 object_9 object_2
- Preconditions (checked): sneeze(object_4), texture(object_8), texture(object_9), stupendous(object_2), next(object_4,object_8) (from step 6), collect(object_8,object_2), collect(object_9,object_2) — all satisfied.
- Effects: add next(object_4,object_9). delete next(object_4,object_8).

t = 8.0 — Step 9
Action: clip object_13 object_4 object_9
- Preconditions (checked): hand(object_13), sneeze(object_4), texture(object_9), next(object_4,object_9) (added in step 8), next(object_13,object_9) — all satisfied.
- Effects: add vase(object_13,object_4). delete next(object_13,object_9).

t = 9.0 — Step 10
Action: wretched object_4 object_9 object_10 object_2
- Preconditions (checked): sneeze(object_4), texture(object_9), texture(object_10), stupendous(object_2), next(object_4,object_9) (from step 8), collect(object_9,object_2), collect(object_10,object_2) — all satisfied.
- Effects: add next(object_4,object_10). delete next(object_4,object_9).

t = 10.0 — Step 11
Action: tightfisted object_13 object_4 object_10
- Preconditions (checked): hand(object_13), sneeze(object_4), texture(object_10), next(object_4,object_10) (added in step 10), vase(object_13,object_4) (added in step 9) — all satisfied.
- Effects: add next(object_13,object_10). delete vase(object_13,object_4).

t = 11.0 — Step 12
Action: memory object_0 object_8 object_5
- Preconditions (checked): cats(object_0), spring(object_8), spring(object_5), next(object_0,object_8) — all satisfied.
- Effects: add next(object_0,object_5). delete next(object_0,object_8).

t = 12.0 — Step 13
Action: sip object_12 object_0 object_5
- Preconditions (checked): hand(object_12), cats(object_0), texture(object_5), next(object_12,object_5) (from step 5), next(object_0,object_5) (from step 12) — all satisfied.

t = 13.0 — Step 14
Action: memory object_0 object_5 object_8
- Preconditions (checked): cats(object_0), spring(object_5), spring(object_8), next(object_0,object_5) (added in step 12) — all satisfied.
- Effects: add next(object_0,object_8). delete next(object_0,object_5).

t = 14.0 — Step 15
Action: paltry object_12 object_0 object_8
- Preconditions (checked): hand(object_12), cats(object_0), texture(object_8), vase(object_12,object_0) (added in step 13), next(object_0,object_8) (re-added in step 14) — all satisfied.
- Effects: add next(object_12,object_8). delete vase(object_12,object_0).

Final state summary (after t = 14.0)
- The plan achieves the goal predicates requested in the problem:
  - next(object_11,object_8) — added at step 7.
  - next(object_12,object_8) — added at step 15.
  - next(object_13,object_10) — added at step 11.
- All plan steps were applicable in sequence (preconditions satisfied when executed) and their stated add/delete effects produce the final goal.

Notes
- Each step was given a 1.0 time-unit duration for readability; these timestamps are illustrative and reflect the plan order (t = 0.0, 1.0, ..., 14.0).
- All steps and parameters exactly match the provided plan. No steps were added or removed.
