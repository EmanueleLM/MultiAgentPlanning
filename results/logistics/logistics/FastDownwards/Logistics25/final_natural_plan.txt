Plan summary (sequential; each action duration = 1 time unit; timestamps cumulative):

Step 1 — t=0.0 → 1.0 (duration 1.0)
Action: pickup agent1 object_13 at loc2
Description: Agent1 picks up object_13 from location loc2. After this action agent1 is holding object_13 and no longer handfree; object_13 is no longer at loc2.

Step 2 — t=1.0 → 2.0 (duration 1.0)
Action: pickup agent2 object_11 at loc2
Description: Agent2 picks up object_11 from location loc2. After this action agent2 is holding object_11 and no longer handfree; object_11 is no longer at loc2.

Step 3 — t=2.0 → 3.0 (duration 1.0)
Action: move agent1 from loc2 to loc3
Description: Agent1 moves from loc2 to loc3 while holding object_13.

Step 4 — t=3.0 → 4.0 (duration 1.0)
Action: move agent2 from loc2 to loc1
Description: Agent2 moves from loc2 to loc1 while holding object_11.

Step 5 — t=4.0 → 5.0 (duration 1.0)
Action: put-next agent2 object_11 next to object_8 at loc1
Description: At loc1, Agent2 places object_11 so that next(object_11, object_8) becomes true. Agent2 is no longer holding object_11 and becomes handfree.

Step 6 — t=5.0 → 6.0 (duration 1.0)
Action: put-next agent1 object_13 next to object_10 at loc3
Description: At loc3, Agent1 places object_13 so that next(object_13, object_10) becomes true. Agent1 is no longer holding object_13 and becomes handfree.

Step 7 — t=6.0 → 7.0 (duration 1.0)
Action: move agent2 from loc1 to loc2
Description: Agent2 returns from loc1 to loc2.

Step 8 — t=7.0 → 8.0 (duration 1.0)
Action: pickup agent2 object_12 at loc2
Description: Agent2 picks up object_12 from location loc2. After this action agent2 is holding object_12 and no longer handfree; object_12 is no longer at loc2.

Step 9 — t=8.0 → 9.0 (duration 1.0)
Action: move agent2 from loc2 to loc1
Description: Agent2 moves from loc2 to loc1 while holding object_12.

Step 10 — t=9.0 → 10.0 (duration 1.0)
Action: put-next agent2 object_12 next to object_8 at loc1
Description: At loc1, Agent2 places object_12 so that next(object_12, object_8) becomes true. Agent2 is no longer holding object_12 and becomes handfree.

Outcome (at t = 10.0)
- Achieved goal predicates:
  - next object_11 object_8 (created at step 5)
  - next object_12 object_8 (created at step 10)
  - next object_13 object_10 (created at step 6)

Total plan cost: 10 (10 actions, unit cost each).
