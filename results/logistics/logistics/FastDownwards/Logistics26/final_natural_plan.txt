1) t=0s (duration 1s) — memory_A by hand object_14
   - Action called: memory (analyst_A)
   - Parameters: h=object_14, old=object_8, new=object_11, c=object_3
   - Precondition checked: (hand object_14), (next object_14 object_8), (collect object_11 object_3)
   - Effect: remove (next object_14 object_8); add (next object_14 object_11)

2) t=1s (duration 1s) — memory_A by hand object_13
   - Action called: memory (analyst_A)
   - Parameters: h=object_13, old=object_7, new=object_10, c=object_2
   - Precondition checked: (hand object_13), (next object_13 object_7), (collect object_10 object_2)
   - Effect: remove (next object_13 object_7); add (next object_13 object_10)

3) t=2s (duration 1s) — memory_A by hand object_12
   - Action called: memory (analyst_A)
   - Parameters: h=object_12, old=object_11, new=object_6, c=object_1
   - Precondition checked: (hand object_12), (next object_12 object_11), (collect object_6 object_1)
   - Effect: remove (next object_12 object_11); add (next object_12 object_6)

4) t=3s (duration 1s) — memory_A by hand object_12
   - Action called: memory (analyst_A)
   - Parameters: h=object_12, old=object_7, new=object_9, c=object_2
   - Precondition checked: (hand object_12), (next object_12 object_7), (collect object_9 object_2)
   - Effect: remove (next object_12 object_7); add (next object_12 object_9)

5) t=4s (duration 1s) — memory_A by hand object_11
   - Action called: memory (analyst_A)
   - Parameters: h=object_11, old=object_10, new=object_5, c=object_1
   - Precondition checked: (hand object_11), (next object_11 object_10), (collect object_5 object_1)
   - Effect: remove (next object_11 object_10); add (next object_11 object_5)

Outcome (after all 5 steps; plan cost = 5):
- Goals achieved:
  - (next object_11 object_5) — satisfied by step 5
  - (next object_12 object_9) — satisfied by step 4
  - (next object_13 object_10) — satisfied by step 2
  - (next object_12 object_6) — satisfied by step 3
  - (next object_14 object_11) — satisfied by step 1

All five plan steps are reported exactly as in the provided plan; each step's preconditions were present in the initial state or maintained through prior steps, and the listed effects realize the required goal conjuncts.
