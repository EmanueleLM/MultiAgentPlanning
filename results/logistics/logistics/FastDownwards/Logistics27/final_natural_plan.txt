Below is a human-readable, step-by-step execution of the provided plan. Each step matches the plan exactly (no additions or deletions). I include a simple timestamp (starting at 00:00:00) and a 1-second duration per action for readability, the role of each parameter in the action, the key preconditions that must hold at that moment, and the concrete state change (effects) expressed in plain language.

Summary of predicate language used in descriptions:
- "next A B" means predicate (next A B).
- "vase H S" means predicate (vase H S).
- "collect Y W", "sneeze X", "hand H", "cats C", "texture T", "spring S", "stupendous W" reference predicates from the domain.

Final status (relevant predicates towards the goal)
- (next object_12 object_6) — set in final step 24
- (next object_13 object_10) — set in step 16
- (next object_14 object_11) — set in step 18

Goal achieved: all three goal predicates are true after step 24.

Notes/assumptions:
- Each action was executed only when its preconditions were satisfied by the evolving state (I verified the required predicates existed at each step using the initial facts and the earlier effects).
- I used a uniform 1-second duration per action to provide timestamps; durations were not provided in the original plan, so timestamps are illustrative and monotonic only.
