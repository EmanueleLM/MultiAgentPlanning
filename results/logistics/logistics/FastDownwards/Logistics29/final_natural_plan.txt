Plan (human-readable execution trace)

- Step 1
  - Time: start 0.0, duration 1.0, end 1.0
  - Action: paltry object_11 object_1 object_9
  - Preconditions (checked before executing):
    - (hand object_11)
    - (cats object_1)
    - (texture object_9)
    - (vase object_11 object_1)
    - (next object_1 object_9)
  - Effects (applied at end of step):
    - Add: (next object_11 object_9)
    - Delete: (vase object_11 object_1)
  - Resulting note: After this action, object_11 now has next relation to object_9; the vase relation between object_11 and object_1 is removed.

- Step 2
  - Time: start 1.0, duration 1.0, end 2.0
  - Action: paltry object_11 object_2 object_10
  - Preconditions (checked before executing):
    - (hand object_11)
    - (cats object_2)
    - (texture object_10)
    - (vase object_11 object_2)
    - (next object_2 object_10)
  - Effects (applied at end of step):
    - Add: (next object_11 object_10)
    - Delete: (vase object_11 object_2)
  - Resulting note: After this action, object_11 now has next relation to object_10; the vase relation between object_11 and object_2 is removed.

Final state summary (relevant goal predicates)
- (next object_11 object_9) — achieved by Step 1
- (next object_11 object_10) — achieved by Step 2

Total plan duration: 2.0 time units
