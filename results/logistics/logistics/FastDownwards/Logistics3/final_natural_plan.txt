Summary: the following is a human-readable, step-by-step rendering of the given plan. Each step lists a timestamp (one time unit per action), the action and its parameters, the schema preconditions checked against the current state, the effects applied, and a short confirmation. The sequence exactly matches the provided plan (9 actions, unit cost each; total cost = 9).

Initial relevant facts (excerpted from the combined initial state before step 0)
- cats: object_0, object_1
- hand: object_7, object_8, object_9
- texture: object_5, object_6, object_7
- spring: object_5, object_6, object_7
- sneeze: object_3, object_4, object_5
- stupendous: object_1, object_2, object_3
- collect: (object_5 → object_1), (object_6 → object_2), (object_7 → object_3)
- next relations initially include (relevant subset):
  next object_0 object_6
  next object_1 object_6
  next object_5 object_7
  next object_7 object_6
  next object_8 object_6
  next object_8 object_7
  next object_9 object_7
- no vase facts initially

Plan (timestamps t = 0..8; each step duration = 1 time unit)

Step 1 — t=0 — sip object_8 object_1 object_6
- Schema sip(?x ?y ?z)
  - Preconditions required: hand ?x, cats ?y, texture ?z, next ?x ?z, next ?y ?z

  - hand object_8 — TRUE
  - cats object_1 — TRUE
  - texture object_6 — TRUE
  - next object_8 object_6 — TRUE
  - next object_1 object_6 — TRUE
- Effects applied:
  - add (vase object_8 object_1)
  - delete (next object_8 object_6)
- Confirmation: action valid and executed. next(object_8,object_6) removed; vase(object_8,object_1) added.

Step 2 — t=1 — sip object_7 object_1 object_6
- Schema sip(?x ?y ?z)

  - spring object_5 — TRUE
  - next object_1 object_6 — TRUE
- Effects applied:
  - add (next object_1 object_5)
  - delete (next object_1 object_6)
- Confirmation: action valid and executed. next(object_1,object_6) removed; next(object_1,object_5) added.

Step 4 — t=3 — paltry object_8 object_1 object_5
- Schema paltry(?x ?y ?z)
  - Preconditions required: hand ?x, cats ?y, texture ?z, vase ?x ?y, next ?y ?z
- Instantiated preconditions:
  - hand object_8 — TRUE
  - cats object_1 — TRUE
  - texture object_5 — TRUE
  - vase object_8 object_1 — TRUE (added in Step 1)
  - next object_1 object_5 — TRUE (added in Step 3)
- Effects applied:
  - add (next object_8 object_5)
  - delete (vase object_8 object_1)
- Confirmation: action valid and executed. next(object_8,object_5) added; vase(object_8,object_1) removed.

Step 5 — t=4 — paltry object_7 object_1 object_5
- Schema paltry(?x ?y ?z)
  - Preconditions required: hand ?x, cats ?y, texture ?z, vase ?x ?y, next ?y ?z
- Instantiated preconditions:
  - hand object_7 — TRUE
  - cats object_1 — TRUE
  - texture object_5 — TRUE
  - vase object_7 object_1 — TRUE (added in Step 2)
  - next object_1 object_5 — TRUE (still TRUE from Step 3)
- Effects applied:
  - add (next object_7 object_5)
  - delete (vase object_7 object_1)
- Confirmation: action valid and executed. next(object_7,object_5) added; vase(object_7,object_1) removed.

At this point player1's goals are satisfied:
- next object_7 object_5 — TRUE (added Step 5)
- next object_8 object_5 — TRUE (added Step 4)

Step 6 — t=5 — memory object_1 object_5 object_7
- Schema memory(?x ?y ?z)
  - Preconditions required: cats ?x, spring ?y, spring ?z, next ?x ?y
- Instantiated preconditions:
  - cats object_1 — TRUE
  - spring object_5 — TRUE
  - spring object_7 — TRUE
  - next object_1 object_5 — TRUE (from Step 3; still true until removed)
- Effects applied:
  - add (next object_1 object_7)
  - delete (next object_1 object_5)
- Confirmation: action valid and executed. next(object_1,object_7) added; next(object_1,object_5) removed.

Step 7 — t=6 — sip object_9 object_1 object_7
- Schema sip(?x ?y ?z)
  - Preconditions required: hand ?x, cats ?y, texture ?z, next ?x ?z, next ?y ?z
- Instantiated preconditions:
  - hand object_9 — TRUE
  - cats object_1 — TRUE
  - texture object_7 — TRUE
  - next object_9 object_7 — TRUE (initial)
  - next object_1 object_7 — TRUE (added Step 6)
- Effects applied:
  - add (vase object_9 object_1)
  - delete (next object_9 object_7)
- Confirmation: action valid and executed. next(object_9,object_7) removed; vase(object_9,object_1) added.

Step 8 — t=7 — memory object_1 object_7 object_6
- Schema memory(?x ?y ?z)
  - Preconditions required: cats ?x, spring ?y, spring ?z, next ?x ?y
- Instantiated preconditions:
  - cats object_1 — TRUE
  - spring object_7 — TRUE
  - spring object_6 — TRUE
  - next object_1 object_7 — TRUE (added Step 6; still present)
- Effects applied:
  - add (next object_1 object_6)
  - delete (next object_1 object_7)
- Confirmation: action valid and executed. next(object_1,object_6) re-added; next(object_1,object_7) removed.

Step 9 — t=8 — paltry object_9 object_1 object_6
- Schema paltry(?x ?y ?z)
  - Preconditions required: hand ?x, cats ?y, texture ?z, vase ?x ?y, next ?y ?z
- Instantiated preconditions:
  - hand object_9 — TRUE
  - cats object_1 — TRUE
  - texture object_6 — TRUE
  - vase object_9 object_1 — TRUE (added Step 7)
  - next object_1 object_6 — TRUE (added Step 8)
- Effects applied:
  - add (next object_9 object_6)
  - delete (vase object_9 object_1)
- Confirmation: action valid and executed. next(object_9,object_6) added; vase(object_9,object_1) removed.

Final relevant state (after step 9) — goals check
- next object_7 object_5 — TRUE (achieved Step 5)
- next object_8 object_5 — TRUE (achieved Step 4)
- next object_8 object_7 — TRUE (remained from initial state; never deleted)
- next object_9 object_6 — TRUE (achieved Step 9)

All required goals are satisfied:
- player1 goals: next object_7 object_5 and next object_8 object_5 — satisfied
- player2 goals: next object_8 object_7 and next object_9 object_6 — satisfied

Plan cost: 9 (unit cost per action), total cost = 9.

Notes
- Every action in the provided plan was executed in order, and for each the required preconditions were present at the time of execution.
- The plan does not introduce any contradictions with the public action schemas; all delete/add effects were applied consistently and needed preconditions were available when actions were executed.
