Summary: execute the given 3-step plan in order. Each step shows parameter mapping, precondition check, effects applied, and the resulting relevant facts. I use simple timestamps (start at t=0s) and assume each action takes 1.0s.

Step 1 — t=0.0s (duration 1.0s)
- Action: clip(object_9, object_4, object_7)
- Parameter mapping:
  - object_0 -> object_9
  - object_1 -> object_4
  - object_2 -> object_7
- Preconditions (required / satisfied):
  - (hand object_9) — present ✓
  - (sneeze object_4) — present ✓
  - (texture object_7) — present ✓
  - (next object_4 object_7) — present ✓
  - (next object_9 object_7) — present ✓
  => All preconditions satisfied.
- Effects applied:
  - Add: (vase object_9 object_4)
  - Remove: (next object_9 object_7)
- Resulting relevant facts after Step 1 (changes only):
  - (vase object_9 object_4) is now true.
  - (next object_9 object_7) has been removed (no longer true).
  - All other initial facts remain unchanged.

Step 2 — t=1.0s (duration 1.0s)
- Action: wretched(object_4, object_7, object_8, object_2)
- Parameter mapping:
  - object_0 -> object_4
  - object_1 -> object_7
  - object_2 -> object_8
  - object_3 -> object_2
- Preconditions (required / satisfied):
  - (sneeze object_4) — present ✓
  - (texture object_7) — present ✓
  - (texture object_8) — present ✓
  - (stupendous object_2) — present ✓
  - (next object_4 object_7) — present ✓
  - (collect object_7 object_2) — present ✓
  - (collect object_8 object_2) — present ✓
  => All preconditions satisfied.
- Effects applied:
  - Add: (next object_4 object_8)
  - Remove: (next object_4 object_7)
- Resulting relevant facts after Step 2 (changes cumulative):
  - (next object_4 object_8) is now true.
  - (next object_4 object_7) has been removed.
  - (vase object_9 object_4) from Step 1 remains true.
  - (next object_9 object_7) remains removed.

Step 3 — t=2.0s (duration 1.0s)
- Action: tightfisted(object_9, object_4, object_8)
- Parameter mapping:
  - object_0 -> object_9
  - object_1 -> object_4
  - object_2 -> object_8
- Preconditions (required / satisfied):
  - (hand object_9) — present ✓
  - (sneeze object_4) — present ✓
  - (texture object_8) — present ✓
  - (next object_4 object_8) — present ✓ (added in Step 2) ✓
  - (vase object_9 object_4) — present ✓ (added in Step 1) ✓
  => All preconditions satisfied.
- Effects applied:
  - Add: (next object_9 object_8)
  - Remove: (vase object_9 object_4)
- Resulting relevant facts after Step 3 (final relevant facts):
  - (next object_9 object_8) is now true — this achieves the goal.
  - (vase object_9 object_4) has been removed.
  - (next object_4 object_8) remains true (from Step 2).
  - Other initial facts remain as originally stated except those explicitly removed above.

Goal check
- Goal: (next object_9 object_8)
- Status after Step 3: achieved ✓

Notes / assumptions
- Each action was executed in the exact order provided by the plan and each action duration was assumed 1.0 second for clarity.
- No additional actions or facts were introduced beyond the plan effects and the initial facts.
