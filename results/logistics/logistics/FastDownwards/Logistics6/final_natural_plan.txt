Plan summary (3 steps, unit cost each; timestamps are illustrative — each action takes 1 time unit):

Step 1 — t = 0 → 1
Action: clip object_9 object_4 object_6
- Parameters: actor/object o0=object_9, target sneeze o1=object_4, texture o2=object_6
- Preconditions (checked against the initial state):
  - (hand object_9) — present
  - (sneeze object_4) — present
  - (texture object_6) — present
  - (next object_4 object_6) — present
  - (next object_9 object_6) — present
  ⇒ All preconditions satisfied.
- Effects:
  - Add: (vase object_9 object_4)
  - Delete: (next object_9 object_6)
- Local state change summary after step:
  - (vase object_9 object_4) is now true.
  - (next object_9 object_6) is now false (removed).
  - Other facts unchanged.

Step 2 — t = 1 → 2
Action: wretched object_4 object_6 object_7 object_2
- Parameters: o0=object_4, o1=object_6, o2=object_7, o3=object_2
- Preconditions:
  - (sneeze object_4) — present
  - (texture object_6) — present
  - (texture object_7) — present
  - (stupendous object_2) — present
  - (next object_4 object_6) — present (was true in the initial state and not changed by step 1)
  - (collect object_6 object_2) — present
  - (collect object_7 object_2) — present
  ⇒ All preconditions satisfied.
- Effects:
  - Add: (next object_4 object_7)
  - Delete: (next object_4 object_6)
- Local state change summary after step:
  - (next object_4 object_7) is now true.
  - (next object_4 object_6) is now false (removed).
  - (vase object_9 object_4) from step 1 remains true.

Step 3 — t = 2 → 3
Action: tightfisted object_9 object_4 object_7
- Parameters: o0=object_9, o1=object_4, o2=object_7
- Preconditions:
  - (hand object_9) — present
  - (sneeze object_4) — present
  - (texture object_7) — present
  - (next object_4 object_7) — present (established by Step 2)
  - (vase object_9 object_4) — present (established by Step 1)
  ⇒ All preconditions satisfied.
- Effects:
  - Add: (next object_9 object_7)
  - Delete: (vase object_9 object_4)
- Local state change summary after step:
  - (next object_9 object_7) is now true — this is the goal achieved.
  - (vase object_9 object_4) is removed.

Final check
- Goal (next object_9 object_7) is true after Step 3. The three planned actions were applied in order, all preconditions were satisfied when executed, and the final state achieves the required goal.
