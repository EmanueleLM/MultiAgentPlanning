Below is a clear, step-by-step human-readable execution of the given plan. Steps are listed in the exact order of the plan. For each step I show: time (incremental), the action and its object arguments, which preconditions were satisfied at that moment, and the immediate effects (facts added and facts removed). At the end I confirm the goal facts are achieved.

Time 0s — Step 1:
Action: clip object_9 object_3 object_5
- Preconditions satisfied: hand(object_9), sneeze(object_3), texture(object_5), next(object_3, object_5), next(object_9, object_5).
- Effects: add vase(object_9, object_3); remove next(object_9, object_5).
- Notes: object_9 creates a vase relation with object_3; the previous next link from object_9 to object_5 is removed.

Time 10s — Step 2:
Action: wretched object_3 object_5 object_6 object_1
- Preconditions satisfied: sneeze(object_3), texture(object_5), texture(object_6), stupendous(object_1), next(object_3, object_5), collect(object_5, object_1), collect(object_6, object_1).
- Effects: add next(object_3, object_6); remove next(object_3, object_5).
- Notes: object_3’s next pointer moves from object_5 to object_6.

Time 20s — Step 3:
Action: tightfisted object_9 object_3 object_6
- Preconditions satisfied: hand(object_9), sneeze(object_3), texture(object_6), next(object_3, object_6), vase(object_9, object_3).
- Effects: add next(object_9, object_6); remove vase(object_9, object_3).
- Notes: object_9’s next now points to object_6 (goal-related fact); the vase relation with object_3 is consumed/removed.

Time 30s — Step 4:
Action: sip object_10 object_0 object_5
- Preconditions satisfied: hand(object_10), cats(object_0), texture(object_5), next(object_10, object_5), next(object_0, object_5).
- Effects: add vase(object_10, object_0); remove next(object_10, object_5).
- Notes: object_10 forms a vase relation with object_0; object_10’s previous next-to-object_5 is removed.

Time 40s — Step 5:
Action: memory object_0 object_5 object_7
- Preconditions satisfied: cats(object_0), spring(object_5), spring(object_7), next(object_0, object_5).
- Effects: add next(object_0, object_7); remove next(object_0, object_5).
- Notes: object_0’s next pointer is updated from object_5 to object_7.

Time 50s — Step 6:
Action: paltry object_10 object_0 object_7
- Preconditions satisfied: hand(object_10), cats(object_0), texture(object_7), vase(object_10, object_0), next(object_0, object_7).
- Effects: add next(object_10, object_7); remove vase(object_10, object_0).
- Notes: object_10’s next now points to object_7 (this achieves next object_10 → object_7).

Time 60s — Step 7:
Action: wretched object_5 object_8 object_9 object_3
- Preconditions satisfied: sneeze(object_5), texture(object_8), texture(object_9), stupendous(object_3), next(object_5, object_8), collect(object_8, object_3), collect(object_9, object_3).
- Effects: add next(object_5, object_9); remove next(object_5, object_8).
- Notes: object_5’s next is changed from object_8 to object_9.

Time 70s — Step 8:
Action: clip object_11 object_5 object_9
- Preconditions satisfied: hand(object_11), sneeze(object_5), texture(object_9), next(object_5, object_9), next(object_11, object_9).
- Effects: add vase(object_11, object_5); remove next(object_11, object_9).
- Notes: object_11 forms a vase relation with object_5; its next link to object_9 is removed.

Time 80s — Step 9:
Action: wretched object_5 object_9 object_8 object_3
- Preconditions satisfied: sneeze(object_5), texture(object_9), texture(object_8), stupendous(object_3), next(object_5, object_9), collect(object_9, object_3), collect(object_8, object_3).
- Effects: add next(object_5, object_8); remove next(object_5, object_9).
- Notes: object_5’s next is changed back to object_8 (restoring that relation).

Time 90s — Step 10:
Action: tightfisted object_11 object_5 object_8
- Preconditions satisfied: hand(object_11), sneeze(object_5), texture(object_8), next(object_5, object_8), vase(object_11, object_5).
- Effects: add next(object_11, object_8); remove vase(object_11, object_5).
- Notes: object_11’s next now points to object_8 (this achieves next object_11 → object_8).

Final check (after Step 10):
- next(object_10, object_6): true (present initially and never removed).
- next(object_9, object_6): true (added at Step 3).
- next(object_10, object_7): true (added at Step 6).
- next(object_11, object_8): true (added at Step 10).

All four goal facts are achieved by the above sequence.
