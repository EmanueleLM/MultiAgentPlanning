    "response": "You already have next object_7 object_6 initially, so the only unmet goal is next object_8 object_6. I checked whether any available action can make next object_8 object_6 true given your initial facts, and found it impossible. Summary of the argument:\n\n- Which actions can make a next fact true? paltry, wretched, memory, and tightfisted all have the effect next object_0 object_2 (so one of those would need to be used with object_0 = object_8 and object_2 = object_6).\n\n- Check each candidate with object_0 = 8 and object_2 = 6:\n  - memory object_8 ? 6 requires cats object_8 (and next object_8 ? and springs). cats object_8 is not in the initial state, and no action produces cats, so memory is impossible.\n  - wretched object_8 ? 6 ? requires sneeze object_8. sneeze object_8 is not in the initial state, and no action produces sneeze, so wretched is impossible.\n  - paltry object_8 X 6 requires vase object_8 X and cats X. cats facts exist only for object_0, so X would have to be object_0; paltry would then require vase object_8 object_0. Vase facts can only be produced by sip or clip:\n    - sip object_8 object_0 Y would require cats object_0 (true) but also next object_8 Y and next object_0 Y for some Y. There is no Y for which both next object_8 Y and next object_0 Y hold in your initial state (next 8 5 and next 0 6, different Y), so sip cannot produce the needed vase.\n    - clip object_8 object_0 Y would require sneeze object_8 (which is missing), so clip cannot produce the needed vase either.\n    Thus paltry cannot be enabled.\n  - tightfisted object_8 X 6 requires vase object_8 X and sneeze X; again vase 8 X cannot be produced for any X that has sneeze (no viable combination), so tightfisted cannot be enabled.\n\nBecause none of the actions that could create next object_8 object_6 can be performed from your initial facts, the goal next object_8 object_6 is unattainable as given. Therefore no valid plan exists under the current initial conditions.\n\nIf you can change the initial state, the minimal useful tweak is to add cats object_8. With that added, a one-step plan works:\n- memory object_8 object_5 object_6\n  (preconditions: cats object_8, spring object_5, spring object_6, next object_8 object_5; these all hold once cats object_8 is added; effect: next object_8 object_6)\n\nIf you want, tell me which facts you can add or change and I will produce a concrete plan."

I checked every operator that can create a next(X, Y) fact and the required preconditions; with the given initial facts there is no way to make next object_9 object_6. Reasoning summary:\n\n- Operators that can produce next A B are: paltry(A, .., B), memory(A, .., B), wretched(A, .., B), tightfisted(A, .., B).\n- paltry / tightfisted would need a vase object_9 object_1 (for example) plus next object_1 object_6 (next object_1 object_6 is present). But vase facts can only be created by sip or clip with the same first-argument (i.e. they would need to create vase object_9 ...). Both sip and clip require next object_9 object_6 as a precondition, so creating vase object_9 ... is circular.\n- memory object_9 object_7 object_6 would directly convert next(9,7) \u2192 next(9,6), but memory requires cats object_9, and no operator creates cats facts; cats object_9 is not in the initial state.\n- wretched would require sneeze object_9 and certain collect facts (collect object_6 object_3, etc.) that are not available; sneeze object_9 is not present and cannot be produced by any operator.\n\nConclusion: with the given initial facts and operators the goal next object_9 object_6 is unreachable, so no valid plan exists.\n\nIf you can change the initial state slightly, here are small fixes and the single-step plan that would then work:\n- Add cats object_9: then use memory object_9 object_7 object_6 (preconditions: cats 9, spring 7, spring 6, next 9 7 \u2014 all satisfied) \u2192 achieves next 9 6.\n- OR add vase object_9 object_1: then paltry object_9 object_1 object_6 (preconditions: hand 9, cats 1, texture 6, vase 9 1, next 1 6) \u2192 achieves next 9 6.\n- OR add sneeze object_9 and collect object_6 object_3 (and ensure appropriate stupendous/collect facts): then wretched could be used (more involved).\n\nTell me which small change you prefer (e.g., add cats object_9) and I will produce the corresponding one-step plan."

    "response": "Answer: no valid plan exists from the given initial state to reach next object_9 object_7.\n\nWhy (concise reasoning):\n\n- To achieve next object_9 object_7 you must add a next with object_0 = object_9 and object_2 = object_7. The only actions that add next with object_0 = object_9 are paltry(object_9, \u2026, object_7) and tightfisted(object_9, \u2026, object_7). (memory requires cats on the subject \u2014 only cats object_0 holds \u2014 and wretched requires sneeze on the subject \u2014 object_9 is not sneeze.) So the plan must use either paltry or tightfisted with object_0 = object_9 and object_2 = object_7.\n\n- paltry(object_9, X, object_7) requires (among other things) cats X and vase object_9 X and next X object_7. The only cats fact is cats object_0, so X would have to be object_0; so paltry needs vase object_9 object_0 and next object_0 object_7. next object_0 object_7 can be produced by memory(object_0, object_5, object_7) (we do have the required cats and springs and next object_0 object_5), so next object_0 object_7 is attainable. But vase object_9 object_0 must be created first.\n\n- The only action that can create vase object_9 object_0 is sip(object_9, object_0, Y) (sip adds vase object_0 object_1 where object_1 must satisfy cats \u2014 so object_1 = object_0). sip requires next object_9 Y and next object_0 Y (and texture Y). That requires a Y such that next object_9 Y and next object_0 Y already both hold. Initially next object_9 object_6 and next object_0 object_5; there is no Y that equals both 5 and 6. memory can change next object_0 object_5 to next object_0 object_7, but that would require next object_9 object_7 already to run sip (circular). Thus vase object_9 object_0 cannot be created without already having next object_9 something that matches next object_0 that you can make \u2014 this produces an unavoidable circular dependency. Therefore paltry route is blocked.\n\n- tightfisted(object_9, S, object_7) requires vase object_9 S, sneeze S, texture object_7, and next S object_7. The only sneeze objects are object_3 and object_4, so S must be object_3 or object_4. We can create vase object_9 object_3 (or object_4) by using clip(object_9, object_3, object_6) after first making next object_3 object_6 via wretched(object_3, object_5, object_6, object_1) \u2014 that sequence is feasible and yields vase object_9 object_3. So vase object_9 object_3 is attainable. But tightfisted then needs next object_3 object_7. The only action that can change next for a sneeze subject (object_3) is wretched(object_3, \u2026). To get next object_3 object_7 by wretched you must have collect object_? facts that match: wretched(object_3, A, B, C) requires collect A C and collect B C for the same C. To produce next object_3 object_7 you would need A and B to be such that collect A C and collect B C hold with A = current successor of object_3 and B = object_7 (or vice versa). Inspecting the given collect facts: collect object_5 object_1, collect object_6 object_1, collect object_7 object_2, collect object_8 object_2. There is no single object_C that is the same for both collect object_6 C and collect object_7 C (they point to different C: object_6 -> object_1, object_7 -> object_2). Therefore you cannot satisfy the wretched precondition that would change next object_3 from its current successor to object_7. So next object_3 object_7 cannot be produced, blocking the tightfisted route.\n\nBecause both possible ways to produce next object_9 object_7 are blocked (paltry route blocked by an unavoidable circular dependence on creating vase object_9 object_0; tightfisted route blocked because you cannot make next object_3 object_7 or next object_4 object_7 given the collect facts), there is no valid plan from the given initial state to reach next object_9 object_7.\n\nIf you want, I can:\n- show the attempted partial sequences and where each fails step-by-step, or\n- suggest minimal changes to the initial facts (which atoms to add or change) that would make the goal reachable and give a concrete plan under those modified conditions."

    "response": "I cannot produce a valid plan \u2014 the goal next object_10 object_6 is unreachable from the given initial facts with the available actions. Reasoning (concise):\n\n- Only actions that can add next object_10 object_6 are paltry, wretched, memory, or tightfisted (they are the only actions whose effect is to add a next relation).\n- memory requires cats object_10 \u2014 initial facts do not include cats object_10, and no action ever adds a cats fact. So memory is impossible for object_10.\n- wretched requires sneeze object_10 \u2014 initial facts do not include sneeze object_10, and no action ever adds sneeze facts. So wretched for object_10 is impossible.\n- That leaves paltry and tightfisted with o0 = object_10:\n  - paltry object_10 o1 object_6 requires:\n    - cats o1, next o1 object_6, texture object_6, hand object_10 (hand is available).\n    - Among objects with cats (only object_0 and object_1), only object_1 has next to object_6 (next object_1 object_6 is true). So paltry would require vase object_10 object_1.\n  - tightfisted object_10 o1 object_6 requires:\n    - sneeze o1, next o1 object_6, texture object_6, vase object_10 o1, hand object_10.\n    - Among sneeze objects (object_4 and object_5), only object_4 has next to object_6 (next object_4 object_6 is true). So tightfisted would require vase object_10 object_4.\n\n- Thus a necessary subgoal is to produce a vase fact of the form vase object_10 object_1 or vase object_10 object_4.\n- The only actions that create vase facts are sip and clip (they create vase object_0 object_1 with object_0 = the hand-holder). To create vase object_10 X we must use sip or clip with object_0 = object_10.\n  - clip object_10 X Y requires next X Y and next object_10 Y (i.e., object_10 and X must share the same Y successor). In the initial state object_10's successor is object_9; to use clip to make vase object_10 object_1 we would need next object_1 object_9 (but next object_1 object_9 is not true and there is no way to make it true because changing next object_1 would require actions that need spring or sneeze on object_1, which are not available).\n  - sip object_10 X Y requires cats X and next object_10 Y and next X Y (i.e., object_10 and X must share the same Y). To get vase object_10 object_1 by sip we would need next object_1 object_9 (so Y = object_9), which again is not available and cannot be produced (no action can give spring object_9 or sneeze object_1 needed for the actions that could change next object_1 appropriately).\n\n- In short: producing vase object_10 object_1 or vase object_10 object_4 is impossible from the initial facts (the required shared successor relations or required preconditions for changing those successors cannot be achieved). Because those vase facts are necessary preconditions for any action that would add next object_10 object_6, the goal is unreachable.\n\nIf you want, I can:\n- attempt an exhaustive search to confirm with a small planner, or\n- show a fuller, step-by-step impossibility proof listing attempted subgoal routes, or\n- suggest minimal changes to the initial facts (e.g., adding cats object_10 or next object_1 object_9 or sneeze object_10) that would make the goal achievable.

    "response": "Short answer: No valid plan exists from the given initial facts to reach next object_10 object_7, next object_11 object_7 and next object_9 object_7. I will explain why and point out the minimal changes that would make the goal achievable.\n\nWhy it is impossible (sketch of proof)\n- Which actions can add a next relation? Only paltry, wretched, memory and tightfisted have \"Once ... performed the following facts will be true: next object_0 object_2\".\n  - memory(o0,o1,o2) adds next(o0,o2) and requires cats(o0) and spring(o1), spring(o2) and next(o0,o1). So memory can only change next for an object o0 that has cats(...). In the initial facts cats(...) is true only for object_0. So memory can only produce next for object_0 \u2014 it cannot produce next for object_9, object_10 or object_11.\n  - wretched(o0,o1,o2,o3) adds next(o0,o2) and requires sneeze(o0). In the initial facts sneeze(...) is true only for object_3 and object_4. So wretched can only change next for object_3 or object_4, not for 9, 10, 11.\n  - paltry(o0,o1,o2) and tightfisted(o0,o1,o2) both add next(o0,o2) but both require a vase fact of form vase(o0,o1). They also require next(o1,o2) (and paltry requires cats(o1)). In the given initial facts cats(...) holds only for object_0, so paltry would require vase(o0,0). tightfisted requires vase(o0,sneeze-object) where the second argument must be an object that has sneeze(...).\n\n- So to create next(object_10, object_7) we would need one of:\n  1) memory with o0 = object_10 (impossible \u2014 cats(object_10) is false), or\n  2) wretched with o0 = object_10 (impossible \u2014 sneeze(object_10) is false), or\n  3) paltry or tightfisted with o0 = object_10, which both require a vase involving object_10.\n\n- How can a vase involving object_10 be created? Only clip or sip create vase facts:\n  - clip(o0,o1,o2) requires hand(o0), sneeze(o1), texture(o2), next(o1,o2) and next(o0,o2). clip adds vase(o0,o1) and deletes next(o0,o2).\n  - sip(o0,o1,o2) requires hand(o0), cats(o1), texture(o2), next(o0,o2) and next(o1,o2). sip adds vase(o0,o1) and deletes next(o0,o2).\n\n  Note both clip and sip require next(o0,o2) (i.e. some next with the same o0) as a precondition. That is, to create vase(object_10, X) via clip/sip you already need next(object_10, something). In other words, creating vase for object_10 depends on an existing next for object_10. That is circular if your goal is to produce any new next for object_10 in the first place.\n\n- Therefore there is no way (given the initial facts) to produce the needed vase facts for object_9, 10, 11, nor to apply memory or wretched on those objects. Hence next(object_10, object_7), next(object_11, object_7) and next(object_9, object_7) are unreachable from this initial state.\n\nConcrete impossibility points for each target\n- object_10: cannot use memory (no cats(10)), cannot use wretched (no sneeze(10)), and paltry/tightfisted both need vase involving 10, but any way of producing vase(10,\u00b7) requires an existing next(10,\u00b7) (clip/sip preconditions). Circular \u2192 impossible.\n- object_11 and object_9: identical reasoning as for object_10 (no cats, no sneeze, vase would require preexisting next for same object).\n\nWhat is reachable\n- You can change next relations for:\n  - object_0 by memory (cats object_0 exists). Example: memory object_0 object_5 object_7 is valid (requires next object_0 object_5, spring 5 and 7), so you can get next object_0 object_7.\n  - object_3 and object_4 by wretched (they have sneeze). For example you can change next3 5 -> next3 6 using the collect(5,1) & collect(6,1) & stupendous(1) triple as in wretched(3,5,6,1). Also you can change next4 7 -> next4 8 using the collect(7,2) & collect(8,2) & stupendous(2) triple.\n\nIf you want a valid plan\n- Modify the initial facts in one of the following minimal ways and I can produce a plan:\n  - Give cats(object_9) and/or cats(object_10) and/or cats(object_11) \u2014 then memory can produce next for those objects (if matching spring facts exist).\n  - Or give sneeze(object_9) and/or sneeze(object_10) and/or sneeze(object_11) \u2014 then wretched could be used to change next for those objects (if the collect/stupendous prerequisites are satisfied).\n  - Or add a vase(object_10, object_0) (or vase for 9/11) directly in the initial state \u2014 then paltry/tightfisted can be used (combined with an appropriate next for the second arg) to produce next(object_10, object_7).\n  - Or add a next(object_10, some_texture) pre-existing so that clip or sip can create the necessary vase for object_10 (breaking the circular dependency).\n\nIf you tell me which minimal change you'd like (e.g., \"add sneeze object_10\" or \"add cats object_11\" or \"add vase object_10 object_0\"), I will produce a concrete, step-by-step plan."

    "response": "I can achieve next object_10 object_8 and next object_11 object_7 with this valid action sequence, but next object_9 object_6 is not achievable from the given initial facts and operators. Reasoning and plan below.\n\nWhy next object_9 object_6 is impossible\n- object_9 is a hand, so only operators that can add a \"next\" for it are paltry (adds next hand t) or tightfisted (adds next hand t).\n- paltry(object_9, c, t) requires next(c, t) with c = the cats object (object_0). That would require next object_0 object_6. The only operator that changes next for the cats object_0 is memory(object_0, s1, s2), and that can only move next from one spring to another spring (it requires both s1 and s2 to be spring objects). The only springs available are object_5 and object_7, so next object_0 object_6 cannot be produced.\n- tightfisted(object_9, s, 6) requires next(s,6) for some sneeze s and a vase object_9 s. There is a sneeze (object_3) with next object_3 object_6 already, so tightfisted would need vase object_9 object_3. The only operator that creates vase(h,s) is clip(h,s,t), but clip(h,s,t) requires next(h,t) as a precondition \u2014 for h=object_9 the required next would be next object_9 object_6 (the very goal). Thus creating vase object_9 object_3 is circular / impossible without already having next object_9 object_6.\n- No other operator can add next for hand object_9. Therefore next object_9 object_6 is unreachable.\n\nPlan that achieves the other two goals (next object_10 object_8 and next object_11 object_7)\n1. sip object_10 object_0 object_5\n   - creates vase(object_10, object_0) (requires next object_10 object_5 and next object_0 object_5, which hold)\n2. sip object_11 object_0 object_5\n   - creates vase(object_11, object_0) (requires next object_11 object_5 and next object_0 object_5)\n3. memory object_0 object_5 object_7\n   - changes next object_0 object_5 -> next object_0 object_7 (requires spring object_5 and spring object_7)\n4. paltry object_10 object_0 object_7\n   - uses vase(object_10,object_0) and next object_0 object_7 to add next object_10 object_7\n5. paltry object_11 object_0 object_7\n   - uses vase(object_11,object_0) and next object_0 object_7 to add next object_11 object_7\n   - (goal next object_11 object_7 satisfied here)\n6. clip object_10 object_4 object_7\n   - uses next object_4 object_7 (initially true) and next object_10 object_7 (from step 4) to create vase(object_10,object_4) and deletes next object_10 object_7\n7. wretched object_4 object_7 object_8 object_2\n   - changes next object_4 object_7 -> next object_4 object_8 (collect 7 2 and collect 8 2 both hold; stupendous object_2 holds)\n8. tightfisted object_10 object_4 object_8\n   - uses vase(object_10,object_4) and next object_4 object_8 to add next object_10 object_8\n   - (goal next object_10 object_8 satisfied here)\n\nSummary\n- Achieved: next object_10 object_8 and next object_11 object_7 (by the sequence above).\n- Not achievable: next object_9 object_6 (proved impossible given the preconditions/effects of the available actions and the initial facts).

    "response": "Short answer: I can achieve next object_11 object_9 and next object_12 object_8 with a valid action sequence, but next object_10 object_7 is unreachable from the given initial facts and operators. Below I give a correct plan that achieves the two reachable goals and then a concise proof why next object_10 object_7 cannot be reached.\n\nPlan (sequence of actions that is executable from the given initial state)\n1. memory object_1 object_8 object_6\n2. sip    object_11 object_1 object_6\n3. memory object_1 object_6 object_8\n4. paltry object_11 object_1 object_8\n5. clip   object_11 object_5 object_8\n6. wretched object_5 object_8 object_9 object_3\n7. tightfisted object_11 object_5 object_9\n8. memory object_1 object_8 object_6\n9. sip    object_12 object_1 object_6\n10. memory object_1 object_6 object_8\n11. paltry object_12 object_1 object_8\n12. clip   object_10 object_5 object_9\n13. wretched object_5 object_9 object_8 object_3\n14. tightfisted object_10 object_5 object_8\n\nResult after this sequence:\n- next object_11 object_9 (achieved at step 7),\n- next object_12 object_8 (achieved at step 11),\n- next object_10 object_8 (achieved at step 14).\n\nWhy next object_10 object_7 is unreachable\n- The only operators that can create a next relation for a hand (next hand t) are paltry and tightfisted.\n- paltry creates next hand t by copying a cat's next (it requires next cat t). Cats here can only ever have their next set to spring objects 6 or 8 (memory only swaps between the two spring objects present, 6 and 8). Thus paltry can only produce next hand 6 or 8, never 7.\n- tightfisted creates next hand t by copying a sneeze's next (it requires next sneeze t and vase hand sneeze). Which sneeze objects can have t = 7? Only sneeze object_4 can have next = 7 (it starts at 7 and can only toggle between 7 and 6 because the only collect pairs for one stupendous are {6,7}). To use tightfisted with sneeze object_4 you need to first create a vase relation vase object_10 object_4. The only action that creates vase hand sneeze is clip, and clip requires there be some texture t such that next object_10 t and next object_4 t already both hold. But object_4's next may only be 6 or 7, while object_10's initial next is 9 and the only sneeze that can be made to match 9 is object_5 (not object_4). There is no available sequence of operators that makes object_4 share a texture t with object_10 without already having next object_10 7 (which is the target). Thus you cannot create vase object_10 object_4 and so tightfisted cannot be used to get next object_10 7.\n- Because paltry cannot produce 7 (cats cannot point to 7) and tightfisted cannot be applied for s = object_4 to hand = object_10 (vase object_10 object_4 cannot be produced), achieving next object_10 object_7 is impossible from the given initial facts and available operators.\n\nIf you want, I can:\n- produce a detailed state-by-state trace showing all preconditions/effects for each step above, or\n- try alternative goals (or different initial facts) and produce a full plan that achieves all of them."

    "response": "Short answer: there is no complete plan that achieves all four goals (next_10_6, next_11_7, next_12_7, next_9_6) from the given initial state with the provided actions. I can, however, show a short valid plan that achieves next_11_7 and then explain why the remaining goals are unreachable under the action constraints.\n\nValid subsequence (achieves next object_11 object_7)\n1. memory object_0 object_7 object_5\n   - pre: cats object_0, spring object_7, spring object_5, next object_0 object_7 \u2014 all true initially.\n   - effect: makes next object_0 object_5 (and deletes next_0_7).\n2. sip object_11 object_0 object_5\n   - pre: hand object_11, cats object_0, texture object_5, next object_11 object_5 (initial), next object_0 object_5 (from step 1).\n   - effect: creates vase object_11 object_0 (and deletes next_11_5).\n3. memory object_0 object_5 object_7\n   - pre: cats object_0, spring object_5, spring object_7, next object_0 object_5 (from step 1).\n   - effect: restores next object_0 object_7 (deletes next_0_5).\n4. paltry object_11 object_0 object_7\n   - pre: hand object_11, cats object_0, texture object_7, vase object_11 object_0 (from step 2), next object_0 object_7 (from step 3).\n   - effect: creates next object_11 object_7 (and deletes vase object_11 object_0).\n\nSo next_11_7 is achievable with the 4-step sequence above.\n\nWhy the full goal set is not achievable\n- Producers of next relations for hands (objects 9,10,11,12) are paltry and tightfisted (paltry and tightfisted add next hand texture; clip/sip only create vase facts).\n- paltry requires vase(hand, cats_obj). In this domain cats_obj is only object_0, so paltry can only set next(hand, T) where next(object_0, T) holds. The only nexts for object_0 that can be produced/rotated by memory are textures coming from the springs available (object_5 and object_7). Therefore paltry can only ever produce next(hand, object_5) or next(hand, object_7). It cannot produce next(hand, object_6).\n- tightfisted requires vase(hand, sneeze_obj) and next(sneeze_obj, T). The only sneeze objects are object_3 and object_4. So to get next(hand, object_6) via tightfisted we would need:\n  - next(object_3, object_6) or next(object_4, object_6), and\n  - a vase(hand, object_3) or vase(hand, object_4).\n  next(object_3, object_6) can be produced (e.g. by wretched object_3 object_5 object_6 object_1), so that half is possible. The other half (vase(hand, object_3)) must be created by clip(hand, object_3, T) which requires next(hand, T) and next(object_3, T) for the same T. That requires a common T that both hand and object_3 already have next to; but the initial nexts for those objects do not share such a T, and there is no valid sequence of actions that can produce the required common T pairing (because attempts to move nexts around hit the same constraints on collect/spring/stupendous that block producing the needed common T).\n- Concretely, for object_10 to get next_10_6 via tightfisted, we would need a vase(10,3) or vase(10,4). clip to make such a vase would need some texture T with next_10_T and next_3_T (or next_4_T) already true. Initially next_10_8 and next_3_5. There is no valid action sequence (given the collect/spring data) to make next_3_8 or next_4_6 etc. (the needed collect pairings to enable wretched to move those nexts are not present). So vase(10,3) or vase(10,4) cannot be produced, hence tightfisted cannot produce next_10_6.\n- The same type of obstacle blocks producing next_9_6 and next_12_7: paltry cannot produce 6 (only 5 or 7 via object_0), and tightfisted would require making a vase(hand, sneeze) by clip, which in turn requires a shared texture T between that hand and the sneeze object that cannot be established under the given collects/springs. Thus those goals are unreachable.\n\nSummary\n- Achievable: next object_11 object_7 (plan given above).\n- Unachievable (from the given initial state and action definitions): next object_10 object_6, next object_12 object_7, next object_9 object_6. The reason is structural: paltry can only make hand->texture where texture is one of the two textures reachable from object_0 via memory (object_5 and object_7), and the tightfisted/clip route requires a shared texture T between a hand and a sneeze object that cannot be established with the given collect/spring/stupendous facts.\n\nIf you want:\n- I can (a) output the full 4-step plan that achieves next_11_7 in a plan-format, or (b) search for any shorter alternative for next_11_7, or (c) show a more detailed step-by-step impossibility proof for a specific goal (e.g. why next_10_6 cannot be made).

The key bottleneck is next object_11 object_6 \u2014 once you show that is unreachable, the whole goal is unreachable. Short proof of impossibility:\n\nWhich actions can make a new next X Y?\n- paltry(a,b,c) adds next a c\n- memory(a,b,c) adds next a c (but requires cats a, so a must be object_0)\n- tightfisted(a,b,c) adds next a c\n- wretched(a,b,c,d) adds next a c\n\nTo obtain next object_11 object_6, one of those four must be applied with first argument = object_11 and third argument = object_6.\n\nCheck each case:\n\n1) memory(object_11, ...): impossible because memory requires cats object_11; the only cats fact given is cats object_0.\n\n2) wretched(object_11, ...): impossible because wretched requires sneeze object_11; sneeze is only true for object_3 and object_4 in the initial state and no action can make a non-sneeze object into sneeze.\n\n3) paltry(object_11, b, object_6): paltry requires next b object_6 where b must be a cats object (the second parameter must be the cats object \u2014 only cats object_0 exists). So paltry(object_11, object_0, object_6) would require next object_0 object_6. But object_0's next can only be toggled between object_5 and object_7 by memory (memory uses springs 5 and 7); there is no way to produce next object_0 object_6. So paltry cannot produce next object_11 object_6.\n\n4) tightfisted(object_11, b, object_6): tightfisted requires\n   - b be a sneeze object (so b must be object_3, since only object_3 has next to object_6), \n   - next b object_6 (next object_3 object_6 is true initially),\n   - and vase object_11 b must already hold (vase object_11 object_3).\n   So we would need vase object_11 object_3. How can vase object_11 object_3 be produced? Only clip or sip create vase facts:\n   - sip(object_11, object_3, c) requires cats object_3 (false), so impossible.\n   - clip(object_11, object_3, c) requires next object_11 c and next object_3 c. To choose c = object_6 (the only c with next object_3 c true), clip(object_11, object_3, object_6) requires next object_11 object_6 already. That is circular: to make vase object_11 object_3 by clip you would already need next object_11 object_6. So vase object_11 object_3 is unreachable.\n\nThus every route to produce next object_11 object_6 is blocked (either impossible by static preconditions or circular). Therefore next object_11 object_6 cannot be achieved from the given initial state and actions, so the overall goal (which requires that fact) is unreachable. No valid plan exists."

    "response": "Short answer: I can produce a valid plan that achieves next object_11 object_9. The other three goal facts (next object_10 object_6, next object_12 object_7, next object_13 object_9) are not reachable from the given initial facts under the domain rules (I explain why below) unless you change the initial state (I give suggested minimal changes).\n\nPlan (valid w.r.t. the domain; achieves next object_11 object_9)\n\n1) wretched object_5 object_9 object_8 object_3\n   - Pre: sneeze object_5, texture object_9, texture object_8, stupendous object_3, next object_5 object_9, collect object_9 object_3, collect object_8 object_3 \u2014 all true in the initial state.\n   - Effect: sets next object_5 object_8 (and deletes next object_5 object_9).\n\n2) clip object_11 object_5 object_8\n   - Pre: hand object_11, sneeze object_5, texture object_8, next object_5 object_8 (from step 1), next object_11 object_8 (initial) \u2014 all satisfied.\n   - Effect: creates vase object_11 object_5 and deletes next object_11 object_8.\n\n3) wretched object_5 object_8 object_9 object_3\n   - Pre: next object_5 object_8 (still true), textures 8 & 9 and stupendous 3 and corresponding collect facts \u2014 satisfied.\n   - Effect: restores next object_5 object_9 (and deletes next object_5 object_8).\n\n4) tightfisted object_11 object_5 object_9\n   - Pre: hand object_11, sneeze object_5, texture object_9, next object_5 object_9 (from step 3), vase object_11 object_5 (from step 2) \u2014 satisfied.\n   - Effect: creates next object_11 object_9 (and deletes vase object_11 object_5).\n\nAfter step 4 we have next object_11 object_9 (one of your goals). All four steps are executable in the given initial state and respect the preconditions/effects described.\n\nWhy the other goals appear unreachable from the given initial state\n\n- Only four action schemas add next facts: paltry, wretched, memory, tightfisted.\n  - wretched adds next for a sneeze object (sneeze o0 \u2192 next o0 o2).\n  - memory adds next for a cat object (cats o0 \u2192 next o0 o2) but the texture added must be a spring (memory needs spring o1 and spring o2).\n  - paltry and tightfisted add next for a hand, but they both require a vase between that hand and another object (paltry: vase hand\u2013cat; tightfisted: vase hand\u2013sneeze), and they require that the other object already has the desired next target.\n\n- Vase facts can only be created by sip or clip. Both sip and clip require that the hand already has a next to the same texture as the other object (they require next hand texture and next other-object texture). In other words, creating vase(hand, X) is possible only when the hand already points to the same texture as X. That makes vase-creation for a hand dependent on the hand already having a next to some texture \u2014 clip/sip do not create a new hand\u2192texture from nothing, they only convert an existing next into a vase.\n\n- Consequence: to get a hand to point to a texture T (i.e., to create next hand T), you must either:\n  - (A) have paltry (hand, cat, T). That needs vase(hand, cat) and next(cat, T). But vase(hand, cat) requires the hand already to have some next to a texture shared with that cat (circular unless the hand already had a useful next), or\n  - (B) have tightfisted (hand, sneeze, T). That needs vase(hand, sneeze) and next(sneeze, T), and vase(hand, sneeze) again requires the hand already to share a texture with the sneeze.\n\n- Applying that general dependency to your specific unreachable goals:\n  - next object_12 object_7: 7 is a texture reachable only as a target of sneeze object_4 (wretched can make 4 point to 6 or 7). So the only way to make hand 12 point to 7 is tightfisted(12,4,7). That needs vase(12,4). vase(12,4) can be produced only by clip(12,4,x) for some texture x that both 12 and 4 already point to. 4's only possible textures are 6 or 7, so x must be 6 or 7. That means next12 6 or next12 7 must already exist before you can make the vase \u2014 circular. There is no other operation that can create next12 6 or next12 7 without first having a vase involving 12 (paltry/tightfisted require a vase; memory only applies to cats). So next object_12 object_7 is not reachable from the given initial facts.\n  - next object_10 object_6 and next object_13 object_9: similar cyclic dependencies apply. (Hand 10 initially points to 9; to get 10\u21926 you would need to use a tightfisted with sneeze 4 (4 can produce 6) but to create the needed vase you must have had a matching next between 10 and 4 beforehand; such a matching next does not exist and cannot be created without a vase involving 10 \u2014 again circular.) Equivalent arguments apply for hand 13\u21929 given the available sneeze textures and the initial assignments.\n\nIn short: except for hands that initially share a texture with a sneeze (or cat) you can manipulate, you cannot bootstrap a hand to a new sneeze-set texture because creating the necessary vase requires the hand to already share a texture with that sneeze/cat. In your initial state only object_11 shares a manipulable relationship that lets us follow the clip/wretched/tightfisted pattern to reach 11\u21929.\n\nIf you want all four goals to be reachable \u2014 suggested minimal changes\n\nMake a small change to the initial state so a non-circular path exists. Examples (pick one):\n\n- Add a vase fact to allow paltry for hand->cat:\n  - Add vase object_10 object_0 (or vase object_12 object_0, vase object_13 object_1, etc.). If vase object_10 object_0 is true, then paltry object_10 object_0 object_6 can be applied immediately (since next object_0 object_6 is initially true) to create next object_10 object_6.\n- Or give a hand a matching texture with the desired sneeze so clip can create vase:\n  - Add next object_10 object_6 (or next object_13 object_9) directly to the initial facts (this is the easiest but modifies goals trivially).\n- Or add an extra spring so memory can make a cat point to the needed texture (if paltry path is desired). For example, if you want paltry to produce 12\u21927 via a cat, you would need cats to be able to point to 7; that requires spring object_7 and memory facts enabling next cat 7, but this is a larger model change.\n\nIf you want, I can:\n- produce a full plan after you pick one of the above small initial-state modifications, or\n- search again for another possible plan if I misunderstood a constraint.\n\nWhich would you like me to do next?"

Below I give a correct partial plan (makes next_10->6 and next_11->8) and then a concise proof why next_12->7 is unreachable.\n\nPartial plan that is applicable from the given initial state and achieves next object_10 object_6 and next object_11 object_8:\n- clip object_10 object_4 object_7\n  (pre: hand10, sneeze4, texture7, next4->7, next10->7 \u2014 all true; effect: vase10 4, deletes next10->7)\n- wretched object_4 object_7 object_6 object_2\n  (pre: sneeze4, texture7, texture6, stupendous2, next4->7, collect7 2, collect6 2 \u2014 all true; effect: adds next4->6, deletes next4->7)\n- tightfisted object_10 object_4 object_6\n  (pre: hand10, sneeze4, texture6, next4->6, vase10 4 \u2014 satisfied after the two previous actions; effect: adds next10->6, deletes vase10 4)\n\n- clip object_11 object_5 object_9\n  (pre: hand11, sneeze5, texture9, next5->9, next11->9 \u2014 all true; effect: vase11 5, deletes next11->9)\n- wretched object_5 object_9 object_8 object_3\n  (pre: sneeze5, texture9, texture8, stupendous3, next5->9, collect9 3, collect8 3 \u2014 all true; effect: adds next5->8, deletes next5->9)\n- tightfisted object_11 object_5 object_8\n  (pre: hand11, sneeze5, texture8, next5->8, vase11 5 \u2014 satisfied; effect: adds next11->8, deletes vase11 5)\n\nAfter these six actions:\n- next10->6 holds,\n- next11->8 holds,\n- next13->9 already held from the initial state,\nso 2/3 of the required changes are achieved. (The actions above also delete the prior next10->7 and next11->9 \u2014 which is intended.)\n\nWhy next object_12 object_7 is unreachable\n- The only actions that can add a next fact with object_12 as source are paltry(object_12,... ) or tightfisted(object_12,... ) (wretched cannot because it requires the source to be a sneeze object; 12 is not sneeze). Each of those requires a vase fact vase object_12 X to exist (paltry needs vase12 cat; tightfisted needs vase12 sneeze).\n- A vase with second argument a cats object (0 or 1) can only be created by sip, but sip requires next object_12 something already (circular). So paltry routes are circular / not usable to create next12->7 unless next12->7 already existed.\n- A vase with second argument a sneeze object (4 or 5) can be created by clip(object_12, sneeze, texture). A clip(action) requires both next(sneeze,texture) and next(12,texture) to be true as preconditions. For our initial next12->8, the promising clip to produce vase12 4 is clip(12,4,8) which additionally requires next4->8. But next4->8 cannot be produced by any applicable wretched in the domain that would change next4->7 -> next4->8 because wretched would need collect(7,o3) and collect(8,o3) with the same o3 (a stupendous object). In the given facts collect7 and collect8 point to different collect targets, so there is no o3 that satisfies both collect7 o3 and collect8 o3; therefore no wretched action can change next4->7 into next4->8. Similarly attempts to route via sneeze 5 run into a symmetric collect mismatch for producing next5->7. The other clip variants either are circular (require next12->7 to create vase12 4) or require impossible intermediate next facts.\n- In short: to get next12->7 you'd need to manufacture either next4->7 (already is) plus vase12 4, or next5->7 plus vase12 5, or a paltry-produced next12->7 that depends on next1->7 \u2014 none of those can be produced from the available collect/spring/stupendous facts and the given operators without assuming next12->7 already holds. Thus next12->7 is not reachable.\n\nConclusion\n- Full goal is unreachable because next object_12 object_7 cannot be made.\n- The 6-action partial plan above achieves the other required next relations (10->6 and 11->8); object_13 already satisfies its target. If you want, I can:\n  - produce the full state after executing the partial plan,\n  - search for any alternative route I might have missed,\n  - or try to find a plan if you change/add a collect/spring/stupendous/sneeze fact."

From the action schemata, only paltry(11, A, 10), memory(11, A, 10), tightfisted(11, A, 10) or wretched(11, ..., 10, ...) can add next with subject 11.\n- memory(11, . , .) requires cats(11) \u2014 cats(11) is not in the initial state and no action ever adds cats facts. So memory(11,...) is impossible.\n- wretched requires sneeze(11) \u2014 sneeze(11) is not in the initial state and no action ever adds sneeze facts. So wretched with subject 11 is impossible.\n- That leaves paltry(11,A,10) and tightfisted(11,A,10). Both require:\n  - hand(11) (we have this), texture(10) (we have), and\n  - vase(11,A) and next(A,10).\n  So we must produce some pair (A) such that both vase(11,A) and next(A,10) can be made.\n- How can vase(11,A) be created? Only clip or sip create vase facts:\n  - sip(11,A,*) requires cats(A) \u2014 there is no cats(A) available for a suitable A (cats exist only for object_0 in the initial state), so sip cannot produce a useful vase(11,A).\n  - clip(11,A,Z) requires next(11,Z) and next(A,Z) (and sneeze(A)). The only initial next with subject 11 is next(11,6). So Z must be 6 to use the existing next(11,6). That requires next(A,6) to exist and sneeze(A) to hold.\n    - The only objects with sneeze in the initial state are A = 3 and A = 4. So A must be 3 or 4 for clip to produce vase(11,A).\n- Can we make next(3,6) or next(4,6) so that clip can produce vase(11,3) or vase(11,4)?\n  - For next(3,6): wretched(3,7,6,X) is the only reasonable way (next(3,7) exists initially). wretched requires collect(7,X) and collect(6,X) for the same X. In the initial state collect(7,1) and collect(6,1) are not both present together with collect(7,1) and collect(6,1)? (Check: collect(7,1) exists but collect(6,1) exists? In this instance collect(6,1) exists yes \u2014 but we must match the collect for 10 as well later; the key failure is for the later requirement explained next.) Even if we could get next(3,6), to obtain next(3,10) (which would be needed to generate next(11,10) via paltry/tightfisted with A=3), wretched(3,6,10,X) would require collect(6,X) and collect(10,X) for the same X. The collects in the initial state are collect(6,1) and collect(10,2); there is no X that makes both collect(6,X) and collect(10,X) true. So next(3,10) cannot be produced.\n  - For next(4,6): similar obstacles arise. You can produce next(4,10) (wretched 4 8 10 2 works because collect(8,2) and collect(10,2) are present and next(4,8) is initial), but to produce a vase(11,4) via clip you would need next(4,6) (to pair with existing next(11,6)) or you would need next(11,10) already (circular), or sip(11,4,10) (which requires cats(4) and cats(4) is not present). There is no way to create next(4,6) because wretched to create next(4,6) would require collect(8,X) and collect(6,X) for same X \u2014 collect(8,2) and collect(6,1) do not share an X.\n- Summary: any attempt to create vase(11,A) either requires a next(11,Z) that doesn\u2019t exist or requires cats(A) that don\u2019t exist. The only available next(11,Z) is Z=6, but producing the corresponding next(A,6) for a sneeze A (3 or 4) runs into an unavoidable collect-mismatch barrier that prevents producing the needed next(A,10) (or next(A,6) when required). Therefore there is no sequence of actions that can produce both vase(11,A) and next(A,10) for any A, and so no action can add next(11,10).\n\nConclusion: the given action set and initial facts do not allow achieving next(11,10). If you want, I can try to produce a minimal proof trace showing the impossibility in a small number of cases (exhaustive check for A in {3,4} with the required collect matches), or I can suggest minimal additions to the initial state that would make next(11,10) achievable (for example, adding cats(4) or a collect that matches collect(10,X) and collect(6,X)). Which would you prefer?"

    "response": "Short answer: No valid plan exists from the given initial facts \u2014 the conjunctive goal (next object_11 object_7 AND next object_12 object_5) cannot be achieved. Below is a concise proof by inspecting every possible way to produce the required next facts and showing at least one required precondition is unattainable.\n\nKey observation: Only these operators can add a next(X,Y) fact:\n- paltry(X,A,Y) adds next(X,Y)\n- sip(X,A,Y) does NOT directly add next (it adds vase)\n- clip(X,A,Y) does NOT directly add next (it adds vase)\n- wretched(X,A,Y,S) adds next(X,Y)\n- memory(X,A,Y) adds next(X,Y)\n- tightfisted(X,A,Y) adds next(X,Y)\n\nSo to get next(12,5) we must use one of paltry, wretched, memory or tightfisted with X = 12 and Y = 5. Examine each case:\n\n1) memory(12, A, 5)\n- Pre: cats(12), spring(A), spring(5), next(12,A).\n- cats(12) is false in the initial state, and no operator ever adds cats facts. So memory cannot be applied with X=12.\n\n2) wretched(12, A, 5, S)\n- Pre: sneeze(12), texture(A), texture(5), stupendous(S), next(12,A), collect(A,S), collect(5,S).\n- sneeze(12) is false in the initial state, and no operator ever adds sneeze facts. So wretched with X=12 cannot be applied.\n\n3) paltry(12, A, 5)\n- Pre: hand(12), cats(A), texture(5), vase(12,A), next(A,5).\n- hand(12) is true and texture(5) is true for some As, but paltry requires vase(12,A). The only operators that can produce vase facts are sip(...) and clip(...). So we must be able to create vase(12,A) first.\n\n4) tightfisted(12, A, 5)\n- Pre: hand(12), sneeze(A), texture(5), next(A,5), vase(12,A).\n- This also requires vase(12,A) and additionally sneeze(A). The only objects with sneeze initially are 3 and 4, and sneeze is not producible by any operator, so tightfisted would demand A be 3 or 4.\n\nThus paltry/tightfisted route reduces to: can we create vase(12,A)? Vase creation operators are:\n\n- clip(12, B, T) creates vase(12,B) but requires sneeze(B) (so B must be 3 or 4) and next(B,T) and next(12,T).\n  - For any such clip we need next(12,T) already true. The only initial next(12,_) is next(12,10), so T would have to be 10. Then clip requires next(B,10). Do we have next(3,10) or next(4,10)? No. Creating next(3,10) or next(4,10) would require a wretched with sneeze 3 or 4 \u2014 that is possible in principle, but wretched also requires specific collect facts (collect(A,S) and collect(B,S)) that are not available (check below), and there is no way to produce the missing collect or sneeze facts. So the needed next(B,10) cannot be obtained.\n\n- sip(12, B, T) creates vase(12,B) but requires cats(B). The only cats present are cats(object_0) (no cats for other objects), so B would have to be object_0. sip further requires next(12,T) and next(0,T). The only next(12,T) initially is T=10, so we would need next(0,10). But next(0,10) cannot be produced: memory(0,5,10) would need spring(10) (not present), wretched(0, ...) would need sneeze(0) (not present), and no operator can produce the missing spring/sneeze/collect facts needed. So sip cannot produce vase(12,0).\n\nIn short, vase(12,A) cannot be made with the available facts and operators; therefore paltry/tightfisted routes to next(12,5) are impossible. Combined with the impossibility of memory/wretched on 12 (missing cats(12) or sneeze(12)), next(12,5) is unreachable.\n\nBecause the goal is conjunctive, if next(12,5) is unreachable the whole goal is unreachable. (For completeness: next(11,7) is also blocked by similar issues \u2014 producing next(11,7) would require creating vase(11,\u00b7) or applying memory/wretched for 11, but cats(11) and sneeze(11) are missing and vase(11,\u00b7) would require producing intermediate next facts or sneeze/cats that cannot be produced.)\n\nConclusion: No valid plan exists from the given initial state to achieve the goal next object_11 object_7 AND next object_12 object_5. If you want, I can:\n- produce a formal proof trace showing each attempted operator and the missing precondition, or\n- search for a plan under relaxed assumptions (e.g., allowing addition of cats or sneeze), or\n- attempt to achieve either goal separately to show which subgoal might be reachable. Which would you like?"

Creating vase(13,c) with a cat as second argument can only be done by sip (clip produces vase(13,s) where s must be a sneeze, but cats are not sneeze). But sip requires both next(13,x) and next(c,x) for some x \u2014 i.e. it already needs next(13,\u00b7) to exist. So paltry would require next(13,\u00b7) to already exist (circular). Thus paltry cannot be used to newly create next(13,9) unless next(13,9) already held.\n\nConsider tightfisted: tightfisted object_13 s 9 would require vase(13,s) for a sneeze s (s is 4 or 5) and next(s,9). The only way to make vase(13,s) is clip, and clip requires next(13,y) and next(s,y) for some y (the texture used by the clip). Initially next(13,7) is the only next with first arg 13, so clip can only create a vase(13,s) using y = 7, i.e. it needs next(s,7). We can make next(4,7) (for s = 4) by wretched(4,8,7,2), so we can get vase(13,4) via clip(13,4,7). After that, tightfisted requires next(4,9) to produce next(13,9). So the question reduces to: can we ever make next(4,9)?\n\nTo add next(4,9) by wretched(4,o1,9,o3) we need:\n- next(4,o1) to exist beforehand, and\n- collect(o1,o3) and collect(9,o3) for the same o3.\nFrom the initial collect facts, collect(9, o3) holds only for o3 = 3 (collect 9 3). So collect(o1,3) must hold. The objects with collect(...,3) are {10, 11, 9} (collect 10 3, 11 3, 9 3). So o1 would need to be one of {10,11,9} and we would need next(4,o1) already. But initially next(4,8) is the only next with first arg 4. Changing next(4,...) is only possible by wretched applied to 4 and each such change requires collect matches that never let 4 reach any of {10,11,9} (the necessary collect pairs for transitioning 4 to those targets are absent). Concretely, the only next targets 4 can initially reach (or be changed to) have collect-to-2 (like 8,7,6), while 9's collect partner is 3 \u2014 there is no sequence of available wretched steps that lets next(4,\u00b7) become 10 or 11 (the only o1 that could pair with 9 via o3=3). Thus next(4,9) cannot be produced; hence tightfisted cannot be used to make next(13,9) after clip(13,4,7).\n\nCombining the two branches above shows there is no way to create the required vase(13,cat) or vase(13,sneeze)+next(sneeze,9) combination without already having next(13,9). Therefore next(object_13, object_9) is unreachable from the given initial state under the available operators.\n\nConclusion\n- A valid plan to achieve next(object_12, object_10) is the three-step sequence above (clip(12,5,11); wretched(5,11,10,3); tightfisted(12,5,10)).\n- There is no valid plan to achieve next(object_13, object_9) from the given initial facts and actions (reason sketched above).\n\nIf you want, I can:\n- produce the plan in the exact [PLAN] format for the part that is achievable, or\n- search again and give a more detailed, step-by-step impossibility proof (or a model search trace showing failure)."

    "response": "I examined whether a plan exists that reaches all three goals {next 12 6, next 13 10, next 14 11} from the given initial facts and the available actions. Short answer: no valid plan can achieve the full goal set. Below is a concise proof (spot-checking the bottleneck that already makes the whole goal unreachable) and some diagnostics that show why.\n\nKey observations about how next facts can be created/changed\n- Only actions that can add a next(X,Y) fact are: paltry(X,\u00b7,Y), wretched(X,\u00b7,Y,\u00b7), memory(X,\u00b7,Y), and tightfisted(X,\u00b7,Y).\n- For X = 12 (we need next 12 6), memory(12,...) is impossible because it requires cats 12 (not present). wretched(12,...) is impossible because it requires sneeze 12 (not present). So the only ways to get next 12 6 are paltry(12,b,6) or tightfisted(12,b,6).\n- Both paltry(12,b,6) and tightfisted(12,b,6) require vase(12,b) to hold before they can add next(12,6).\n\nHow to get vase(12,b)\n- Only sip and clip add vase facts.\n- Both sip and clip for subject 12 require a next(12, d) fact already (their preconditions include next(12,d)). We do have next(12,11) initially, so d=11 is the candidate to use.\n- sip(12,b,11) requires cats b and next b 11. cats are only objects 0 and 1, so b \u2208 {0,1}; this needs next 0 11 or next 1 11. Those next facts cannot be generated: memory(0,\u00b7,11) or memory(1,\u00b7,11) would require spring 11 (not present), and wretched requires sneeze on the subject (0 and 1 are not sneeze). So sip cannot produce vase(12,0) or vase(12,1).\n- clip(12,b,11) requires sneeze b and next b 11. The only sneeze objects are 4 and 5. So b \u2208 {4,5}. next 4 11 cannot be produced given the available collect facts (attempts to make next 4 11 via wretched fail because the needed collect facts are not present). However next 5 11 can be produced: wretched 5 10 11 3 is valid (it requires next 5 10, sneeze 5, textures 10 and 11, stupendous 3, and collect 10 3 & collect 11 3 \u2014 all present) and it yields next 5 11. So:\n  - wretched 5 10 11 3 \u2192 next 5 11\n  - then clip 12 5 11 \u2192 vase 12 5 (and deletes next 12 11)\n\nWhy that still cannot produce next 12 6\n- After creating vase(12,5), paltry(12,5,6) would require cats 5 (not present), so paltry cannot be used with b=5.\n- tightfisted(12,5,6) would require next 5 6 (and sneeze 5, texture 6, and vase 12 5). sneeze 5 and texture 6 are OK, but next 5 6 is not present and cannot be created: memory would need cats 5 (not present), and wretched(5,...) to produce next 5 6 would require collect 6 3 which is false in the given collects. So next 5 6 is unattainable.\n- Therefore, even though we can create vase(12,5), neither paltry(12,5,6) nor tightfisted(12,5,6) is possible; and the other paltry/tightfisted variants (with b \u2208 {0,1,4}) are impossible due to cats or sneeze / next precondition failures explained above.\n\nConclusion\n- next(12,6) is unreachable from the given initial facts and actions. Because that single conjunct is unreachable, the whole goal set {next 12 6, next 13 10, next 14 11} is unreachable.\n- (By symmetry / similar reasoning you can check next 13 10 and next 14 11; but testing one unreachable conjunct is sufficient to declare the whole conjunction unreachable.)\n\nIf you want, I can:\n- produce the short feasible sub-sequence I found (wretched 5 10 11 3; clip 12 5 11) to show reachable intermediate facts, or\n- suggest minimal changes to make the goal reachable (for example: make cats 5 true, or add a collect 6 3, or add spring 11, etc.), and then produce a full plan under those changed facts. Which would you prefer?"

There is no cats(object_13) in your initial facts, so memory cannot produce next(13,10).\n- wretched requires the subject to be a sneeze object; object_13 is not a sneeze object in the initial facts, so wretched cannot produce next(13,10).\n\n3) Examine paltry producing next(13,10)\n- paltry(13, o1, 10) would require cats(o1) and next(o1,10).\n- In your initial facts, cats is true only for object_0 and object_1. So o1 would have to be object_1.\n- That would require next(1,10). But object_1\u2019s next is initially 9, and the only action that can change next for object_1 is memory (which only swaps next between the two spring objects present, 6 and 9). There is no way to make next(1,10) (10 is not a spring), so paltry cannot be used to produce next(13,10).\n\n4) Examine tightfisted producing next(13,10)\n- tightfisted(13, s, 10) requires:\n  - hand(13) \u2014 true,\n  - sneeze(s) \u2014 so s must be one of the sneeze objects (4 or 5),\n  - texture(10) \u2014 true,\n  - next(s,10) \u2014 and\n  - vase(13,s).\n- Which sneeze s have next(s,10) initially? Only s = 5 has next(5,10).\n  So we would need vase(13,5).\n- How can we make vase(13,5)? The only actions that add vase facts are clip and sip.\n  - sip(13,5, t) requires cats(5) \u2014 false (cats exists only for objects 0 and 1), so sip cannot create vase(13,5).\n  - clip(13,5,t) requires next(13,t) and next(5,t) for some t. For t = 10, that requires next(13,10) already (circular). For t = 9, that requires next(13,9) (not present initially) and next(5,9) (which can be created), but producing next(13,9) faces the same kinds of obstructions as producing next(13,10) (memory/wretched/paltry all fail or are circular).\n- Therefore vase(13,5) cannot be produced from the available preconditions without already having next(13,10) (circular), so tightfisted cannot produce next(13,10).\n\n5) Conclusion\n- None of the actions that can add a next fact can produce next(13,10) from the given initial facts. Because next(13,10) is impossible, the joint goal requiring next(12,10), next(13,10), next(14,9) is unachievable from the provided initial state and available actions.\n\nIf you want, I can:\n- try to find a reachable subset of the goals and produce a plan for those, or\n- propose minimal changes to the initial facts (e.g., add cats(object_13) or a suitable next link or a vase(13,5) seed) that would make the overall goal reachable, and then produce a plan. Which would you prefer?"

The only actions that can add a next relation for an object X are paltry, memory, wretched and tightfisted. To get next object_14 object_7 we would need one of those to add next(14,7):\n\n- memory requires cats object_14 \u2014 cats is only true for object_0 in your initial state, so memory cannot target object_14.\n- wretched requires sneeze object_14 \u2014 sneeze is only true for objects 3 and 4, so wretched cannot target object_14.\n- paltry requires vase object_14 object_1 and next object_1 object_2 where object_2 would be 7; paltry also requires cats object_1 \u2014 cats is only object_0, so paltry would need object_1 = object_0 and hence requires next object_0 object_7. But memory (the only action that can change next object_0 ...) can only toggle next object_0 between object_8 and object_5 (springs are only object_5 and object_8). So next object_0 object_7 cannot be produced.\n- tightfisted could make next object_14 object_7 if there is vase object_14 Y and next Y object_7 and sneeze Y holds. The only sneeze objects are 3 and 4. So Y must be 3 or 4. That requires creating a vase object_14 3 (or vase object_14 4) and also getting next 3 7 (or next 4 7). For next 3 7 we can produce it (3 is in the collect-group that lets wretched move 3 among {5,6,7}), but creating vase object_14 3 would require clip or sip which need a matching next(14, Z) and next(3, Z) for the same Z \u2014 but 3 can only reach Z in the {5,6,7} group while 14 initially points to 9 (which is in the {8,9,10} group); there is no available action that moves next(14,\u00b7) into the {5,6,7} group (wretched requires sneeze(14) false; memory requires cats(14) false). Because the collect sets split the objects into two disjoint groups ({5,6,7} and {8,9,10}) and 14 is initially in the second group, there is no way to get 14 into the first group so tightfisted cannot be applied with a sneeze-object (3) that has next to 7.\n\nTaken together, no action sequence can produce next object_14 object_7 from the given initial facts. In short: 14 cannot be operated on by memory or wretched (their preconditions block 14), and the only path that could produce next(14,7) would require moving 14 into the collect-group of 7 (or having next0 7), both of which are impossible under your initial facts and available actions.\n\nIf you want, I can:\n- produce the described 12-step plan formatted in the exact [PLAN] form you used; or\n- suggest minimal changes to the initial facts (for example: make cats object_14 true, or add collect object_9 object_1 so that wretched can move next(4) into the other collect-group) that would make next object_14 object_7 achievable, and then produce a full plan that achieves all four goals. Which would you prefer?"

The operators that add a next fact for an object a are: paltry(a, ...), memory(a, ...), wretched(a, ...), tightfisted(a, ...).\n- memory requires cats(a). object_14 is not a cats object (only object_0 and object_1 are cats). So memory cannot change next(14,*).\n- wretched requires sneeze(a). object_14 is not sneeze (only object_4 and object_5 are sneeze). So wretched cannot change next(14,*).\n- That leaves paltry and tightfisted. Both require an existing vase(14, b) to be present (paltry requires vase(14,b); tightfisted requires vase(14,b) too). vases can only be created by sip or clip. Both sip and clip require next(14,c) to already hold (clip needs both next(14,c) and next(b,c); sip needs next(14,c) and next(b,c)) \u2014 so to create a vase for 14 you already need a next for 14. In short, creating vase(14, b) requires that 14 already has a next, so you cannot bootstrap a new next for 14 unless you already had a different next to use. That leaves the one initial next(14,7) as the only option to start.\n- If you try to use tightfisted(14,b,10) (to get next(14,10)), b must be a sneeze object (only 4 or 5). Object_4 cannot ever have next(...,10) because all wretched transitions for object_4 only move it among objects that collect the same d (object_4\u2019s initial target collects d=2), and object_10 belongs to the collect-d=3 group \u2014 so there is no sequence that makes next(4,10). Thus b=4 cannot be used to place 10.\n- b=5 could reach 10 (wretched can change next(5,9) \u2192 next(5,10)), but to invoke tightfisted(14,5,10) you need vase(14,5). Creating vase(14,5) by clip(14,5,c) requires both next(14,c) and next(5,c) to be true for some c. Initially next(14,7) and next(5,9) are different, and we cannot change next(14,*) before having a vase(14,*) (circular dependency). There is no way to break this circularity because 14 is neither sneeze nor cats and cannot be operated on by wretched or memory to change its next.\n- Therefore there is no valid sequence of the available actions that yields next(14,10) from the given initial facts.\n\nSummary\n- The plan above achieves: next(12,11), next(13,8), next(15,9).\n- next(14,10) is unreachable under the given initial facts and operators (reason sketched above).\n\nIf you want, I can:\n- produce a step-by-step state trace showing the relevant facts after each action, or\n- try variations (e.g., different intermediate choices) to confirm the impossibility of next(14,10) more exhaustively."

Reason (sketch):\n\n- The only actions that can add a next(h, t) where the first argument is a hand (like object_12) are paltry(...) and tightfisted(...).\n  - paltry(h,c,t) requires vase(h,c) and next(c,t) with c being a cat (the only cat is object_0). So paltry could make next(12,6) only if next(0,6) existed.\n    - next(0,*) can only be changed by memory(0,s1,s2), and memory only swaps between spring values (object_5 and object_8). So next(0,6) can never be produced.\n  - tightfisted(h,s,t) requires vase(h,s) where s is a sneeze and next(s,t). So to get next(12,6) we would need some sneeze s with next(s,6) and vase(12,s).\n    - The only sneeze that can get next(...,6) from its initial next value is object_3 (initially next(3,7)) via wretched(3,7,6,1) because both collect(7,1) and collect(6,1) exist and stupendous object_1 exists. So next(3,6) is attainable.\n    - However, to get vase(12,3) we would need to run clip(12,3,t) for some texture t where next(12,t) and next(3,t) are both true. Initially next(12,8) and next(3,7). There is no available sequence that makes next(3,8) (changing 3 from 7\u21928 would require collect(7,k) and collect(8,k) for the same k, but collect(7,1) and collect(8,2) use different stupenda), and there is no way to change next(12,8) into next(12,7) without already having a vase(12,3) or next(0,7) (next(0,7) is impossible for the reason above). This gives a circular impossibility: you need vase(12,3) to make next(12,6), but all ways to make vase(12,3) require a next equality that cannot be produced with available collect/stupendous constraints.\n- Therefore next(12,6) is unreachable.\n\nConclusion\n\n- The 8-step plan above achieves next(13,5) and next(15,8) while preserving/using the initially-true next(11,6) and next(14,5). After those steps you will have:\n  - next(11,6) (unchanged),\n  - next(12,6) \u2014 cannot be produced (unreachable),\n  - next(13,5) \u2014 produced,\n  - next(14,5) (unchanged),\n  - next(15,8) \u2014 produced.\n\nIf you want, I can:\n- try to search exhaustively for any more exotic plan (but the argument above shows a structural impossibility for next(12,6)), or\n- produce the same plan in a different order, or\n- show a step-by-step state trace verifying preconditions/effects for each action in the plan."

    "response": "I checked the operators, the initial facts and your goal. I can produce a short valid partial plan (it achieves next object_13 object_6) but the remaining goal conjuncts (next object_14 object_9, next object_15 object_9, next object_16 object_8) cannot be achieved from the given initial facts with the available operators \u2014 there is a structural obstacle I explain after the plan.\n\nValid partial plan (from your second [STATEMENT]) that makes next object_13 object_6:\n1) clip object_13 object_4 object_8\n   - preconditions satisfied: hand object_13, sneeze object_4, texture object_8, next object_4 object_8, next object_13 object_8\n   - effect: adds vase object_13 object_4 and deletes next object_13 object_8\n2) wretched object_4 object_8 object_6 object_2\n   - preconditions satisfied after step (1): sneeze object_4, texture object_8, texture object_6, stupendous object_2, next object_4 object_8, collect object_8 object_2, collect object_6 object_2\n   - effect: adds next object_4 object_6 and deletes next object_4 object_8\n3) tightfisted object_13 object_4 object_6\n   - preconditions satisfied after (1)+(2): hand object_13, sneeze object_4, texture object_6, next object_4 object_6, vase object_13 object_4\n   - effect: adds next object_13 object_6 and deletes vase object_13 object_4\n\nAfter these three actions next object_13 object_6 holds (and next object_12 object_10 was already true initially).\n\nWhy the other goal facts are unreachable (informal proof sketch)\n- To get next A 9 (A = object_14 or object_15) by paltry/tightfisted you need a vase A B and next B 9 (the only B with next B 9 initially are object_0 and object_5). Creating vase A 0 or vase A 5 requires a clip or sip that itself requires next A C and next B C for some common C. For B = object_0 the only C with next object_0 C is C = object_9; for B = object_5 the only C with next object_5 C is C = object_9. So to create vase A {0|5} by clip/sip you would already need next A 9 (circular). There is no other operator that can create a vase A {0|5} without that circular requirement. In short: you cannot produce the needed vase(A,B) with B pointing to 9 unless A already points to 9 \u2014 circular, so next object_14 object_9 and next object_15 object_9 cannot be achieved.\n\n- For next object_16 object_8: an analogous obstruction arises. To set next object_16 object_8 you need (via paltry/tightfisted) a vase object_16 B and next B 8. To create vase object_16 B by clip you need next object_16 C and next B C for some C. Initially next object_16 C is only C=object_11, but there is no B with next B object_11 in the initial facts, so you cannot create any vase object_16 B using clip with C=object_11. Other routes to change next object_16 first are not available either (wretched requires sneeze on the source node, but object_16 has no sneeze fact). Thus object_16 cannot be redirected to object_8 under the available operators and initial facts.\n\nConclusion and options\n- A full plan that achieves all five goal conjuncts does not exist with the given initial facts and operators.\n- If you want, I can:\n  - produce only the maximal achievable plan (I already gave the three actions to establish next object_13 object_6), or\n  - try again if you allow adding a small extra initial fact (for example adding sneeze or a suitable next or collect fact for a specific object), or\n  - show a more detailed step-by-step state trace for the partial plan I gave.\n\nWhich of those would you like?"

So to get vase(h,s) (and so to use tightfisted to add next(h,t)), either:\n    - the hand already has next(h,t) (then clip would trivially be possible), or\n    - a sneeze s can have its next changed (by wretched) to t while the hand already has next(h,t) \u2014 circular, or\n    - you can otherwise create vase(h,cats) and use paltry (see below).\n  - paltry(h,c,t) requires vase(h,c) and next(c,t) (cats c) and then it adds next(h,t). vase(h,c) can only be created by sip(h,c,t) which requires next(h,t) and next(c,t) (so again sip needs the hand already to have next(h,t)). So paltry also cannot create a new next(h,t) unless some vase exists already or the hand already has that next.\n- In short: to create a new next for a hand to texture t you must either already have next(hand,t) or rely on a sneeze s that currently (or can be made to) have next s = t and a vase between the hand and s. But creating that vase between hand and sneeze by clip requires the hand to already share the same next t with the sneeze. So there is a circular dependency: you cannot create a hand->t next from nothing unless a reachable sneeze can be changed to a texture t that matches an existing hand next, or the hand already has t.\n\nApplication to object_12 and object_13\n- object_12 and object_13 have initial next -> object_7 (next object_12 object_7, next object_13 object_7).\n- The only sneeze that has next -> object_7 initially is sneeze object_3 (next object_3 object_7). So clip could create vase between hand12/13 and sneeze3 (since both share texture 7), but that only yields a vase between the hand and sneeze3; to use tightfisted to give the hand next -> object_8, sneeze3 would have to have next object_8 at the time of tightfisted.\n- Can sneeze3 be changed to next object_8 by wretched? No. wretched changes a sneeze\u2019s next only between textures that are collected by the same stupendous object. For sneeze3 (current t1 = 7) the textures it can be moved to are those that share a collect with the same stupendous id as 7. In the initial facts 7 is collected by stupendous object_1 (collect object_7 object_1). The other textures collected by object_1 are {5,6,7}. Texture 8 is collected only by stupendous object_2 (collect object_8 object_2). There is no stupendous object that collects both 7 and 8, so wretched cannot change sneeze3\u2019s next to 8. Therefore sneeze3 cannot become a source with next = 8, so tightfisted can never produce next(hand12,8) or next(hand13,8) from vase(hand,sneeze3).\n- There is another sneeze (object_4) with next object_4 -> object_8, and object_4 can be moved between 8 and 9 (because collect 8 and collect 9 share stupendous object_2). That lets us use sneeze4 to get some hands to texture 8 \u2014 but clip requires the hand already to share the same texture as the sneeze at the time of clip, and no hand initially shares texture 8. So for hands that start with texture 7 (object_12 and object_13) there is no sequence of allowed operations that gets them to 8.\n\nConclusion: Because object_12 and object_13 cannot be made to have next ... object_8 under the given operators and initial facts, the full goal set {next object_11 object_5, next object_12 object_8, next object_13 object_8, next object_14 object_7, next object_15 object_10, next object_16 object_8} is unattainable.\n\nPartial / maximal achievable subset\nThe other goal facts are achievable (next object_14 object_7 and next object_15 object_10 are already true initially). It is possible to achieve next object_16 object_8 and next object_11 object_5. Below is a valid plan that achieves those two and leaves object_12 and object_13 unchanged (they remain next -> object_7).\n\nPlan that achieves the achievable goals (changes shown):\n1. wretched object_4 object_8 object_9 object_2\n   - (makes next object_4 object_9; uses collect 8 & 9 with stupendous object_2)\n2. clip object_16 object_4 object_9\n   - (creates vase object_16 object_4, deletes next object_16 object_9)\n3. clip object_11 object_4 object_9\n   - (creates vase object_11 object_4, deletes next object_11 object_9)\n4. wretched object_4 object_9 object_8 object_2\n   - (restores next object_4 object_8)\n5. tightfisted object_16 object_4 object_8\n   - (uses vase(16,4) and next(4,8) to add next(16,8))\n6. tightfisted object_11 object_4 object_8\n   - (uses vase(11,4) and next(4,8) to add next(11,8))\n7. sip object_11 object_0 object_8\n   - (uses next(11,8) and next(0,8) to create vase(11,0) and deletes next(11,8))\n8. memory object_0 object_8 object_5\n   - (changes next(0,8) -> next(0,5))\n9. paltry object_11 object_0 object_5\n   - (uses vase(11,0) and next(0,5) to create next(11,5))\n\nAfter step 9 you have:\n- next object_11 object_5 (goal achieved)\n- next object_16 object_8 (goal achieved)\n- next object_14 object_7 and next object_15 object_10 were already true and stay true\n- object_12 and object_13 remain with next -> object_7 (so their goal next -> object_8 is not achieved)\n\nIf you want I can:\n- produce that plan in a slightly different ordering or with full intermediate state after each step;\n- try to find any alternative approach if you can change/relax initial facts (for example, if collect facts or stupendous facts change) or add additional available actions; or\n- attempt a shortest plan to achieve the maximal achievable subset.\n\nWhich would you like next?"

However, the other required changes (next object_13 object_7, next object_14 object_5, next object_15 object_8) cannot be achieved under the action precondition/effect constraints and the available collect/spring/stupendous facts \u2014 I explain why after the plan.\n\nPlan fragment that achieves next object_11 object_5\n1. memory object_0 object_5 object_8\n   - pre: cats object_0, spring object_5, spring object_8, next object_0 object_5 (all true initially)\n   - effect: next object_0 object_8 becomes true (next 0 5 is deleted)\n2. sip object_11 object_0 object_8\n   - pre: hand object_11, cats object_0, texture object_8, next object_11 object_8 (true initially), next object_0 object_8 (made true by step 1)\n   - effect: vase object_11 object_0 becomes true; next object_11 object_8 is deleted\n3. memory object_0 object_8 object_5\n   - pre: cats object_0, spring object_8, spring object_5, next object_0 object_8 (true from step 1)\n   - effect: restores next object_0 object_5 (next 0 8 deleted)\n4. paltry object_11 object_0 object_5\n   - pre: hand object_11, cats object_0, texture object_5, vase object_11 object_0 (from step 2), next object_0 object_5 (restored by step 3)\n   - effect: next object_11 object_5 is added (goal satisfied for object_11)\n\nNotes:\n- After step 2 next object_11 object_8 is deleted; step 4 produces next object_11 object_5, so the net effect is to replace 11->8 with 11->5 as required.\n\nWhich goals are already satisfied\n- next object_12 object_9 is true initially; no action needed.\n- next object_16 object_6 is true initially; no action needed.\n\nWhy the remaining goals appear unreachable\nI checked the ways actions can add or move next facts for a hand H and found blocking constraints:\n\n- To add next H T for a hand H you only have:\n  - paltry(H, cats=object_0, T) which requires vase H object_0 and next object_0 T, or\n  - tightfisted(H, s, T) which requires vase H s and next s T.\n  - (clip and sip only create vase facts, and wretched/memory only change next for sneeze or cats subjects respectively.)\n\n- So to set next object_13 object_7 we must (a) produce a vase for hand 13 with some s, and (b) have next s object_7 for that s. The only sneeze objects that can be used as s are object_3 and object_4. I examined the available wretched moves that can change next for object_3 or object_4, and the collect/stupendous facts prevent producing next 3 10 (needed to clip into a vase matching next 13 10) or producing next 4 7 (needed later to use tightfisted). Concretely:\n  - You can make a vase for 13 by using clip(13, s, t), but that requires next 13 t and next s t to be the same t. next 13 is 10 initially; turning next s to 10 is possible for s=4 (wretched 4 9 10 2 can produce next 4 10), so clip 13 4 10 can create vase 13 4 \u2014 but then to get next 13 7 you would need next 4 7 (so tightfisted 13 4 7), and there is no wretched sequence (given the collect/stupendous pairs) that can make next 4 7. The collect facts pair textures with two different stupendous objects in ways that block the required conversion.\n  - paltry(13, object_0,7) would need vase 13 0; creating vase 13 0 via sip or clip requires a common texture t shared by next 13 t and next 0 t, but next 13 t=10 and next 0 is only 5 or 8 (memory can only toggle between 5 and 8) so no t in common \u2014 so vase 13 0 can't be produced that way.\n\n- Similar blocking applies for next object_14 object_5:\n  - You can create vase 14 4 using clip(14,4,9) (since next 14 9 and next 4 9 are true), and you can change next 4 to other textures via wretched, but getting next 4 to 5 is blocked by the collect/stupendous pairings (collect 9 pairs with stup=2 while collect 5 pairs with stup=1), so you cannot obtain next 4 5 to allow tightfisted(14,4,5). Creating vase 14 0 to use paltry(14,0,5) is blocked for the same common-texture reason explained above.\n\n- For next object_15 object_8:\n  - A promising route is to create vase 15 3 via clip(15,3,6) after making next 3 6 (wretched 3 5 6 1 works), so vase 15 3 becomes possible. But then to get next 15 8 via tightfisted(15,3,8) you need next 3 8, and there is no sequence of wretched moves (consistent with the collect/stupendous facts) that converts next 3 to 8. Other alternatives to create vase 15 with different s fail for similar reasons (lack of required common textures or incompatible collect/stupendous pairings).\n\nConclusion\n- Achievable from your second initial state:\n  - next object_11 object_5 (plan above),\n  - next object_12 object_9 (already true),\n  - next object_16 object_6 (already true).\n\n- Unachievable under the given action definitions and initial facts:\n  - next object_13 object_7,\n  - next object_14 object_5,\n  - next object_15 object_8.\n\nIf you want, I can:\n- produce a complete plan that achieves the three reachable goal items (including no-op steps for those already true), or\n- try alternative changes to the initial facts (e.g., add/alter a collect or stupendous or a next fact) to make the unreachable goals attainable and then produce a full plan for that revised instance.

    "response": "Summary:\n\n- First problem: the plan you gave is valid and achieves the goal. I checked every step \u2014 all preconditions are met when the action is applied, effects are applied, and after the last action the required next facts are true.\n\n- Second problem: you supplied the initial state and goal but no concrete plan. I can attempt to synthesize a plan for that instance; do you want me to search for any valid plan, a short plan (minimize number of actions), or a particular style (reuse patterns from your first plan)?\n\nDetails for the first problem (concise trace / key points)\n- Initial next facts (relevant): next(0,6), next(1,9), next(12,9), next(13,10), next(14,11), next(15,10), next(16,7), next(17,7), next(4,6), next(5,10).\n- I applied the actions in the order you gave. All preconditions were satisfied at the time each action was executed (I verified hand/sneeze/cats/texture/next/vase/collect/stupendous requirements where relevant).\n- The actions that create required next facts:\n  - next(12,6) is produced by paltry object_12 object_1 object_6 in your plan.\n  - next(15,6) is produced by paltry object_15 object_1 object_6.\n  - next(14,8) is produced by tightfisted object_14 object_4 object_8 after wretched actions that produced next(4,8).\n  - next(16,9) is produced by paltry/tightfisted sequence that first created vase16/next1 pairs then paltry(16,1,9).\n- After the final action (paltry object_16 object_1 object_9) the six goal next facts are present:\n  next(12,6), next(13,10), next(14,8), next(15,6), next(16,9), next(17,7).\n- Therefore your plan is valid for the first instance.\n\nAbout the second instance\n- You gave the initial facts and the goal:\n  goal: next(12,8), next(13,10), next(14,9), next(15,11), next(16,7), next(17,7).\n- You left [PLAN] empty. I can synthesize a plan for this instance if you want. Because the domain has nontrivial constraints (vase facts must be created before paltry/tightfisted use them; wretched can only change next for sneeze objects 4/5; memory can only operate on cat objects 0/1; collect/stupendous constraints restrict which wretched transitions are possible), an automated search is most reliable.\n\nOptions I can do next\n- Try to find any valid plan (breadth-first or heuristic search).\n- Try to find a short plan (optimize for fewest steps).\n- Step through interactively: I propose candidate subgoals and you confirm preferred intermediate targets.\n\nWhich would you like me to do? If you want a plan, tell me whether to optimize for brevity or just for any valid solution, and I will produce the action sequence."

    "response": "I examined the available operators and the second problem instance (the second [STATEMENT]) and checked whether a sequence of actions can achieve the goal next facts. Conclusion: the goal is not reachable from the given initial state with the actions you provided. Below is a focused explanation why (the critical obstruction is object_13).\n\nKey observations about which operators can create next facts for a hand (object_i that has hand ... in the initial facts):\n- Operators that can add a next X Y are: paltry (adds next hand cat_target), tightfisted (adds next hand using a sneeze), memory (adds next for a cat), and wretched (adds next for a sneeze).\n- memory only works on cats, wretched only on sneeze objects. So to produce next for a hand (object_13) we must use paltry or tightfisted.\n\nTo get next object_13 object_9, either\n- paltry(13, c, 9) must be applied, which requires a vase(13, c) and next(c,9), or\n- tightfisted(13, s, 9) must be applied, which requires a vase(13, s) and next(s,9) (s must be a sneeze).\n\nCheck each possibility against the initial facts and the available means to create the required vase facts:\n\n1) paltry(13, c, 9):\n- The only cat with next(...,9) initially is object_0 (next object_0 object_9). So c would have to be object_0.\n- paltry also requires vase(13,0) to exist before paltry.\n- vase facts can only be created by sip (creates vase hand cat) or clip (creates vase hand sneeze).\n- To get vase(13,0) by sip we'd need a time when next(13, t) and next(0, t) both hold for some t. But next(0,9) and next(13,8) initially differ (9 vs 8). There is no available operator that can change a cat's next to 8 (cats can only be changed by memory, which only toggles between springs 6 and 9 here), so we cannot make next(0,8). Thus vase(13,0) cannot be produced by sip. clip cannot produce vase(13,0) because clip produces vase(hand, sneeze), not vase(hand, cat). Therefore paltry(13,0,9) is impossible to enable.\n\n2) tightfisted(13, s, 9):\n- s must be a sneeze object that can have next(...,9). The sneeze objects present are object_4 and object_5. Only sneeze object_5's collect group contains 9 (sneeze 5 can have next 9,10,11 via wretched). Sneeze 4's group is {6,7,8} and cannot become 9.\n- So s would have to be 5; tightfisted requires vase(13,5) and next(5,9).\n- To get vase(13,5) we can only use clip (creates vase(hand,sneeze)) or sip (creates vase(hand,cat) which is the wrong second-argument type). clip(13,5,t) requires next(13,t) and next(5,t) for the same t. But sneeze 5 can never have next = 8 (its allowed values are {9,10,11}), while next(13,...) is initially 8. So there is no t such that next(13,t) and next(5,t) can both hold, so vase(13,5) cannot be produced by clip. sip cannot produce vase(13,5) because sip produces vase(hand,cat). Hence vase(13,5) cannot be created.\n\nSince both ways to create next(13,9) (paltry or tightfisted) require a vase fact that cannot be produced from the given initial facts and available operators, next object_13 object_9 is unattainable. Because achieving that single goal literal is impossible, the full goal set is unattainable from the given initial state.\n\nIf you want, I can:\n- show a maximal partial plan that achieves the other goal literals that are reachable; or\n- suggest minimal changes to the initial facts (for example, allow a cat to have next 8 at some point or add a collect mapping that lets a sneeze take value 8) that would make the overall goal reachable; or\n- search again if you intended a different initial state. Which would you prefer?"

    "response": "No \u2014 the goal next object_11 object_9 is not achievable from the given initial facts. Reason:\n\n1. Which actions can add next object_11 object_9?\n   - paltry(h0,h1,h2) can add next h0 h2; to get next object_11 object_9 we would need paltry object_11 object_1 object_9.\n   - tightfisted(h0,s1,t2) can add next h0 t2; to get next object_11 object_9 we would need tightfisted object_11 object_1 object_9.\n   - memory/wretched could add a next with a different first argument, but they require the first argument to be cats or sneeze; object_11 is only a hand in the initial state, so memory and wretched cannot produce next facts whose first argument is object_11.\n\n2. Both paltry and tightfisted require vase object_11 object_1 as a precondition (paltry requires vase object_11 object_1; tightfisted requires vase object_11 object_1). So to create next object_11 object_9 we must first have vase object_11 object_1.\n\n3. The only actions that can create vase object_11 object_1 are sip or clip with arguments that produce vase object_11 object_1:\n   - sip object_11 object_1 object_9 would create vase object_11 object_1, but sip requires next object_11 object_9 as a precondition (so it needs the goal already).\n   - clip object_11 object_1 object_9 would create vase object_11 object_1, but clip requires next object_11 object_9 as a precondition as well.\n   (No other action creates vase facts.)\n\n4. Therefore vase object_11 object_1 can only be made by actions that themselves require next object_11 object_9. That is a circular dependency: to make next object_11 object_9 we need vase object_11 object_1, but to make vase object_11 object_1 we need next object_11 object_9. No sequence of actions can break that cycle from the given initial facts.\n\nYou can verify there is a plausible sub-step (memory object_1 object_8 object_9) that would produce next object_1 object_9 (since next object_1 object_8 exists), but that alone does not remove the circularity because the vase fact is still missing.\n\nIf you want a reachable plan I can propose minimal changes to the initial state that allow a plan. For example:\n- Add vase object_11 object_1 to the initial facts; then do\n  1) memory object_1 object_8 object_9 (creates next object_1 object_9)\n  2) paltry object_11 object_1 object_9 (creates next object_11 object_9)\nIf you prefer a different minimal modification, tell me which facts you're willing to add or which actions to allow, and I'll produce a concrete plan."
