    "response": "Short answer:\n- Under the first initial state (where next object_1 object_6 is true) your 4-step plan is valid and achieves the goal next object_8 object_6.\n- Under the second initial state (where next object_1 object_7 is true but next object_1 object_6 is not), the plan is not valid: the very first step fails because memory object_1 object_6 object_7 requires next object_1 object_6, which is false.\n\nWhy the second initial state fails (details):\n- memory object_1 object_6 object_7 requires: cats object_1 (true), spring object_6 (true), spring object_7 (true), and next object_1 object_6. The last fact is missing in the second initial state, so that first action is not applicable.\n\nMinimal fix for the second initial state:\n- A working 3-step plan (valid under the second initial state) is:\n  1) sip object_8 object_1 object_7\n  2) memory object_1 object_7 object_6\n  3) paltry object_8 object_1 object_6\n- Reason: sip creates vase object_8 object_1 (and deletes next object_8 object_7); memory then turns next object_1 object_7 into next object_1 object_6; paltry then uses vase and next object_1 object_6 to establish next object_8 object_6.\n\nIf you want, I can (a) simulate the full states after each step for either initial state, or (b) search for other alternative plans. Which would you prefer?"
