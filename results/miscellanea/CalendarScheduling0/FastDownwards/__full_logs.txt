HUMAN-SPECIFICATION
------------------------------
You need to schedule a meeting for Michelle, Steven and Jerry for one hour between the work hours of 9:00 to 17:00 on Monday. Here are the existing schedules for everyone during the day: Michelle has meetings on Monday during 11:00 to 12:00; Steven has blocked their calendar on Monday during 9:00 to 9:30, 11:30 to 12:00, 13:30 to 14:00, 15:30 to 16:00; Jerry has blocked their calendar on Monday during 9:00 to 9:30, 10:00 to 11:00, 11:30 to 12:30, 13:00 to 14:30, 15:30 to 16:00, 16:30 to 17:00; Find a time that works for everyone's schedule and constraints.

FINAL-PLAN
------------------------------
I don't have Michelle/Steven/Jerry's availability data in this chat. Please provide each agent's available one-hour start times on Monday between 09:00 and 17:00 (last allowed start is 16:00). Example format:

- avail_michelle: 09:00, 10:00, 14:00, 15:00
- avail_steven: 10:00, 11:00, 15:00, 16:00
- avail_jerry: 09:00, 10:00, 15:00

Remember: treat any natural-language preference as a hard constraint (only list times that are actually acceptable). Once you provide those three lists I will compute the intersection, pick the earliest common slot, and produce the requested FastDownwards-compatible PDDL domain and problem (or an infeasible problem if no common slot exists).
