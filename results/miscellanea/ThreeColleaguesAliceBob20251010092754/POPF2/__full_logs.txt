HUMAN-SPECIFICATION
------------------------------
Three colleagues — Alice, Bob, and Carol — need to schedule a 30-minute meeting on Tuesday, Oct 21. Their availabilities are as follows: Alice: Available from 09:00–11:00 in the morning and 13:00–16:00 in the afternoon. Bob: Available from 10:30–12:00 in the late morning and 14:00–15:30 in the afternoon. Carol: Available from 09:30–10:30, 11:00–12:30, and 15:00–17:00. Find the earliest 30-minute time slot when all three are available. If multiple slots work, choose the one that minimizes interruption to Bob’s morning schedule.

================================================================================


FINAL-PLAN
------------------------------
I don’t have the three participants’ availability lists yet. Please provide Alice, Bob and Carol’s Tuesday Oct 21 availability as 30‑minute slots so I can build the PDDL. To avoid ambiguity, give:

- Timezone (e.g., America/New_York)
- Times in 24h format and aligned to 30‑minute boundaries, e.g.:
  - Alice: 09:00-09:30, 10:30-11:00, 14:00-14:30
  - Bob:   08:30-09:00, 09:00-09:30, 13:30-14:00
  - Carol: 09:00-09:30, 13:30-14:00
- If you want “Bob’s morning” defined specially, state its exact window (default I will use 08:00–12:00).

Also confirm you want the natural‑language tie‑breaking rule treated as a strict constraint: choose the earliest common 30‑minute slot that overlaps all three, and if multiple such slots exist prefer the one that minimizes disruption to Bob’s morning (i.e., choose later-starting morning slots over earlier ones, or prefer an afternoon slot if that reduces interference with Bob’s contiguous morning availability). If that is OK I will produce a POPF2‑compatible PDDL domain and problem with timed facts encoding the provided slots and a planning goal that selects the required meeting time.
