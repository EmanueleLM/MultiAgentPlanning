HUMAN-SPECIFICATION
------------------------------
Three colleagues — Alice, Bob, and Carol — need to schedule a 30-minute meeting on Tuesday, Oct 21. Their availabilities are as follows: Alice: Available from 09:00–11:00 in the morning and 13:00–16:00 in the afternoon. Bob: Available from 10:30–12:00 in the late morning and 14:00–15:30 in the afternoon. Carol: Available from 09:30–10:30, 11:00–12:30, and 15:00–17:00. Find the earliest 30-minute time slot when all three are available. If multiple slots work, choose the one that minimizes interruption to Bob’s morning schedule.
