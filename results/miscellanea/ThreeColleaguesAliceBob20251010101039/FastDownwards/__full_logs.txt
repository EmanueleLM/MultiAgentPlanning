HUMAN-SPECIFICATION
------------------------------
Three colleagues — Alice, Bob, and Carol — need to schedule a 30-minute meeting on Tuesday, Oct 21. Their availabilities are as follows: Alice: Available from 09:00–11:00 in the morning and 13:00–16:00 in the afternoon. Bob: Available from 10:30–12:00 in the late morning and 14:00–15:30 in the afternoon. Carol: Available from 09:30–10:30, 11:00–12:30, and 15:00–17:00. Find the earliest 30-minute time slot when all three are available. If multiple slots work, choose the one that minimizes interruption to Bob’s morning schedule.

NATURAL-PLAN sas_plan_0
------------------------------
1) advance t0 -> t12  
   - Move the current time pointer from t0 (09:00 on 2025-10-21) to t12 (15:00 on 2025-10-21).  
   - Effect: current time is now 15:00. (Advance spans 6 hours forward in the schedule.)

2) schedule-no-interrupt t12  
   - Schedule the 30-minute meeting at t12, i.e., starting 15:00 and ending 15:30 on 2025-10-21.  
   - Preconditions satisfied: Alice, Bob, and Carol are all free at 15:00; the slot is not in Bob’s "morning" window, so no interruption acknowledgement is needed.  
   - Effect: meeting is scheduled at 15:00–15:30.

Result: The meeting is scheduled on 2025-10-21 from 15:00 to 15:30 (earliest common 30‑minute slot found that does not interrupt Bob’s morning). Plan cost = 2.
