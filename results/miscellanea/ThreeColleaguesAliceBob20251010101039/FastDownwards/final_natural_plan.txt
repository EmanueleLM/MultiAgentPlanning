1) advance t0 -> t12  
   - Move the current time pointer from t0 (09:00 on 2025-10-21) to t12 (15:00 on 2025-10-21).  
   - Effect: current time is now 15:00. (Advance spans 6 hours forward in the schedule.)

2) schedule-no-interrupt t12  
   - Schedule the 30-minute meeting at t12, i.e., starting 15:00 and ending 15:30 on 2025-10-21.  
   - Preconditions satisfied: Alice, Bob, and Carol are all free at 15:00; the slot is not in Bob’s "morning" window, so no interruption acknowledgement is needed.  
   - Effect: meeting is scheduled at 15:00–15:30.

Result: The meeting is scheduled on 2025-10-21 from 15:00 to 15:30 (earliest common 30‑minute slot found that does not interrupt Bob’s morning). Plan cost = 2.
