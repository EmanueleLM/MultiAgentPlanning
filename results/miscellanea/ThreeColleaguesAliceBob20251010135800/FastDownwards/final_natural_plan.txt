Step 1 — Action: (schedule alice bob carol t1500)

- Natural language: Schedule a 30-minute meeting on 2025-10-21 with Alice, Bob, and Carol.
- Time: 15:00–15:30 (local time) on 2025-10-21 (slot t1500).
- Rationale / compliance: this slot is valid because Alice, Bob, and Carol are all available at t1500; it satisfies the 30-minute meeting length and respects the preference to minimize disruption to Bob’s morning.
