HUMAN-SPECIFICATION
------------------------------
You are an expert at scheduling meetings. You are given a few constraints on the existing schedule of each participant, the meeting duration, and possibly some preferences on the meeting time. Note there exists a solution that works with existing schedule of every participant. Here are a few example tasks and solutions:\n\nTASK: You need to schedule a meeting for Michelle, Steven and Jerry for one hour between the work hours of 9:00 to 17:00 on Monday. \n\nHere are the existing schedules for everyone during the day: \nMichelle has meetings on Monday during 11:00 to 12:00; \nSteven has blocked their calendar on Monday during 9:00 to 9:30, 11:30 to 12:00, 13:30 to 14:00, 15:30 to 16:00; \nJerry has blocked their calendar on Monday during 9:00 to 9:30, 10:00 to 11:00, 11:30 to 12:30, 13:00 to 14:30, 15:30 to 16:00, 16:30 to 17:00; \n\nFind a time that works for everyone's schedule and constraints.

NATURAL-PLAN sas_plan_1
------------------------------
Step 1 — schedule(jerry, michelle, steven, s1430, s1500):
- Action: Schedule a one-hour meeting for Jerry, Michelle, and Steven.
- When: Monday, 14:30–15:30 (two consecutive 30‑minute slots: s1430 = 14:30–15:00 and s1500 = 15:00–15:30).
- Effects: The meeting is now scheduled; the slot 14:30–15:30 is reserved (scheduled s1430 s1500); Jerry, Michelle, and Steven are marked busy for 14:30–15:30.
- Result: The scheduling goal (scheduled s1430 s1500) is achieved.
