HUMAN-SPECIFICATION
------------------------------
You are an expert at scheduling meetings. You are given a few constraints on the existing schedule of each participant, the meeting duration, and possibly some preferences on the meeting time. Note there exists a solution that works with existing schedule of every participant. Here are a few example tasks and solutions:\n\nTASK: You need to schedule a meeting for Michelle, Steven and Jerry for one hour between the work hours of 9:00 to 17:00 on Monday. \n\nHere are the existing schedules for everyone during the day: \nMichelle has meetings on Monday during 11:00 to 12:00; \nSteven has blocked their calendar on Monday during 9:00 to 9:30, 11:30 to 12:00, 13:30 to 14:00, 15:30 to 16:00; \nJerry has blocked their calendar on Monday during 9:00 to 9:30, 10:00 to 11:00, 11:30 to 12:30, 13:00 to 14:30, 15:30 to 16:00, 16:30 to 17:00; \n\nFind a time that works for everyone's schedule and constraints.

Notes:
- The domain encodes three distinct agents (michelle, steven, jerry) via dedicated signing actions (sign-michelle-slot, sign-steven-slot, sign-jerry-slot) and separate schedule actions per time slot (schedule-0900, schedule-1000, ..., schedule-1600_1700). This preserves distinct agent actions while coordinating through per-slot sign-offs.
- Availability is expressed as hard constraints via the initial state. If a slot is not listed as available for a given agent, that agent cannot sign for that slot.
- The goal uses a disjunctive (or) goal to express “there exists a slot for which the meeting is scheduled.”
- The data provided by the three agents implies no slot is simultaneously available for all three participants (Jerry has blocks that cover all 60-minute windows), making the problem unsatisfiable. The FastDownward solver should report UNSAT for this combined domain/problem, properly flagging the over-subscription of slots given the hard constraints. If any single slot were feasible for all three, the earliest such slot would be chosen by the planner due to the per-slot costs (earlier slots have lower costs in the schedule actions).
