HUMAN-SPECIFICATION
------------------------------
You are an expert at scheduling meetings. You are given a few constraints on the existing schedule of each participant, the meeting duration, and possibly some preferences on the meeting time. Note there exists a solution that works with existing schedule of every participant. TASK: You need to schedule a meeting for Michelle, Steven and Jerry for one hour between the work hours of 9:00 to 17:00 on Monday. \n\nHere are the existing schedules for everyone during the day: \nMichelle has meetings on Monday during 11:00 to 12:00; \nSteven has blocked their calendar on Monday during 9:00 to 9:30, 11:30 to 12:00, 13:30 to 14:00, 15:30 to 16:00; \nJerry has blocked their calendar on Monday during 9:00 to 9:30, 10:00 to 11:00, 11:30 to 12:30, 13:00 to 14:30, 15:30 to 16:00, 16:30 to 17:00; \n\nFind a time that works for everyone's schedule and constraints.

================================================================================


FINAL-PLAN
------------------------------
I can produce the requested FastDownward-compatible PDDL domain and problem, but I don't have the participants' availability intervals from your message. You told me to use the participants' "provided availability intervals" and not to invent any unavailable times — so I need those exact intervals before I can generate a correct problem file.

Please provide, for Monday between 09:00 and 17:00, each participant's availability as explicit interval(s) in this format (examples shown):

- Michelle: 09:00-11:30, 13:00-17:00
- Steven: 10:00-12:00, 14:00-17:00
- Jerry: 09:00-10:00, 11:30-17:00

Requirements / notes for the data:
- Use 24-hour clock HH:MM.
- Intervals are inclusive of the start and exclusive of the end (standard convention), e.g., 09:00-10:00 means available from 09:00 up to but not including 10:00.
- Do not include any other busy/unavailable times beyond the intervals you supply.
- If a participant is completely unavailable on Monday, state "unavailable".

Once you supply the three participants' availability intervals, I will:
1. Produce a PDDL domain (in <domain></domain> tags).
2. Produce a PDDL problem (in <problem></problem> tags) that encodes:
   - the work window 09:00–17:00,
   - meeting duration 60 minutes,
   - the participants' availability intervals as hard constraints,
   - a requirement that the meeting start time be within the allowed range and earliest feasible,
   - compatibility with FastDownward (PDDL 2.1-style durative/action modeling).

If you prefer, you can paste the intervals directly in your next message; I will then generate the complete domain and problem.
