PROBLEM
------------------------------
I am playing with a set of objects. Here are the actions I can do

Paltry object_0 object_1 object_2.
Sip object_0 object_1 object_2.
Clip object_0 object_1 object_2.
Wretched object_0 object_1 object_2 object_3.
Memory object_0 object_1 object_2.
Tightfisted object_0 object_1 object_2.

I have the following restrictions on my actions:
To perform paltry action, the following facts need to be true: hand object_0, cats object_1, texture object_2, vase object_0 object_1, and next object_1 object_2
Once paltry is performed the following facts will be true: next object_0 object_2
Once paltry is performed the following facts will be false: vase object_0 object_1
To perform sip action, the following facts need to be true: hand object_0, cats object_1, texture object_2, next object_0 object_2, and next object_1 object_2
Once sip is performed the following facts will be true: vase object_0 object_1
Once sip is performed the following facts will be false: next object_0 object_2

Once clip is performed the following facts will be true: vase object_0 object_1
Once clip is performed the following facts will be false: next object_0 object_2
To perform wretched action, the following facts need to be true: sneeze object_0, texture object_1, texture object_2, stupendous object_3, next object_0 object_1, collect object_1 object_3, and collect object_2 object_3
Once wretched is performed the following facts will be true: next object_0 object_2
Once wretched is performed the following facts will be false: next object_0 object_1
To perform memory action, the following facts need to be true: cats object_0, spring object_1, spring object_2, and next object_0 object_1
Once memory is performed the following facts will be true: next object_0 object_2
Once memory is performed the following facts will be false: next object_0 object_1
To perform tightfisted action, the following facts need to be true: hand object_0, sneeze object_1, texture object_2, next object_1 object_2, and vase object_0 object_1
Once tightfisted is performed the following facts will be true: next object_0 object_2
Once tightfisted is performed the following facts will be false: vase object_0 object_1

FINAL-PLAN
------------------------------
I don’t yet have the two partial models from planner_A and planner_B. I can’t produce a correct combined PDDL domain+problem without them because your instructions forbid inventing availability or preferences beyond what those partial models contain.

Please either
- paste the two partial model descriptions (the planner_A and planner_B summaries), or
- confirm you want me to proceed with some explicit assumptions (I will list them below and will treat any natural-language preferences as hard constraints).

If you want me to proceed without additional input, tell me which of the following assumptions I should apply (or provide alternatives). If you choose to provide the partial models, include for each:
- agent name (e.g., agent_a, agent_b)
- objects (locations, resources, tools, time slots) and their names
- predicates each agent uses and any synonyms
- action descriptions: name, parameters, preconditions, effects, duration or time windows if any
- initial state facts and any unavailable timeslots or reserved resources
- explicit goals (per-agent or global)
- any strict constraints that must be enforced (e.g., "slot 3 is blocked", "agent A must not use resource X", "earliest time = 8")

If you prefer I proceed using assumptions, I will assume:
- Two agents named planner_A and planner_B.
- A small set of shared locations and resources explicitly listed by you (or I will create canonical names but only if you permit).
- Time represented as discrete integer time steps using a numeric fluent (current-time) and actions that advance time; time windows from natural-language preferences will be converted to hard constraints.
- Maintain distinct action names even for conceptually identical actions from different agents (e.g., move_A vs move_B).
- Use only :strips :typing :fluents (if numeric time is used) :negative-preconditions as needed — I’ll confirm the exact :requirements once I have the models.

Which do you prefer? Paste the two partial models now, or confirm you want me to proceed under the listed assumptions (and, if proceeding, specify domain/problem names and whether temporal numeric modeling is acceptable)?

NATURAL-PLAN sas_plan_1
------------------------------
Summary: follow the given two-step plan exactly. All preconditions for each step are satisfied in the provided initial state; no unmet preconditions or contradictions. Total plan cost = 2 unit steps.

Step 1 — sip object_8 object_0 object_7
- Action instance: sip(?o0=object_8, ?o1=object_0, ?o2=object_7)
- Timestamp: start t=0.0, duration 1.0, end t=1.0
- Required preconditions (checked at t=0):
  - (hand object_8) — present in init
  - (cats object_0) — present in init
  - (texture object_7) — present in init
  - (next object_8 object_7) — present in init
  - (next object_0 object_7) — present in init
  => All preconditions satisfied.
- Effects (applied at t=1.0):
  - Add: (vase object_8 object_0)
  - Delete: (next object_8 object_7)
- Resulting immediate state changes after Step 1:
  - (vase object_8 object_0) is now true.
  - (next object_8 object_7) is now false (removed).
  - All other initial facts remain unchanged.

Step 2 — paltry object_8 object_0 object_6
- Action instance: paltry(?o0=object_8, ?o1=object_0, ?o2=object_6)
- Timestamp: start t=1.0, duration 1.0, end t=2.0
- Required preconditions (checked at t=1.0, after Step 1 effects):
  - (hand object_8) — present in init and unchanged
  - (cats object_0) — present in init and unchanged
  - (texture object_6) — present in init
  - (vase object_8 object_0) — added by Step 1 (present at t=1.0)
  - (next object_0 object_6) — present in init
  => All preconditions satisfied.
- Effects (applied at t=2.0):
  - Add: (next object_8 object_6)
  - Delete: (vase object_8 object_0)
- Resulting immediate state changes after Step 2:
  - (next object_8 object_6) is now true.
  - (vase object_8 object_0) is now false (removed).
  - (next object_7 object_6) remained true from the initial state.

Final state check (at t=2.0)
- Goal was: (next object_7 object_6) and (next object_8 object_6)
  - (next object_7 object_6) — true in initial state and unchanged
  - (next object_8 object_6) — achieved by Step 2
=> Both goal predicates are satisfied.

Warnings / Notes
- No action application failed; all preconditions were met when each action was executed.
- The plan follows exactly the provided action sequence and achieves the goal in 2 steps (total duration 2.0 time units).
