Summary: follow the given two-step plan exactly. All preconditions for each step are satisfied in the provided initial state; no unmet preconditions or contradictions. Total plan cost = 2 unit steps.

Step 1 — sip object_8 object_0 object_7
- Action instance: sip(?o0=object_8, ?o1=object_0, ?o2=object_7)
- Timestamp: start t=0.0, duration 1.0, end t=1.0
- Required preconditions (checked at t=0):
  - (hand object_8) — present in init
  - (cats object_0) — present in init
  - (texture object_7) — present in init
  - (next object_8 object_7) — present in init
  - (next object_0 object_7) — present in init
  => All preconditions satisfied.
- Effects (applied at t=1.0):
  - Add: (vase object_8 object_0)
  - Delete: (next object_8 object_7)
- Resulting immediate state changes after Step 1:
  - (vase object_8 object_0) is now true.
  - (next object_8 object_7) is now false (removed).
  - All other initial facts remain unchanged.

Step 2 — paltry object_8 object_0 object_6
- Action instance: paltry(?o0=object_8, ?o1=object_0, ?o2=object_6)
- Timestamp: start t=1.0, duration 1.0, end t=2.0
- Required preconditions (checked at t=1.0, after Step 1 effects):
  - (hand object_8) — present in init and unchanged
  - (cats object_0) — present in init and unchanged
  - (texture object_6) — present in init
  - (vase object_8 object_0) — added by Step 1 (present at t=1.0)
  - (next object_0 object_6) — present in init
  => All preconditions satisfied.
- Effects (applied at t=2.0):
  - Add: (next object_8 object_6)
  - Delete: (vase object_8 object_0)
- Resulting immediate state changes after Step 2:
  - (next object_8 object_6) is now true.
  - (vase object_8 object_0) is now false (removed).
  - (next object_7 object_6) remained true from the initial state.

Final state check (at t=2.0)
- Goal was: (next object_7 object_6) and (next object_8 object_6)
  - (next object_7 object_6) — true in initial state and unchanged
  - (next object_8 object_6) — achieved by Step 2
=> Both goal predicates are satisfied.

Warnings / Notes
- No action application failed; all preconditions were met when each action was executed.
- The plan follows exactly the provided action sequence and achieves the goal in 2 steps (total duration 2.0 time units).
