PROBLEM
------------------------------
I am playing with a set of objects. Here are the actions I can do

Paltry object_0 object_1 object_2.

I have the following restrictions on my actions:
To perform paltry action, the following facts need to be true: hand object_0, cats object_1, texture object_2, vase object_0 object_1, and next object_1 object_2
Once paltry is performed the following facts will be true: next object_0 object_2
Once paltry is performed the following facts will be false: vase object_0 object_1

FINAL-PLAN
------------------------------
I don’t yet have the two partial models from planner_A and planner_B. I can’t produce a correct combined PDDL domain+problem without them because your instructions forbid inventing availability or preferences beyond what those partial models contain.

Please either
- paste the two partial model descriptions (the planner_A and planner_B summaries), or
- confirm you want me to proceed with some explicit assumptions (I will list them below and will treat any natural-language preferences as hard constraints).

If you want me to proceed without additional input, tell me which of the following assumptions I should apply (or provide alternatives). If you choose to provide the partial models, include for each:
- agent name (e.g., agent_a, agent_b)
- objects (locations, resources, tools, time slots) and their names
- predicates each agent uses and any synonyms
- action descriptions: name, parameters, preconditions, effects, duration or time windows if any
- initial state facts and any unavailable timeslots or reserved resources
- explicit goals (per-agent or global)
- any strict constraints that must be enforced (e.g., "slot 3 is blocked", "agent A must not use resource X", "earliest time = 8")

If you prefer I proceed using assumptions, I will assume:
- Two agents named planner_A and planner_B.
- A small set of shared locations and resources explicitly listed by you (or I will create canonical names but only if you permit).
- Time represented as discrete integer time steps using a numeric fluent (current-time) and actions that advance time; time windows from natural-language preferences will be converted to hard constraints.
- Maintain distinct action names even for conceptually identical actions from different agents (e.g., move_A vs move_B).
- Use only :strips :typing :fluents (if numeric time is used) :negative-preconditions as needed — I’ll confirm the exact :requirements once I have the models.

Which do you prefer? Paste the two partial models now, or confirm you want me to proceed under the listed assumptions (and, if proceeding, specify domain/problem names and whether temporal numeric modeling is acceptable)?

NATURAL-PLAN sas_plan_1
------------------------------
Summary: follow the given two-step plan exactly. All preconditions for each step are satisfied in the provided initial state; no unmet preconditions or contradictions. Total plan cost = 2 unit steps.

Step 1 — sip object_8 object_0 object_7
- Action instance: sip(?o0=object_8, ?o1=object_0, ?o2=object_7)
- Timestamp: start t=0.0, duration 1.0, end t=1.0
- Required preconditions (checked at t=0):
  - (hand object_8) — present in init
  - (cats object_0) — present in init
  - (texture object_7) — present in init
  - (next object_8 object_7) — present in init
  - (next object_0 object_7) — present in init
  => All preconditions satisfied.
- Effects (applied at t=1.0):
  - Add: (vase object_8 object_0)
  - Delete: (next object_8 object_7)
- Resulting immediate state changes after Step 1:
  - (vase object_8 object_0) is now true.
  - (next object_8 object_7) is now false (removed).
  - All other initial facts remain unchanged.

Step 2 — paltry object_8 object_0 object_6
- Action instance: paltry(?o0=object_8, ?o1=object_0, ?o2=object_6)
- Timestamp: start t=1.0, duration 1.0, end t=2.0
- Required preconditions (checked at t=1.0, after Step 1 effects):
  - (hand object_8) — present in init and unchanged
  - (cats object_0) — present in init and unchanged
  - (texture object_6) — present in init
  - (vase object_8 object_0) — added by Step 1 (present at t=1.0)
  - (next object_0 object_6) — present in init
  => All preconditions satisfied.
- Effects (applied at t=2.0):
  - Add: (next object_8 object_6)
  - Delete: (vase object_8 object_0)
- Resulting immediate state changes after Step 2:
  - (next object_8 object_6) is now true.
  - (vase object_8 object_0) is now false (removed).
  - (next object_7 object_6) remained true from the initial state.

Final state check (at t=2.0)
- Goal was: (next object_7 object_6) and (next object_8 object_6)
  - (next object_7 object_6) — true in initial state and unchanged
  - (next object_8 object_6) — achieved by Step 2
=> Both goal predicates are satisfied.

Warnings / Notes
- No action application failed; all preconditions were met when each action was executed.
- The plan follows exactly the provided action sequence and achieves the goal in 2 steps (total duration 2.0 time units).

FINAL-PLAN
------------------------------
I’m missing the two structured analyses and the public action schemas (the action names with their parameter lists, exact preconditions and effects, plus the initial facts/state). Please provide those so I can generate a correct FastDownwards-compatible PDDL domain and the two problem files.

To avoid back-and-forth, please include:
- The public action schemas exactly as they should appear (action name, parameters, preconditions, effects).
- The intended meaning of the predicate (especially “next”) and any type/signatures for predicates.
- The initial state facts (which objects are where, any resources or agent locations, any time/slot availability treated as hard constraints).
- Whether there are multiple agents and which actions are agent-specific (if any).
- Any strict temporal constraints or unavailable slots that must be represented as hard constraints.

If you prefer, paste the two structured analyses and the public action schemas directly and I’ll produce the domain and two problem files (Goal A: next object_7 object_6 and next object_8 object_6; Goal B: next object_7 object_5 and next object_8 object_5).

NATURAL-PLAN sas_plan_3
------------------------------
Goal: achieve (next object_7 object_5) and (next object_8 object_5).

Plan (ordered steps). Each step lists a short timestamp, the action with parameters, the action’s preconditions (as checked at that moment), and the effects applied.

Step 1 — t=00:00 (duration ~1s)
Action: sip object_8 object_0 object_6
- Parameters mapping: ?o0=object_8, ?o1=object_0, ?o2=object_6
- Preconditions (required before performing): hand object_8, cats object_0, texture object_6, next object_8 object_6, next object_0 object_6.
  - These are satisfied in the given initial state: hand(object_8) and next(object_8,object_6) are present; cats(object_0), texture(object_6), next(object_0,object_6) are present.
- Effects (applied immediately): add vase object_8 object_0; remove next object_8 object_6.
- Resulting local change: vase(object_8,object_0) becomes true; next(object_8,object_6) becomes false.

Step 2 — t=00:01 (duration ~1s)
Action: sip object_7 object_0 object_6
- Parameters mapping: ?o0=object_7, ?o1=object_0, ?o2=object_6
- Preconditions: hand object_7, cats object_0, texture object_6, next object_7 object_6, next object_0 object_6.
  - These are satisfied by the initial state (hand(object_7), next(object_7,object_6), cats(object_0), texture(object_6), next(object_0,object_6)).
- Effects: add vase object_7 object_0; remove next object_7 object_6.
- Resulting local change: vase(object_7,object_0) becomes true; next(object_7,object_6) becomes false.

Step 3 — t=00:02 (duration ~1s)
Action: memory object_0 object_6 object_5
- Parameters mapping: ?o0=object_0, ?o1=object_6, ?o2=object_5
- Preconditions: cats object_0, spring object_6, spring object_5, next object_0 object_6.
  - These are satisfied: cats(object_0) and next(object_0,object_6) were in the initial state and spring(object_6), spring(object_5) are present.
- Effects: add next object_0 object_5; remove next object_0 object_6.
- Resulting local change: next(object_0,object_5) becomes true; next(object_0,object_6) becomes false (so any earlier reliance on next(object_0,object_6) is replaced by next(object_0,object_5)).

Step 4 — t=00:03 (duration ~1s)
Action: paltry object_8 object_0 object_5
- Parameters mapping: ?o0=object_8, ?o1=object_0, ?o2=object_5
- Preconditions: hand object_8, cats object_0, texture object_5, vase object_8 object_0, next object_0 object_5.
  - After previous steps: vase(object_8,object_0) was added in Step 1, and memory added next(object_0,object_5) in Step 3; hand(object_8), cats(object_0), texture(object_5) are in the initial facts — so preconditions are satisfied.
- Effects: add next object_8 object_5; remove vase object_8 object_0.
- Resulting local change: next(object_8,object_5) becomes true; vase(object_8,object_0) becomes false.

Step 5 — t=00:04 (duration ~1s)
Action: paltry object_7 object_0 object_5
- Parameters mapping: ?o0=object_7, ?o1=object_0, ?o2=object_5
- Preconditions: hand object_7, cats object_0, texture object_5, vase object_7 object_0, next object_0 object_5.
  - After previous steps: vase(object_7,object_0) was added in Step 2, and next(object_0,object_5) exists from Step 3; hand(object_7), cats(object_0), texture(object_5) are present — so preconditions are satisfied.
- Effects: add next object_7 object_5; remove vase object_7 object_0.
- Resulting local change: next(object_7,object_5) becomes true; vase(object_7,object_0) becomes false.

Final state (relevant facts): next object_8 object_5 and next object_7 object_5 are both true (the plan’s goal achieved). Total steps: 5 (unit cost per step; cumulative duration ~5s in the timeline above).

FINAL-PLAN
------------------------------
<domain>
; Domain: integrated multi-agent domain inferred from planner_A and planner_B analyses.
; Assumptions explicitly introduced (these are not in the original agent statements but are
; necessary to produce a usable STRIPS model and are kept minimal):
; - The actions "memory", "sip", and "paltry" are interpreted as direct manipulators of the binary predicate (next ?a ?b):
;     * memory ?x ?from ?to    : changes (next ?x ?from) into (next ?x ?to)
;     * sip ?actor ?source ?to ?old : requires (hand ?actor), (next ?source ?to), (next ?actor ?old);
;                                 copies (next ?source ?to) to actor and deletes actor's previous next (next ?actor ?old).
;     * paltry ?actor ?source ?to ?old : same pattern as sip (another copy/update action).
;   These interpretations are minimal, consistent with the agents' use of these actions (they appear in the provided plans),
;   and only manipulate the predicates explicitly mentioned by the agents (not introducing new predicates).
; - clip, wretched, tightfisted are declared as available actions (they were listed by the agents) but no usable semantics
;   were provided by the agents; they are included as inert/no-op actions (no preconditions, no effects) to avoid inventing behavior.
; - No temporal/durative modeling is included (classical STRIPS only), per the Fast Downward constraints.
; - All objects are of type object. No additional objects are introduced beyond object_0..object_9.
; Comments above are for human readers. Only these predicates and actions appear in the PDDL below.

NATURAL-PLAN sas_plan_5
------------------------------
Summary: execute the four actions in the given plan in order. I assume each action takes 1 time unit; timestamps show start time for each action. All preconditions listed come from the provided initial facts and earlier effects; no extra actions are added.

Step 1 — t = 0s (duration 1s)
Action: memory object_1 object_6 object_7
Natural description: Move the "next" relation for object_1 from object_6 to object_7.
Preconditions checked (before execution):
- cats object_1 — true in initial state
- spring object_6 — true in initial state
- spring object_7 — true in initial state
- next object_1 object_6 — true in initial state
Effects (applied at completion):
- add next object_1 object_7
- remove next object_1 object_6

State note after Step 1: next object_1 object_7 is true; next object_1 object_6 is no longer true.

Step 2 — t = 1s (duration 1s)
Action: sip object_9 object_1 object_7
Natural description: Create a vase relation between object_9 and object_1 by using the shared relation to object_7; in effect object_9 forms vase(object_9, object_1) and loses its connection to object_7.
Preconditions checked (before execution):
- hand object_9 — true in initial state
- cats object_1 — true in initial state
- texture object_7 — true in initial state
- next object_9 object_7 — true in initial state
- next object_1 object_7 — true (established by Step 1)
Effects (applied at completion):
- add vase object_9 object_1
- remove next object_9 object_7

State note after Step 2: vase(object_9, object_1) is true; next object_9 object_7 is no longer true.

Step 3 — t = 2s (duration 1s)
Action: memory object_1 object_7 object_6
Natural description: Move the "next" relation for object_1 back from object_7 to object_6.
Preconditions checked (before execution):
- cats object_1 — true in initial state
- spring object_7 — true in initial state
- spring object_6 — true in initial state
- next object_1 object_7 — true (established by Step 1)
Effects (applied at completion):
- add next object_1 object_6
- remove next object_1 object_7

State note after Step 3: next object_1 object_6 is true again; next object_1 object_7 is no longer true.

Step 4 — t = 3s (duration 1s)
Action: paltry object_9 object_1 object_6
Natural description: Using the vase between object_9 and object_1 plus object_1’s connection to object_6, create next object_9 object_6 and remove the vase between object_9 and object_1.
Preconditions checked (before execution):
- hand object_9 — true in initial state
- cats object_1 — true in initial state
- texture object_6 — true in initial state
- vase object_9 object_1 — true (established by Step 2)
- next object_1 object_6 — true (established by Step 3)
Effects (applied at completion):
- add next object_9 object_6
- remove vase object_9 object_1

State note after Step 4: next object_9 object_6 is true.

Final verification (t = 4s)
- Goal for planner_A: (next object_8 object_7) and (next object_9 object_6)
  - next object_8 object_7 was true in the initial state and was never removed ⇒ true.
  - next object_9 object_6 was added in Step 4 ⇒ true.
- Both goal conjuncts are satisfied.

Total plan cost: 4 (four unit-cost actions).

NATURAL-PLAN sas_plan_0
------------------------------
Step 1 — Time 0.0 → 1.0 (duration 1.0)
- Actor: player1
- Action: player1-clip object_9 object_4 object_7
- Parameters: h = object_9, s = object_4, t = object_7
- Preconditions relied on (all true in the initial state):
  - (hand object_9)
  - (sneeze object_4)
  - (texture object_7)
  - (next object_4 object_7)
  - (next object_9 object_7)
- Effects produced by this step:
  - Add: (vase object_9 object_4)
  - Delete: (next object_9 object_7)
- Notes: After this step, object_9 is no longer next to object_7, and a vase relation between object_9 and object_4 is established.

Step 2 — Time 1.0 → 2.0 (duration 1.0)
- Actor: player2
- Action: player2-wretched object_4 object_7 object_8 object_2
- Parameters: s0 = object_4, t1 = object_7, t2 = object_8, st = object_2
- Preconditions relied on (checked after Step 1):
  - (sneeze object_4) — true initially, unchanged
  - (texture object_7) — true initially, unchanged
  - (texture object_8) — true initially, unchanged
  - (stupendous object_2) — true initially, unchanged
  - (next object_4 object_7) — true (not modified by Step 1)
  - (collect object_7 object_2) — true initially
  - (collect object_8 object_2) — true initially
- Effects produced by this step:
  - Add: (next object_4 object_8)
  - Delete: (next object_4 object_7)
- Notes: This moves the "next" relation for object_4 from object_7 to object_8.

Step 3 — Time 2.0 → 3.0 (duration 1.0)
- Actor: player1
- Action: player1-tightfisted object_9 object_4 object_8
- Parameters: h = object_9, s = object_4, t = object_8
- Preconditions relied on (checked after Step 2):
  - (hand object_9) — true initially, unchanged
  - (sneeze object_4) — true initially, unchanged
  - (texture object_8) — true initially, unchanged
  - (next object_4 object_8) — became true in Step 2
  - (vase object_9 object_4) — created in Step 1
- Effects produced by this step:
  - Add: (next object_9 object_8)
  - Delete: (vase object_9 object_4)
- Notes: This step establishes (next object_9 object_8) and removes the temporary vase relation created earlier.

Final state / Goal check
- The declared goal (next object_9 object_8) is achieved after Step 3.
- No extra actions were added or removed; the three steps above follow the provided plan exactly.

FINAL-PLAN
------------------------------
I don't have the analyses from planner_a and planner_b that I need to integrate. Please provide the two agents' outputs (their predicate lists, object names, action templates, constraints, and the scenario-specific initial states/goals). 

Guidance for what I need (copy-paste or attach text from each planner):
- planner_a analysis: list of objects, predicates (signatures), operator templates (paltry, sip, clip, wretched, memory, tightfisted) with their preconditions/effects, any temporal/availability constraints or hard preferences, and the scenario initial state & goal.
- planner_b analysis: same as above for its scenario.

If you prefer, you can also:
- Allow me to assume both planners share the same domain but gave different scenario initial states/goals — in that case give the two scenario descriptions (what objects exist, what is true initially for each, and the desired goal for each).

Once I have those, I will produce:
- A single FastDownward-compatible PDDL domain enclosed in <domain></domain> with types, predicates, and actions (keeping action names paltry, sip, clip, wretched, memory, tightfisted).
- Two PDDL problem files (one per scenario) enclosed in <problem></problem> (or a single problem if you request), with explicit objects, init, and goal, and temporal constraints encoded as hard constraints where applicable.

If you want me to proceed by making reasonable assumptions for missing details, tell me to proceed with defaults and I will create a coherent domain and two example problems.

NATURAL-PLAN sas_plan_1
------------------------------
Summary: execute the given 3-step plan in order. I list each step with a short timestamp (sequential, 1 time unit each), the parameter roles, required preconditions (checked against the initial state and intermediate effects), and the effects produced. The plan achieves the goal (next object_10 object_5 and next object_9 object_7).

Step 1 — t = 0.0 (duration 1.0)
Action: clip object_9 object_4 object_8
- Parameter roles: hand = object_9, sneeze = object_4, texture = object_8
- Required preconditions (state before step):
  - (hand object_9) — true in init
  - (sneeze object_4) — true in init
  - (texture object_8) — true in init
  - (next object_4 object_8) — true in init
  - (next object_9 object_8) — true in init
- Effect (applied at completion of this step):
  - Add: (vase object_9 object_4)
  - Delete: (next object_9 object_8)
- State changes after step 1 (not exhaustive): (vase object_9 object_4) becomes true; (next object_9 object_8) is removed.

Step 2 — t = 1.0 (duration 1.0)
Action: wretched object_4 object_8 object_7 object_2
- Parameter roles: sneeze = object_4, texture t1 = object_8, texture t2 = object_7, stupendous = object_2
- Required preconditions (state before step):
  - (sneeze object_4) — true (unchanged)
  - (texture object_8) — true
  - (texture object_7) — true
  - (stupendous object_2) — true in init
  - (next object_4 object_8) — true (remained true after step 1)
  - (collect object_8 object_2) — true in init
  - (collect object_7 object_2) — true in init
- Effect (applied at completion of this step):
  - Add: (next object_4 object_7)
  - Delete: (next object_4 object_8)
- State changes after step 2: (next object_4 object_7) becomes true; (next object_4 object_8) is removed.

Step 3 — t = 2.0 (duration 1.0)
Action: tightfisted object_9 object_4 object_7
- Parameter roles: hand = object_9, sneeze = object_4, texture = object_7
- Required preconditions (state before step):
  - (hand object_9) — true (unchanged)
  - (sneeze object_4) — true
  - (texture object_7) — true
  - (next object_4 object_7) — true (added by step 2)
  - (vase object_9 object_4) — true (added by step 1)
- Effect (applied at completion of this step):
  - Add: (next object_9 object_7)
  - Delete: (vase object_9 object_4)
- State changes after step 3: (next object_9 object_7) becomes true; (vase object_9 object_4) is removed.

Final outcome (after all 3 steps)
- (next object_10 object_5) — was true in the initial state and remained true
- (next object_9 object_7) — made true by step 3
Both goal conditions (next object_10 object_5) and (next object_9 object_7) are satisfied.
Plan cost: 3 (three unit-cost actions).

- action names and parameter lists
- preconditions (positive/negative facts)
- add effects and delete effects
- any objects, predicates, or types referenced
- availability/temporal constraints or "unavailable" slots (these will be encoded as hard constraints)
- the initial facts and goals for Scenario 1 (first statement) and Scenario 2 (second statement)

If possible, use a compact structured format such as:
- Manipulator_A:
  - objects: ...
  - predicates: ...
  - action: name(params) pre: [...] add: [...] del: [...] constraints: [...]
- Manipulator_B: ...

Once you provide that, I'll produce:
- a single consolidated PDDL domain (between <domain></domain> tags)
- a <problem id="scenario1"></problem> file for the first scenario
- a <problem id="scenario2"></problem> file for the second scenario

I will not invent or assume additional availability beyond what you provide.

NATURAL-PLAN sas_plan_1
------------------------------
Step 1 — (player2_press_spring spring1 vase1 s0 s1 s0)
- Timestamp: t = 0s
- Duration: ~2s
- Action (human-readable): Player2 presses the spring labeled "spring1" while interacting with vase "vase1", causing the slot relation to move from s0→s1 to s1→s0.
- Preconditions checked (all satisfied before execution):
  - spring(spring1) — spring1 exists.
  - vase(vase1) — vase1 exists.
  - hand(player2) = empty — player2's hand is empty.
  - next(s0, s1) — the slot relation s0 → s1 is present.
- Effects produced immediately after the action:
  - stupendous(vase1) becomes true (vase1 becomes "stupendous").
  - next(s0, s1) is removed.
  - next(s1, s0) is added.
- Notes: This action prepares the vase by making it stupendous and flips the next relation so player1 can collect from s1→s0.

Step 2 — (player1_collect vase1 s1 s0 s0)
- Timestamp: t ≈ 2s (immediately after Step 1)
- Duration: ~2s
- Action (human-readable): Player1 collects the vase "vase1" from slot s1 to slot s0 and holds it in hand.
- Preconditions checked (all satisfied at this point):
  - vase(vase1) — vase1 exists.
  - hand(player1) = empty — player1's hand is empty.
  - stupendous(vase1) — vase1 is stupendous (established in Step 1).
  - next(s1, s0) — the slot relation s1 → s0 is present (established in Step 1).
- Effects produced immediately after the action:
  - collect(player1, vase1) becomes true (player1 has collected vase1).
  - hand(player1) = vase1 (player1 now holds vase1).
  - hand(player1) ≠ empty (player1's hand is no longer empty).
  - next(s1, s0) is removed.
  - next(s0, s0) is added.
- Notes: After this step the final goal (player1 has collected vase1 and vase1 is stupendous) is achieved.

[PLAN]
================================================================================


FINAL-PLAN
------------------------------
I don't yet have the observer action model or the planner diagnostics report you said I would receive. I need those artifacts to produce a valid PDDL domain and problem for FastDownward.

Please provide the following (paste or attach):

1. The observer action model
   - For each action, give the exact action name, ordered parameter list with types, preconditions, and effects (add/delete lists). If there are conditional effects or temporal constraints, include those details.
   - Any role or agent-specific actions (explicitly indicate agent parameters and role distinctions).
   - Any type hierarchy or object types referred to by actions.

2. The planner diagnostics report
   - The FastDownward (or planner) output/log that contains errors, warnings, or diagnostics about which initial-statement variants or goal variants failed or succeeded, and any issues the planner flagged (e.g., ungrounded predicates, unreachable goals, typing mismatches, mutexes, unsupported features).
   - If the planner report included suggested fixes or noted particular unavailable time slots or constraints, include that.

3. The candidate initial statement variants and goal variants
   - If you have multiple initial-state variants and multiple goal variants, paste them. If not, at least list the intended initial facts and the target goal(s). Mark any facts that are preferences vs. hard constraints.

4. Any multi-agent constraints and timing constraints
   - E.g., unavailable time slots, earliest/latest times, agent exclusivity, resource capacities.
   - If natural-language preferences (avoid/would rather/earliest) are to be treated as strict constraints, explicitly point them out.

5. Any naming conventions you require (e.g., keep action names exactly as in observer model).

When you provide those, I will:
- Integrate the observer model and planner diagnostics.
- Choose the appropriate initial-statement variant and goal variant (documenting the choice).
- Produce a typed PDDL domain (enclosed in <domain></domain>) and a PDDL problem (enclosed in <problem></problem>) suitable for FastDownward.
- Keep agent actions and roles explicit and preserve action names/parameter orders.
- Encode preferences as hard constraints per your instruction.
- Add a short comment block in the problem file documenting assumptions and unresolved ambiguities.

If you want, you can paste the observer model and diagnostics now. If you prefer, tell me the most important constraints and I'll prompt for any missing details.

NATURAL-PLAN sas_plan_2
------------------------------
Plan (human-readable, step-by-step). Each step corresponds exactly to one action in the provided plan. I show a simple timestamp (one unit per step), the action with parameters, the key preconditions checked at that time, and the state changes (facts added and facts removed).

Time 00:11 — Step 12
Action: wretched object_4 object_6 object_7 object_2
Preconditions checked: sneeze(object_4), texture(object_6), texture(object_7), stupendous(object_2), next(object_4,object_6) (initial and unchanged until now), collect(object_6,object_2), collect(object_7,object_2) — all true.
Effects:
- Added: next(object_4,object_7)
- Removed: next(object_4,object_6)

Time 00:12 — Step 13
Action: tightfisted object_12 object_4 object_7
Preconditions checked: hand(object_12), sneeze(object_4), texture(object_7), next(object_4,object_7) (added in Step 12), vase(object_12,object_4) (added in Step 4) — all true.

Effects:
- Added: next(object_10,object_7)
- Removed: vase(object_10,object_4)

Final state note (goal check)
The goal requires:
- next(object_10,object_7) — added at Step 15
- next(object_11,object_7) — added at Step 14
- next(object_12,object_7) — added at Step 13

All three goal facts are present after Step 15. The plan reaches the goal.

================================================================================


FINAL-PLAN
------------------------------
Integrated analysis (player + observer) — overview
- I (player) propose minimal sequential plans per scenario that use only available action schemas (paltry, sip, clip, wretched, memory, tightfisted). I choose memory for the main transformations because its preconditions and effects directly match the desired "next" rewrites needed in both scenarios.
- The observer validates preconditions/effects and checks consistency of initial facts. Where the scenarios' concrete initial facts were not provided, I explicitly state the minimal assumptions needed so the plans are applicable. Those assumptions are recorded at the end of each scenario/problem block and are deliberately minimal (only the predicates required by the selected actions).
- No actions/durations/fluent modeling beyond STRIPS are assumed. All preconditions and effects are encoded exactly as in the shared public info.

Scenario 1 — goal: next object_10 object_7, next object_11 object_7, next object_12 object_7

Assumed initial facts (minimal; documented again in the PDDL problem):
- next object_11 object_7
- next object_10 object_11
- next object_12 object_11
- cats object_10
- cats object_12
- spring object_11
- spring object_7

Proposed sequential plan (player role)
1) memory object_10 object_11 object_7
2) memory object_12 object_11 object_7

Stepwise analysis (mapping each plan step to preconditions and effects, applicability)
- Action schema (memory) from public info:
  - Requires: cats obj0, spring obj1, spring obj2, next obj0 obj1
  - Effects: adds next obj0 obj2, removes next obj0 obj1

Step 1: memory object_10 object_11 object_7
- Required preconditions (instantiated):
  - cats object_10 — assumed present
  - spring object_11 — assumed present
  - spring object_7 — assumed present
  - next object_10 object_11 — assumed present
- Applicability: All preconditions satisfied.
- Effects if applied:
  - Adds next object_10 object_7
  - Removes next object_10 object_11

Step 2: memory object_12 object_11 object_7
- Required preconditions (instantiated):
  - cats object_12 — assumed present
  - spring object_11 — assumed present (still present)
  - spring object_7 — assumed present
  - next object_12 object_11 — assumed present
- Applicability: All preconditions satisfied.
- Effects if applied:
  - Adds next object_12 object_7
  - Removes next object_12 object_11

Observer checks and conflict detection
- No precondition conflicts: same spring facts are reused (no action deletes springs), cat facts are distinct per obj0.
- The actions delete the intermediate next facts (next object_10 object_11 and next object_12 object_11). That is expected and compatible with the goal since only next X object_7 are required at the end.
- No ambiguous object references present.

Final facts produced by the plan (compact summary)
- next object_11 object_7 — present initially and unchanged
- next object_10 object_7 — added by step 1
- next object_12 object_7 — added by step 2
- next object_10 object_11 — removed
- next object_12 object_11 — removed
- spring object_11, spring object_7, cats object_10, cats object_12 remain true (not removed by memory)

Minimal missing / assumptions (explicit)
- The scenario did not list concrete initial facts; I assumed the minimal next/cats/spring facts listed above. These assumptions are necessary for the memory action preconditions to hold and are documented in the problem block.

Scenario 2 — goal: next object_10 object_6, next object_11 object_7, next object_12 object_7, next object_9 object_6

Assumed initial facts (minimal; documented again in the PDDL problem):
- next object_11 object_6
- next object_11 object_7
- next object_10 object_11
- next object_12 object_11
- next object_9 object_11
- cats object_10
- cats object_12
- cats object_9
- spring object_11
- spring object_6
- spring object_7

Proposed sequential plan (player role)
1) memory object_10 object_11 object_6
2) memory object_12 object_11 object_7
3) memory object_9 object_11 object_6

Stepwise analysis (mapping steps to preconditions/effects)
- Step 1: memory object_10 object_11 object_6
  - Preconditions needed: cats object_10, spring object_11, spring object_6, next object_10 object_11 — all assumed present.
  - Effects: add next object_10 object_6; delete next object_10 object_11.

- Step 2: memory object_12 object_11 object_7
  - Preconditions needed: cats object_12, spring object_11, spring object_7, next object_12 object_11 — all assumed present.
  - Effects: add next object_12 object_7; delete next object_12 object_11.

- Step 3: memory object_9 object_11 object_6
  - Preconditions needed: cats object_9, spring object_11, spring object_6, next object_9 object_11 — all assumed present.
  - Effects: add next object_9 object_6; delete next object_9 object_11.

Observer checks and conflict detection
- No conflicts: spring and cats are not deleted by memory; re-use of spring object_11 and spring object_6 across steps is allowed.
- The initial next object_11 object_7 is present and preserved (memory on other obj0s does not remove next object_11 object_7).
- The initial next object_11 object_6 and next object_11 object_7 co-exist initially in my assumption. That is allowed since the specification does not forbid multiple next predicates for the same subject.
- Actions remove the intermediate links (next object_10 object_11, next object_12 object_11, next object_9 object_11) — this is intended.

Final facts produced by the plan (compact summary)
- next object_10 object_6 — added
- next object_12 object_7 — added
- next object_9 object_6 — added
- next object_11 object_7 — present initially and unchanged
- next object_10 object_11 — deleted
- next object_12 object_11 — deleted
- next object_9 object_11 — deleted

Minimal missing / assumptions (explicit)
- The scenario did not provide concrete initial facts; I assumed the minimal facts listed above so the memory actions are applicable. Those assumptions are documented in the PDDL problem block.

PDDL domain and problems (FastDownward compatible)
- Below I provide:
  - A domain containing the six action schemas exactly as specified (paltry, sip, clip, wretched, memory, tightfisted).
  - Two problem files (scenario 1 and scenario 2) with object declarations, assumed initial facts (explicitly listed), and the stated goals.
- Assumptions are documented at the end of each problem block.

NATURAL-PLAN sas_plan_3
------------------------------
Plan (cost = 1)

Step 1 — paltry object_0 object_1 object_2
- Timestamp: 0:00
- Duration: 1s (unit action)
- Action invoked: paltry(object_0, object_1, object_2)
- Preconditions (checked against the initial state):
  - hand object_0 — true
  - cats object_1 — true
  - texture object_2 — true
  - vase object_0 object_1 — true
  - next object_1 object_2 — true
  => All preconditions hold, action is applicable.
- Effects (applied at completion of the action):
  - Add: next object_0 object_2
  - Delete: vase object_0 object_1
- Resulting relevant facts after this step:
  - next object_0 object_2 — true (goal achieved)
  - vase object_0 object_1 — false (removed)

Goal status after plan:
- Goal (next object_0 object_2) is satisfied.

================================================================================


FINAL-PLAN
------------------------------
I don’t yet have the three required structured reports (perceiver_report, manipulator_report, observer_report). Please provide them so I can synthesize the PDDL domain and problem.

To make sure I produce a correct FastDownwards-compatible STRIPS domain + problem, please supply the reports in one message (or three), each including the following as appropriate:

- perceiver_report:
  - List of objects discovered (with types if known; otherwise I will use a default type like object).
  - Any initial facts discovered (predicates and their truth).
  - Any naming variants or ambiguous object labels that should be resolved.

- manipulator_report:
  - For each action name (paltry, sip, clip, wretched, memory, tightfisted) give:
    - parameter list (which object types or specific objects the action uses),
    - preconditions (as a list of predicates that must be true),
    - add effects (predicates that become true),
    - delete effects (predicates that become false).
  - If any action has constraints that are temporal or “would rather / avoid”, mark them explicitly; I will treat them as hard constraints (unavailable slots not free).

- observer_report:
  - Consolidated initial state (if there were alternatives, the observer’s consolidation should be used).
  - The goal to achieve (explicit predicate list).
  - Any additional constraints or exclusivity rules (e.g., “agent A must not perform action X if Y”).

Notes and tips for your input:
- Use predicate names exactly as you want them to appear in the PDDL (e.g., (at robot room1), (holding cup)).
- If you want types, specify e.g., cup:cup, room:room. If no types, I will declare a single type object and put everything there.
- If any action parameters require specific objects (not types), indicate that.
- If there are temporal/ordering constraints between actions, state them explicitly; STRIPS has no native time, so I will encode them as preconditions if they must hold (e.g., to force action B after A, make B require a predicate that A adds).
- If there are conflicts between perceiver_report and observer_report about the initial facts, I will prefer observer_report as you requested.

Once you supply the three reports, I will:
- Resolve naming ambiguities (prefer observer where it consolidates).
- Keep each action distinct and implement the provided preconditions/effects exactly.
- Enumerate objects from the reports.
- Produce one PDDL domain (enclosed in <domain>...</domain>) and one PDDL problem (enclosed in <problem>...</problem>) compatible with FastDownwards (STRIPS subset).

NATURAL-PLAN sas_plan_1
------------------------------
Below is a clear, step-by-step, human-readable execution of the given PDDL plan. Each step matches the PDDL action exactly (same action name and object arguments), shows a timestamp (start time) and duration (assumed 1.0 time unit each), lists the main preconditions that enabled the action, and shows the immediate effects (what predicate was added and what was removed). The sequence is presented in order and the final goal is shown satisfied at the end.

Step 1 — t=0.0s (duration 1.0)
Action: clip object_11 object_5 object_9
- Preconditions (satisfied before this step): hand(object_11), sneeze(object_5), texture(object_9), next(object_5, object_9), next(object_11, object_9)
- Effects: add vase(object_11, object_5); remove next(object_11, object_9)

Step 2 — t=1.0s (duration 1.0)
Action: wretched object_5 object_9 object_8 object_3
- Preconditions: sneeze(object_5), texture(object_9), texture(object_8), stupendous(object_3), next(object_5, object_9), collect(object_9, object_3), collect(object_8, object_3)
- Effects: add next(object_5, object_8); remove next(object_5, object_9)

Step 3 — t=2.0s (duration 1.0)
Action: tightfisted object_11 object_5 object_8
- Preconditions: hand(object_11), sneeze(object_5), texture(object_8), next(object_5, object_8), vase(object_11, object_5)
- Effects: add next(object_11, object_8); remove vase(object_11, object_5)

Step 4 — t=3.0s (duration 1.0)
Action: clip object_10 object_4 object_7
- Preconditions: hand(object_10), sneeze(object_4), texture(object_7), next(object_4, object_7), next(object_10, object_7)
- Effects: add vase(object_10, object_4); remove next(object_10, object_7)

Step 5 — t=4.0s (duration 1.0)
Action: sip object_12 object_1 object_8
- Preconditions: hand(object_12), cats(object_1), texture(object_8), next(object_12, object_8), next(object_1, object_8)
- Effects: add vase(object_12, object_1); remove next(object_12, object_8)

Step 6 — t=5.0s (duration 1.0)
Action: memory object_1 object_8 object_6
- Preconditions: cats(object_1), spring(object_8), spring(object_6), next(object_1, object_8)
- Effects: add next(object_1, object_6); remove next(object_1, object_8)

Step 7 — t=6.0s (duration 1.0)
Action: paltry object_12 object_1 object_6
- Preconditions: hand(object_12), cats(object_1), texture(object_6), vase(object_12, object_1), next(object_1, object_6)
- Effects: add next(object_12, object_6); remove vase(object_12, object_1)

Step 8 — t=7.0s (duration 1.0)
Action: wretched object_4 object_7 object_6 object_2
- Preconditions: sneeze(object_4), texture(object_7), texture(object_6), stupendous(object_2), next(object_4, object_7), collect(object_7, object_2), collect(object_6, object_2)
- Effects: add next(object_4, object_6); remove next(object_4, object_7)

Step 9 — t=8.0s (duration 1.0)
Action: clip object_12 object_4 object_6
- Preconditions: hand(object_12), sneeze(object_4), texture(object_6), next(object_4, object_6), next(object_12, object_6)
- Effects: add vase(object_12, object_4); remove next(object_12, object_6)

Step 10 — t=9.0s (duration 1.0)
Action: tightfisted object_10 object_4 object_6
- Preconditions: hand(object_10), sneeze(object_4), texture(object_6), next(object_4, object_6), vase(object_10, object_4)
- Effects: add next(object_10, object_6); remove vase(object_10, object_4)

Step 11 — t=10.0s (duration 1.0)
Action: wretched object_4 object_6 object_7 object_2
- Preconditions: sneeze(object_4), texture(object_6), texture(object_7), stupendous(object_2), next(object_4, object_6), collect(object_6, object_2), collect(object_7, object_2)
- Effects: add next(object_4, object_7); remove next(object_4, object_6)

Step 12 — t=11.0s (duration 1.0)
Action: tightfisted object_12 object_4 object_7
- Preconditions: hand(object_12), sneeze(object_4), texture(object_7), next(object_4, object_7), vase(object_12, object_4)
- Effects: add next(object_12, object_7); remove vase(object_12, object_4)

Final state highlights (after Step 12)
- next(object_10, object_6) — achieved by Step 10
- next(object_11, object_8) — achieved by Step 3
- next(object_12, object_7) — achieved by Step 12
- next(object_13, object_9) — unchanged from the initial state

Goal check
- Required goal predicates:
  - next object_10 object_6 — present
  - next object_11 object_8 — present
  - next object_12 object_7 — present
  - next object_13 object_9 — present
All four goal predicates are satisfied by the final state after Step 12.

Notes
- Each step above corresponds exactly to one action in the supplied PDDL plan (12 actions total).
- I assigned 1.0 time unit duration to each action and listed cumulative start times for clarity; the original plan did not specify durations, so these timestamps are illustrative to satisfy the request to report time/duration when possible.
