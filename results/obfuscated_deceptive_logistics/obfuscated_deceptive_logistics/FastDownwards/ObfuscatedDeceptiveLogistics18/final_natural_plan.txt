Below is a clear, step-by-step, human-readable rendition of the provided plan. I keep each action exactly as in the plan, in the same order, and provide an estimated timestamp/duration for each step (assumed duration = 1 time unit per action). For each step I state the action, its parameters, a short plain-language description, and the immediate effect on the relevant predicates (as implied by the domain).

Timeline convention: step n starts at time n-1 and finishes at time n. Total plan cost reported at the end.

Step 1 — time 0.0 → 1.0
Action: (player-clip object_10 object_4 object_7)
Plain description: The player executes the clip action with a = object_10, b = object_4, c = object_7.
Expected preconditions (checked before executing): hand(object_10), sneeze(object_4), texture(object_7), next(object_4, object_7), next(object_10, object_7).
Immediate effects: add vase(object_10, object_4); remove next(object_10, object_7).

Step 2 — time 1.0 → 2.0
Action: (player-clip object_12 object_4 object_8)
Plain description: The player executes clip with a = object_12, b = object_4, c = object_8.
Expected preconditions: hand(object_12), sneeze(object_4), texture(object_8), next(object_4, object_8), next(object_12, object_8).
Immediate effects: add vase(object_12, object_4); remove next(object_12, object_8).

Step 3 — time 2.0 → 3.0
Action: (player-tightfisted object_12 object_4 object_7)
Plain description: The player executes tightfisted with a = object_12, b = object_4, c = object_7.
Expected preconditions: hand(object_12), sneeze(object_4), texture(object_7), next(object_4, object_7), vase(object_12, object_4).
Immediate effects: add next(object_12, object_7); remove vase(object_12, object_4).

Step 4 — time 3.0 → 4.0
Action: (player-wretched object_4 object_7 object_6 object_1)
Plain description: The player executes wretched with a = object_4, b = object_7, c = object_6, d = object_1.
Expected preconditions: sneeze(object_4), texture(object_7), texture(object_6), stupendous(object_1), next(object_4, object_7), collect(object_7, object_1), collect(object_6, object_1).
Immediate effects: add next(object_4, object_6); remove next(object_4, object_7).

Step 5 — time 4.0 → 5.0
Action: (player-clip object_11 object_4 object_6)
Plain description: The player executes clip with a = object_11, b = object_4, c = object_6.
Expected preconditions: hand(object_11), sneeze(object_4), texture(object_6), next(object_4, object_6), next(object_11, object_6).
Immediate effects: add vase(object_11, object_4); remove next(object_11, object_6).

Step 6 — time 5.0 → 6.0
Action: (player-tightfisted object_10 object_4 object_6)
Plain description: The player executes tightfisted with a = object_10, b = object_4, c = object_6.
Expected preconditions: hand(object_10), sneeze(object_4), texture(object_6), next(object_4, object_6), vase(object_10, object_4).
Immediate effects: add next(object_10, object_6); remove vase(object_10, object_4).

Step 7 — time 6.0 → 7.0
Action: (player-clip object_11 object_5 object_9)
Plain description: The player executes clip with a = object_11, b = object_5, c = object_9.
Expected preconditions: hand(object_11), sneeze(object_5), texture(object_9), next(object_5, object_9), next(object_11, object_9).
Immediate effects: add vase(object_11, object_5); remove next(object_11, object_9).

Step 8 — time 7.0 → 8.0
Action: (player-wretched object_5 object_9 object_10 object_2)
Plain description: The player executes wretched with a = object_5, b = object_9, c = object_10, d = object_2.
Expected preconditions: sneeze(object_5), texture(object_9), texture(object_10), stupendous(object_2), next(object_5, object_9), collect(object_9, object_2), collect(object_10, object_2).
Immediate effects: add next(object_5, object_10); remove next(object_5, object_9).

Step 9 — time 8.0 → 9.0
Action: (player-tightfisted object_11 object_5 object_10)
Plain description: The player executes tightfisted with a = object_11, b = object_5, c = object_10.
Expected preconditions: hand(object_11), sneeze(object_5), texture(object_10), next(object_5, object_10), vase(object_11, object_5).
Immediate effects: add next(object_11, object_10); remove vase(object_11, object_5).

Step 10 — time 9.0 → 10.0
Action: (player-tightfisted object_11 object_4 object_8)
Plain description: The player executes tightfisted with a = object_11, b = object_4, c = object_8.
Expected preconditions: hand(object_11), sneeze(object_4), texture(object_8), next(object_4, object_8), vase(object_11, object_4).
Immediate effects: add next(object_11, object_8); remove vase(object_11, object_4).

Final verification (time = 10.0)
Goal facts required:
- next(object_10, object_6) — achieved at Step 6.
- next(object_11, object_8)  — achieved at Step 10.
- next(object_12, object_7)  — achieved at Step 3.
- next(object_13, object_9)  — note: this fact was already true in the initial state (next object_13 object_9) and was not removed by the plan, so it remains true.
- next(object_11, object_10) — achieved at Step 9.

Total plan cost reported in the original plan: 10 (unit cost). The timeline above spans 10 time units (0.0 → 10.0) assuming each action takes 1 unit.

Notes and assumptions (kept minimal and consistent with the provided domain/problem):
- Each action description assumes the domain effects and preconditions exactly as encoded in the provided PDDL domain (player-clip, player-tightfisted, player-wretched).
- Timestamps are an assumed uniform duration (1.0) per action for readability; the original plan only specified ordering and unit cost.
- No actions were added, removed, or reordered — the sequence matches the provided plan exactly.
