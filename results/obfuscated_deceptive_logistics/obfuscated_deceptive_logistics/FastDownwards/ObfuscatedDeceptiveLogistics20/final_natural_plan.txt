Summary schedule (sequential execution, each action = 1.0 time unit). The steps below follow the given plan exactly and report preconditions used and effects produced. Start time t = 0.0.

1) Step 1 — clip_a object_12 object_4 object_10
   - Time: t = 0.0 → 1.0
   - Action (clip_A ?h ?s ?t) with ?h=object_12, ?s=object_4, ?t=object_10
   - Preconditions checked: (hand object_12), (sneeze object_4), (texture object_10), (next object_4 object_10), (next object_12 object_10)
   - Effects applied: add (vase object_12 object_4); delete (next object_12 object_10)

2) Step 2 — wretched_a object_4 object_10 object_11 object_3
   - Time: t = 1.0 → 2.0
   - Action (wretched_A ?s ?t1 ?t2 ?st) with ?s=object_4, ?t1=object_10, ?t2=object_11, ?st=object_3
   - Preconditions checked: (sneeze object_4), (texture object_10), (texture object_11), (stupendous object_3), (next object_4 object_10), (collect object_10 object_3), (collect object_11 object_3)
   - Effects applied: add (next object_4 object_11); delete (next object_4 object_10)

3) Step 3 — tightfisted_a object_12 object_4 object_11
   - Time: t = 2.0 → 3.0
   - Action (tightfisted_A ?h ?s ?t) with ?h=object_12, ?s=object_4, ?t=object_11
   - Preconditions checked: (hand object_12), (sneeze object_4), (texture object_11), (next object_4 object_11), (vase object_12 object_4)
   - Effects applied: add (next object_12 object_11); delete (vase object_12 object_4)
   - Milestone: Achieves goal (next object_12 object_11) for analyst_B now true.

4) Step 4 — wretched_a object_5 object_9 object_8 object_2
   - Time: t = 3.0 → 4.0
   - Action (wretched_A ?s ?t1 ?t2 ?st) with ?s=object_5, ?t1=object_9, ?t2=object_8, ?st=object_2
   - Preconditions checked: (sneeze object_5), (texture object_9), (texture object_8), (stupendous object_2), (next object_5 object_9), (collect object_9 object_2), (collect object_8 object_2)
   - Effects applied: add (next object_5 object_8); delete (next object_5 object_9)

5) Step 5 — clip_a object_11 object_5 object_8
   - Time: t = 4.0 → 5.0
   - Action (clip_A ?h ?s ?t) with ?h=object_11, ?s=object_5, ?t=object_8
   - Preconditions checked: (hand object_11), (sneeze object_5), (texture object_8), (next object_5 object_8), (next object_11 object_8)
   - Effects applied: add (vase object_11 object_5); delete (next object_11 object_8)

6) Step 6 — wretched_a object_5 object_8 object_9 object_2
   - Time: t = 5.0 → 6.0
   - Action (wretched_A ?s ?t1 ?t2 ?st) with ?s=object_5, ?t1=object_8, ?t2=object_9, ?st=object_2
   - Preconditions checked: (sneeze object_5), (texture object_8), (texture object_9), (stupendous object_2), (next object_5 object_8), (collect object_8 object_2), (collect object_9 object_2)
   - Effects applied: add (next object_5 object_9); delete (next object_5 object_8)

7) Step 7 — tightfisted_a object_11 object_5 object_9
   - Time: t = 6.0 → 7.0
   - Action (tightfisted_A ?h ?s ?t) with ?h=object_11, ?s=object_5, ?t=object_9
   - Preconditions checked: (hand object_11), (sneeze object_5), (texture object_9), (next object_5 object_9), (vase object_11 object_5)
   - Effects applied: add (next object_11 object_9); delete (vase object_11 object_5)
   - Milestone: Achieves goal (next object_11 object_9) for analyst_A now true.

Final status
- Both declared goals are satisfied in the final state:
  - (next object_12 object_11) became true at the end of Step 3.
  - (next object_11 object_9) became true at the end of Step 7.
- Total actions executed: 7
- Sequential makespan: 7.0 time units
- Reported cost (unit cost per action): 7

This step-by-step sequence matches the provided plan exactly, lists the times, verifies preconditions at execution, and records the effects that lead to the two required goal atoms.
