Plan (human-readable, following the provided PDDL plan exactly)

Assumed clock start: 00:00:00.000

Step 1 — 00:00:00.000 (duration ~0.0s)
Action: set-next object_11 object_7
Effect: assert next(object_11, object_7)

Step 2 — 00:00:01.000 (duration ~0.0s)
Action: set-next object_12 object_11
Effect: assert next(object_12, object_11)

Step 3 — 00:00:02.000 (duration ~0.0s)
Action: set-next object_12 object_5
Effect: assert next(object_12, object_5)

Execution summary:
- Actions executed in the exact order from the plan (3 actions; unit cost each).
- Total reported plan cost: 3.
- Final achieved relations (goals satisfied): next object_12 object_11, next object_11 object_7, next object_12 object_5.
