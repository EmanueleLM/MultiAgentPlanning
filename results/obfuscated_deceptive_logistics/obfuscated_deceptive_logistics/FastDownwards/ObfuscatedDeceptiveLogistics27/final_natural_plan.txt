Summary: the following is a human-readable, step-by-step execution of the provided plan. Each step lists a timestamp (start time in integer units), a unit duration (1 time unit per action), the action name with its arguments, the role/type of each argument (where the domain gives one), the key preconditions checked at that moment (as required by the domain), and the immediate effect(s) (adds and deletes). The plan length is 24 actions; total cost = 24 (1 per action). The sequence exactly matches the given plan; no actions were added or removed.

Final summary
- Actions executed: 24 (exactly as in the plan).
- Time: actions executed at integer start times 0..23, each of duration 1 (total makespan 24 time units if executed sequentially).
- Total cost reported by plan: 24 (unit cost per action).
- Goal facts achieved at the end (as required by the problem): next(object_12,object_6), next(object_13,object_10), next(object_14,object_11).
- Notes on compliance: every step above reproduces the action name and arguments exactly from the provided plan, and lists the domain-specified argument roles, preconditions, and immediate add/delete effects so the effects chain is traceable.
