Goal: achieve (next object_7 object_5) and (next object_8 object_5).

Plan (ordered steps). Each step lists a short timestamp, the action with parameters, the action’s preconditions (as checked at that moment), and the effects applied.

Step 1 — t=00:00 (duration ~1s)
Action: sip object_8 object_0 object_6
- Parameters mapping: ?o0=object_8, ?o1=object_0, ?o2=object_6
- Preconditions (required before performing): hand object_8, cats object_0, texture object_6, next object_8 object_6, next object_0 object_6.
  - These are satisfied in the given initial state: hand(object_8) and next(object_8,object_6) are present; cats(object_0), texture(object_6), next(object_0,object_6) are present.
- Effects (applied immediately): add vase object_8 object_0; remove next object_8 object_6.
- Resulting local change: vase(object_8,object_0) becomes true; next(object_8,object_6) becomes false.

Step 2 — t=00:01 (duration ~1s)
Action: sip object_7 object_0 object_6
- Parameters mapping: ?o0=object_7, ?o1=object_0, ?o2=object_6
- Preconditions: hand object_7, cats object_0, texture object_6, next object_7 object_6, next object_0 object_6.
  - These are satisfied by the initial state (hand(object_7), next(object_7,object_6), cats(object_0), texture(object_6), next(object_0,object_6)).
- Effects: add vase object_7 object_0; remove next object_7 object_6.
- Resulting local change: vase(object_7,object_0) becomes true; next(object_7,object_6) becomes false.

Step 3 — t=00:02 (duration ~1s)
Action: memory object_0 object_6 object_5
- Parameters mapping: ?o0=object_0, ?o1=object_6, ?o2=object_5
- Preconditions: cats object_0, spring object_6, spring object_5, next object_0 object_6.
  - These are satisfied: cats(object_0) and next(object_0,object_6) were in the initial state and spring(object_6), spring(object_5) are present.
- Effects: add next object_0 object_5; remove next object_0 object_6.
- Resulting local change: next(object_0,object_5) becomes true; next(object_0,object_6) becomes false (so any earlier reliance on next(object_0,object_6) is replaced by next(object_0,object_5)).

Step 4 — t=00:03 (duration ~1s)
Action: paltry object_8 object_0 object_5
- Parameters mapping: ?o0=object_8, ?o1=object_0, ?o2=object_5
- Preconditions: hand object_8, cats object_0, texture object_5, vase object_8 object_0, next object_0 object_5.
  - After previous steps: vase(object_8,object_0) was added in Step 1, and memory added next(object_0,object_5) in Step 3; hand(object_8), cats(object_0), texture(object_5) are in the initial facts — so preconditions are satisfied.
- Effects: add next object_8 object_5; remove vase object_8 object_0.
- Resulting local change: next(object_8,object_5) becomes true; vase(object_8,object_0) becomes false.

Step 5 — t=00:04 (duration ~1s)
Action: paltry object_7 object_0 object_5
- Parameters mapping: ?o0=object_7, ?o1=object_0, ?o2=object_5
- Preconditions: hand object_7, cats object_0, texture object_5, vase object_7 object_0, next object_0 object_5.
  - After previous steps: vase(object_7,object_0) was added in Step 2, and next(object_0,object_5) exists from Step 3; hand(object_7), cats(object_0), texture(object_5) are present — so preconditions are satisfied.
- Effects: add next object_7 object_5; remove vase object_7 object_0.
- Resulting local change: next(object_7,object_5) becomes true; vase(object_7,object_0) becomes false.

Final state (relevant facts): next object_8 object_5 and next object_7 object_5 are both true (the plan’s goal achieved). Total steps: 5 (unit cost per step; cumulative duration ~5s in the timeline above).
