Summary: execute the four actions in the given plan in order. I assume each action takes 1 time unit; timestamps show start time for each action. All preconditions listed come from the provided initial facts and earlier effects; no extra actions are added.

Step 1 — t = 0s (duration 1s)
Action: memory object_1 object_6 object_7
Natural description: Move the "next" relation for object_1 from object_6 to object_7.
Preconditions checked (before execution):
- cats object_1 — true in initial state
- spring object_6 — true in initial state
- spring object_7 — true in initial state
- next object_1 object_6 — true in initial state
Effects (applied at completion):
- add next object_1 object_7
- remove next object_1 object_6

State note after Step 1: next object_1 object_7 is true; next object_1 object_6 is no longer true.

Step 2 — t = 1s (duration 1s)
Action: sip object_9 object_1 object_7
Natural description: Create a vase relation between object_9 and object_1 by using the shared relation to object_7; in effect object_9 forms vase(object_9, object_1) and loses its connection to object_7.
Preconditions checked (before execution):
- hand object_9 — true in initial state
- cats object_1 — true in initial state
- texture object_7 — true in initial state
- next object_9 object_7 — true in initial state
- next object_1 object_7 — true (established by Step 1)
Effects (applied at completion):
- add vase object_9 object_1
- remove next object_9 object_7

State note after Step 2: vase(object_9, object_1) is true; next object_9 object_7 is no longer true.

Step 3 — t = 2s (duration 1s)
Action: memory object_1 object_7 object_6
Natural description: Move the "next" relation for object_1 back from object_7 to object_6.
Preconditions checked (before execution):
- cats object_1 — true in initial state
- spring object_7 — true in initial state
- spring object_6 — true in initial state
- next object_1 object_7 — true (established by Step 1)
Effects (applied at completion):
- add next object_1 object_6
- remove next object_1 object_7

State note after Step 3: next object_1 object_6 is true again; next object_1 object_7 is no longer true.

Step 4 — t = 3s (duration 1s)
Action: paltry object_9 object_1 object_6
Natural description: Using the vase between object_9 and object_1 plus object_1’s connection to object_6, create next object_9 object_6 and remove the vase between object_9 and object_1.
Preconditions checked (before execution):
- hand object_9 — true in initial state
- cats object_1 — true in initial state
- texture object_6 — true in initial state
- vase object_9 object_1 — true (established by Step 2)
- next object_1 object_6 — true (established by Step 3)
Effects (applied at completion):
- add next object_9 object_6
- remove vase object_9 object_1

State note after Step 4: next object_9 object_6 is true.

Final verification (t = 4s)
- Goal for planner_A: (next object_8 object_7) and (next object_9 object_6)
  - next object_8 object_7 was true in the initial state and was never removed ⇒ true.
  - next object_9 object_6 was added in Step 4 ⇒ true.
- Both goal conjuncts are satisfied.

Total plan cost: 4 (four unit-cost actions).
