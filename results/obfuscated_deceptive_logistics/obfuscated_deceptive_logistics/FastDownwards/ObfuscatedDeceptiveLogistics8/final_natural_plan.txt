Summary: execute the given 3-step plan in order. I list each step with a short timestamp (sequential, 1 time unit each), the parameter roles, required preconditions (checked against the initial state and intermediate effects), and the effects produced. The plan achieves the goal (next object_10 object_5 and next object_9 object_7).

Step 1 — t = 0.0 (duration 1.0)
Action: clip object_9 object_4 object_8
- Parameter roles: hand = object_9, sneeze = object_4, texture = object_8
- Required preconditions (state before step):
  - (hand object_9) — true in init
  - (sneeze object_4) — true in init
  - (texture object_8) — true in init
  - (next object_4 object_8) — true in init
  - (next object_9 object_8) — true in init
- Effect (applied at completion of this step):
  - Add: (vase object_9 object_4)
  - Delete: (next object_9 object_8)
- State changes after step 1 (not exhaustive): (vase object_9 object_4) becomes true; (next object_9 object_8) is removed.

Step 2 — t = 1.0 (duration 1.0)
Action: wretched object_4 object_8 object_7 object_2
- Parameter roles: sneeze = object_4, texture t1 = object_8, texture t2 = object_7, stupendous = object_2
- Required preconditions (state before step):
  - (sneeze object_4) — true (unchanged)
  - (texture object_8) — true
  - (texture object_7) — true
  - (stupendous object_2) — true in init
  - (next object_4 object_8) — true (remained true after step 1)
  - (collect object_8 object_2) — true in init
  - (collect object_7 object_2) — true in init
- Effect (applied at completion of this step):
  - Add: (next object_4 object_7)
  - Delete: (next object_4 object_8)
- State changes after step 2: (next object_4 object_7) becomes true; (next object_4 object_8) is removed.

Step 3 — t = 2.0 (duration 1.0)
Action: tightfisted object_9 object_4 object_7
- Parameter roles: hand = object_9, sneeze = object_4, texture = object_7
- Required preconditions (state before step):
  - (hand object_9) — true (unchanged)
  - (sneeze object_4) — true
  - (texture object_7) — true
  - (next object_4 object_7) — true (added by step 2)
  - (vase object_9 object_4) — true (added by step 1)
- Effect (applied at completion of this step):
  - Add: (next object_9 object_7)
  - Delete: (vase object_9 object_4)
- State changes after step 3: (next object_9 object_7) becomes true; (vase object_9 object_4) is removed.

Final outcome (after all 3 steps)
- (next object_10 object_5) — was true in the initial state and remained true
- (next object_9 object_7) — made true by step 3
Both goal conditions (next object_10 object_5) and (next object_9 object_7) are satisfied.
Plan cost: 3 (three unit-cost actions).
