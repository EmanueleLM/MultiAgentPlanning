    "response": "Summary answer\n- For the first STATEMENT (where next object_1 object_6 is initially true), your four-step plan is valid and achieves the goal next object_8 object_6.\n- For the second STATEMENT (where next object_1 object_7 is initially true instead), the plan as written is not applicable: the first action memory object_1 object_6 object_7 fails because it requires next object_1 object_6, which is not present. I give a corrected 3-step plan that does achieve the goal from the second initial state.\n\nDetails \u2014 first STATEMENT (initial had next 1 6)\nPlan:\n1) memory object_1 object_6 object_7\n   - Preconditions: cats 1, spring 6, spring 7, next 1 6 \u2014 all true initially.\n   - Effects: add next 1 7, delete next 1 6.\n2) sip object_8 object_1 object_7\n   - Preconditions: hand 8, cats 1, texture 7, next 8 7 (initial), next 1 7 (created in step 1) \u2014 satisfied.\n   - Effects: add vase 8 1, delete next 8 7.\n3) memory object_1 object_7 object_6\n   - Preconditions: cats 1, spring 7, spring 6, next 1 7 \u2014 satisfied (next 1 7 created in step 1 and not yet deleted).\n   - Effects: add next 1 6, delete next 1 7.\n4) paltry object_8 object_1 object_6\n   - Preconditions: hand 8, cats 1, texture 6, vase 8 1 (from step 2), next 1 6 (from step 3) \u2014 satisfied.\n   - Effects: add next 8 6 (goal), delete vase 8 1.\n\nResult: next object_8 object_6 is produced.\n\nDetails \u2014 second STATEMENT (initial has next 1 7 but not next 1 6)\n- The first planned action memory object_1 object_6 object_7 requires next 1 6 \u2014 not present, so the plan fails immediately.\n\nCorrected minimal plan from the second initial state\nUse:\n1) sip object_8 object_1 object_7\n2) memory object_1 object_7 object_6\n3) paltry object_8 object_1 object_6\n\nWhy this works:\n- Step 1 (sip 8 1 7) is applicable because hand 8, cats 1, texture 7, next 8 7 and next 1 7 are all true initially. Effects: vase 8 1 becomes true, next 8 7 is deleted.\n- Step 2 (memory 1 7 6) is applicable because next 1 7 is still true after step 1. Effects: next 1 6 becomes true (and next 1 7 deleted).\n- Step 3 (paltry 8 1 6) is applicable because hand 8, cats 1, texture 6, vase 8 1 (from step 1) and next 1 6 (from step 2) are true. Effects: next 8 6 is added (goal).\n\nIf you want, I can (a) produce a shortest plan for each initial state, (b) simulate intermediate fact sets step-by-step in full detail, or (c) search for alternative valid plans. Which would you like?"
