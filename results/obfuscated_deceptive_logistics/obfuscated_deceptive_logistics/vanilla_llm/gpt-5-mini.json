    "response": "Short answer\n- For the first initial state (where next object_1 object_6 is present) your plan is valid and achieves next object_8 object_6.\n- For the second initial state (where next object_1 object_7 instead of next object_1 object_6) the plan is not applicable (the first step fails) and, in fact, the goal next object_8 object_6 is unreachable from that second initial state under the given operators.\n\nDetails\n\n1) First initial state (next object_1 object_6 present)\nInitial relevant facts: next 1 6, next 8 7, hand 8, cats 1, texture 6 & 7, spring 6 & 7, etc.\n\nPlan execution:\n- Step 1: memory object_1 object_6 object_7\n  Pre: cats 1, spring 6, spring 7, next 1 6 \u2014 all true.\n  Effects: add next 1 7, delete next 1 6.\n  State now has next 1 7 (and next 8 7 still).\n- Step 2: sip object_8 object_1 object_7\n  Pre: hand 8, cats 1, texture 7, next 8 7, next 1 7 \u2014 all true.\n  Effects: add vase 8 1, delete next 8 7.\n- Step 3: memory object_1 object_7 object_6\n  Pre: cats 1, spring 7, spring 6, next 1 7 \u2014 all true.\n  Effects: add next 1 6, delete next 1 7.\n- Step 4: paltry object_8 object_1 object_6\n  Pre: hand 8, cats 1, texture 6, vase 8 1, next 1 6 \u2014 all true.\n  Effects: add next 8 6, delete vase 8 1.\n\nGoal next object_8 object_6 is produced at the last step. So the plan succeeds for the first initial set.\n\n2) Second initial state (next object_1 object_7, not next object_1 object_6)\n- The very first action in your plan is memory object_1 object_6 object_7, which requires next object_1 object_6. That precondition is false in the second initial state, so the plan is not applicable.\n\nReachability check / why the goal is unreachable from the second initial state\n- To create next 8 6 the only operators that add next 8 6 are:\n  - paltry(8, c, 6) \u2014 adds next 8 6 but requires vase 8 c and next c 6,\n  - tightfisted(8, s, 6) \u2014 adds next 8 6 but requires vase 8 s and next s 6,\n  (wretched and memory add next only when the first argument is a sneeze or cat; object_8 is only a hand, not a sneeze or cat).\n- So you first need a vase of the form vase 8 X.\n- The only operators that create vase 8 X are:\n  - sip(8, c, t) which creates vase 8 c, and\n  - clip(8, s, t) which creates vase 8 s.\n  Both sip and clip, however, require next 8 t as a precondition (they both require next object_0 object_2 where object_0 is the hand 8 and object_2 is the texture parameter). That means you already need some next 8 T in order to make a vase 8 X.\n- Thus there is a circular dependency: to get next 8 6 you need vase 8 X; to get vase 8 X you need next 8 T (some next with head 8); but none of the available operators can create any new next 8 Y without already having a suitable vase or being able to use an operator that itself needs next 8 Y. The only existing next with first argument 8 in the second initial state is next 8 7, but no operator lets you convert next 8 7 into next 8 6 (memory acts on cats, wretched/tightfisted/paltry/clip/sip all require either vase 8 X or next 8 6 itself). There is no operator that turns next 8 7 into next 8 6 except one that would already require next 8 6.\n- Therefore, under the given action definitions and the second initial state, next object_8 object_6 cannot be produced.\n\nIf you want\n- I can search for a plan if you allow adding or changing initial facts (for example if next object_1 object_6 or next object_8 object_6 were true initially, or if object_8 had the cats or sneeze property).\n- Or I can try to find the minimal initial-fact change that would make the goal reachable."

To add next object_8 object_6 we must instantiate o0 = object_8, o2 = object_6.\n\n- memory(object_8, \u2026) requires cats object_8, but cats holds only for object_0 in the initial state, so memory cannot be used with object_8.\n\n- wretched(object_8, \u2026) requires sneeze object_8, but sneeze is true only for object_3 and object_4, so wretched cannot be used with object_8.\n\n- paltry(object_8, o1, object_6) requires vase object_8 o1 (and cats o1). The only cats fact is cats object_0, so the only paltry that could produce next 8 6 is paltry(object_8, object_0, object_6). That requires vase object_8 object_0. Vase facts can only be created by sip or clip with first argument equal to a hand (hand objects are 7 and 8). To create vase object_8 object_0:\n  - clip(object_8, object_0, x) would require sneeze object_0 (not present), so clip cannot produce vase 8 0.\n  - sip(object_8, object_0, x) would require a single x with next object_8 x and next object_0 x both true. Initially next object_8 x is only x=object_5, and next object_0 x is only x=object_6 \u2014 there is no common x. The only way to make such an overlap would require changing next object_0 or next object_8 first, but all available changes either require cats or sneeze on object_8 (which we do not have) or would delete the needed next facts (memory on object_0 would delete next object_0 object_6). So vase object_8 object_0 cannot be produced without destroying the needed next object_0 object_6 precondition for paltry.\n\n- tightfisted(object_8, o1, object_6) requires vase object_8 o1 and sneeze o1. The only sneeze objects are 3 and 4, so candidates are o1 = 3 or 4.\n  - For o1 = 4 we would need vase 8 4. To create vase 8 4 by clip(8,4,x) we would need an x such that next 4 x and next 8 x both hold. Initially next 4 6 and next 8 5 \u2014 no common x \u2014 so vase 8 4 cannot be created.\n  - For o1 = 3 we would need vase 8 3. clip(8,3,5) is applicable (hand 8, sneeze 3, texture 5, next 3 5, next 8 5 exist) and would produce vase 8 3, but then tightfisted(8,3,6) or paltry(8,3,6) would require next 3 6, which is not present and cannot be generated: wretched to change next 3 5 \u2192 next 3 6 would itself require next 3 6 as a pre or collect facts that do not exist in a compatible way. So producing vase 8 3 does not lead to next 8 6.\n\nGiven all avenues, there is no sequence of available actions that yields next object_8 object_6 while preserving/meeting the applicable preconditions. Therefore the goal set {next object_7 object_6, next object_8 object_6} is unreachable from the given initial state.\n\nIf you want, I can (a) produce the maximal partial plan that achieves next object_7 object_6 (trivial: do nothing), (b) show the attempted action sequences I explored in more detail, or (c) search again under a different assumption (e.g., allowing reuse of deleted next facts) \u2014 tell me which."

No action produces cats or sneeze or vase for object_9 from other objects.\n\nTherefore, under the given initial facts and the available actions, next object_9 object_6 is unreachable.

    "response": "Short answer: No valid plan exists from the given initial state to achieve next object_9 object_7.\n\nReasoning (sketch of a small proof):\n\n1) Which actions can achieve next object_9 object_7?\n   - Only paltry or tightfisted can add next with first argument object_9:\n     - paltry(9, a, 7) requires: hand 9, cats a, texture 7, vase 9 a, next a 7.\n     - tightfisted(9, a, 7) requires: hand 9, sneeze a, texture 7, next a 7, vase 9 a.\n   - So we must first obtain some vase object_9 a and a corresponding next a 7, with a being either a cats object (for paltry) or a sneeze object (for tightfisted).\n\n2) Which a are possible given predicates in the domain?\n   - cats facts: only cats object_0 \u2192 paltry could only use a = object_0.\n   - sneeze facts: sneeze object_3 and sneeze object_4 \u2192 tightfisted could only use a = object_3 or object_4.\n\n   So the only candidate a values are object_0, object_3 or object_4. In any case we must produce vase(9,a).\n\n3) How can we produce vase(9,a)?\n   - Only sip and clip add vase facts.\n   - sip(9,a,x) requires cats a (so a must be object_0), texture x, and both next 9 x and next a x. That requires some x with both next 9 x and next 0 x. In the initial state next 9 x is true only for x = object_6, and next 0 x is true only for x = object_5 \u2014 there is no common x. Moreover, no operator can create a next fact with first argument 9 unless a vase(9,...) already exists (tightfisted or paltry would do that, but they're the ones we need to enable in the first place). So sip cannot produce vase(9,0) from the given start.\n   - clip(9,a,x) requires hand 9, sneeze a, texture x, next a x and next 9 x. The only next 9 x present initially is x = object_6. So clip could produce vase(9,a) only for some a that has next a object_6. We can create next object_3 object_6 by applying wretched(3,5,6,1) (all its preconditions are satisfied: next 3 5 exists, texture 5 & 6 and collect 5 1 & collect 6 1 and stupendous 1 exist). So vase(9,object_3) can be made via:\n       wretched(3,5,6,1) \u2192 next 3 6,\n       then clip(9,3,6) \u2192 vase 9 3.\n     That is the only reachable vase(9,a) given next 9 6 is the only initial next with first arg 9.\n\n4) Can we finish from vase(9,3)?\n   - To use tightfisted(9,3,7) we need next 3 7 (and texture 7, sneeze 3, vase 9 3). We do have texture 7 and sneeze 3, but we do NOT have next 3 7 initially.\n   - Can we create next 3 7? The only operator that can create next 3 7 is wretched(3, p, 7, s) for some p,s (wretched adds next o0 o2). A wretched(3,p,7,s) needs collect p s and collect 7 s (same s). From the initial collect facts we have collect 5 1 and collect 7 2 (collect 6 1 and collect 8 2 also). There is no single stupendous/index s such that both collect 5 s and collect 7 s (or collect 6 s and collect 7 s, etc.) hold for the same s. Memory cannot help because memory requires cats as first arg (cats only object_0). Therefore next 3 7 cannot be created.\n   - paltry(9,3,7) is impossible because paltry requires cats 3 and cats 3 is false.\n\n5) Conclusion\n   - The only vase(9,a) that can be produced from the initial state is vase(9,3).\n   - From vase(9,3) there is no way to obtain the required next 3 7, so neither tightfisted nor paltry can produce next 9 7.\n   - Therefore no valid sequence of actions exists from the given initial state that achieves next object_9 object_7.\n\nIf you want, I can (a) produce the maximal partial plan that gets you as far as possible (e.g., wretched(3,5,6,1) then clip(9,3,6) to produce vase(9,3)), or (b) explore small changes to the initial facts (e.g., adding a suitable collect or spring fact) that would make a full plan possible.

    "response": "Thanks \u2014 I checked reachability and produced the maximal valid plan. Short answer: you can achieve next object_10 object_7, but next object_9 object_7 and next object_11 object_7 are unreachable from the given initial facts and available actions. I show a correct plan for object_10 and then give the reasoning why the other two goals cannot be achieved.\n\nPlan that achieves next object_10 object_7\n1. wretched object_4 object_7 object_8 object_2\n   - Pre: sneeze 4, texture 7, texture 8, stupendous 2, next 4 7, collect 7 2, collect 8 2 \u2014 all true initially.\n   - Effect: next 4 8 becomes true (and next 4 7 is deleted).\n2. clip object_10 object_4 object_8\n   - Pre: hand 10, sneeze 4, texture 8, next 4 8, next 10 8 \u2014 all true (next 10 8 is initial).\n   - Effect: vase 10 4 becomes true (and next 10 8 is deleted).\n3. wretched object_4 object_8 object_7 object_2\n   - Pre: sneeze 4, texture 8, texture 7, stupendous 2, next 4 8, collect 8 2, collect 7 2 \u2014 all true after step 1.\n   - Effect: next 4 7 becomes true again (and next 4 8 is deleted).\n4. tightfisted object_10 object_4 object_7\n   - Pre: hand 10, sneeze 4, texture 7, next 4 7, vase 10 4 \u2014 all true after steps above.\n   - Effect: next 10 7 becomes true (and vase 10 4 is deleted).\n\nAfter these four actions you have next object_10 object_7.\n\nWhy next object_9 object_7 and next object_11 object_7 are unreachable\n- The only actions that can create next a c are: wretched (subject a must have sneeze), memory (subject a must have cats), tightfisted (requires a vase a b + sneeze b + next b c), and paltry (requires vase and cats b). In your initial facts:\n  - sneeze holds only for objects 3 and 4, so wretched can only change next for a in {3,4}.\n  - cats holds only for object_0, so memory can only change next for a=0.\n  - paltry requires cats on the b parameter \u2014 here the single cat is object_0, so paltry can only act with b=0 (and creating vase a 0 is not possible given the other constraints).\n- For hand objects 9 and 11 (they are subjects we want to change), the only way to change their next is via tightfisted (which needs a vase a b and sneeze b). That forces b to be a sneeze object (3 or 4).\n  - If b=3, then tightfisted can only set next a c where c is whatever next 3 currently points to. From the collects and stupendous data you can only ever make next 3 be 5 or 6 (3\u2019s next is stuck in {5,6}), so using b=3 can only produce c in {5,6}.\n  - If b=4, tightfisted can only set next a c where c is whatever next 4 currently points to. From the collects/stupendous data 4\u2019s next is stuck in {7,8}, so b=4 can only produce c in {7,8}. But to create the required vase a 4 with clip you need next 4 c to equal the current next of a; for a=9 the current next is 5 and for a=11 it is 6. 4 cannot be made to point to 5 or 6 (it only toggles between 7 and 8), so you cannot create vase a 4 for those a.\n- Putting those constraints together: there is no sequence of allowed actions that results in next 9 7 or next 11 7 given your initial facts.\n\nIf you want, I can:\n- produce a minimal plan that achieves only the reachable goal(s) (done above), or\n- suggest minimal changes to the initial facts (e.g., adding cats or sneeze predicates or extra collect facts) that would make the full goal reachable and then produce a plan under those changed facts. Which would you prefer?"

The remaining required fact (next object_9 object_6) is still false.\n\nWhy next object_9 object_6 is unreachable\n- The only operators that can add a next(a,b) fact are paltry, wretched, memory and tightfisted.\n- memory requires cats(a) \u2014 cats is true only for object_0, not for object_9, so memory cannot add next object_9 ...\n- wretched requires sneeze(object_9) \u2014 sneeze is true only for object_3 and object_4, not object_9, so wretched cannot add next object_9 ...\n- paltry requires vase(object_9, x) and next(x,6) and cats(x). The only object with cats is object_0, so paltry would require vase(9,0) and next(0,6). There is no sequence of actions that can produce next(0,6) from the given springs/collect/stupendous facts (memory on object_0 can only produce next(0,7) given the available springs), so paltry cannot add next(9,6).\n- tightfisted requires vase(object_9, x) with sneeze(x) and next(x,6). The only x with sneeze are 3 and 4. Therefore tightfisted would require vase(9,3) or vase(9,4) and next(3,6) (or next(4,6)). Although next(3,6) is initially true, creating vase(9,3) or vase(9,4) via clip or sip is blocked by circular or unsatisfiable preconditions (clip to make vase(9,3) would require next(9,6) already, and sip to make vase(9,3) requires cats(3) which is false). Attempts to produce next(4,6) similarly fail because required collect/stupendous matches do not line up to allow a wretched to make 4->6.\n- In short: there is no operator applicable (alone or in any sequence) that can produce the required vase or cat or sneeze necessary to enable an operator to add next object_9 object_6. Therefore next object_9 object_6 is unreachable.\n\nIf you want, I can:\n- produce the explicit final state after the 5-step plan above,\n- search for any alternative partial plans, or\n- try to prove unreachable subgoal using a formal backward-chaining checklist step-by-step.
