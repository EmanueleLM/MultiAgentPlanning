PROBLEM
------------------------------
I am playing with a set of objects. Here are the actions I can do

Paltry object_0 object_1 object_2.

I have the following restrictions on my actions:
To perform paltry action, the following facts need to be true: hand object_0, cats object_1, texture object_2, vase object_0 object_1, and next object_1 object_2
Once paltry is performed the following facts will be true: next object_0 object_2
Once paltry is performed the following facts will be false: vase object_0 object_1
To perform sip action, the following facts need to be true: hand object_0, cats object_1, texture object_2, next object_0 object_2, and next object_1 object_2

To perform wretched action, the following facts need to be true: sneeze object_0, texture object_1, texture object_2, stupendous object_3, next object_0 object_1, collect object_1 object_3, and collect object_2 object_3
Once wretched is performed the following facts will be true: next object_0 object_2

NATURAL-PLAN sas_plan_0
------------------------------
Step 1 — (time 0.0 → 1.0; duration 1.0, cost = 1)
- Action: sip
- Agent: planner_agent
- Parameters (concrete binding): src = object_5, target = object_8, child = object_6
- Informal description: planner_agent reattaches child object_6 from its current parent object_5 to become the successor of object_8.

Preconditions required by sip:
1. (agent planner_agent) — planner_agent must exist as an actor.
   - Satisfied: present in the problem initial facts.
2. (next object_5 object_6) — child must currently be linked to src parent object_5.
   - Satisfied: initial facts include next object_5 object_6.
3. (succ-free object_8) — the target parent must be free to accept a successor.
   - Satisfied: initial facts include succ-free object_8.

Effects of the action (applied at the end of the step):
- Deletes: (next object_5 object_6) — the old link from object_5 to object_6 is removed.
- Adds: (next object_8 object_6) — a new link from object_8 to object_6 is created.
- Adds: (succ-free object_5) — object_5 becomes successor-free because it lost its child.
- Deletes (implicit in the sip schema): (succ-free object_8) — object_8 is no longer successor-free after receiving object_6.

State consequences relevant to the goal:
- After this action the fact (next object_8 object_6) holds, which exactly satisfies the planning goal.
- No preconditions were missing or ambiguous; all required facts were present in the initial state and no additional assumptions were needed.

Conclusion: Executing the single plan step sip planner_agent object_5 object_8 object_6 (duration 1.0) is valid from the given initial state and achieves the goal next object_8 object_6.
