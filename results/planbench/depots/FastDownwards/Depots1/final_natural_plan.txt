Here is the human-readable execution of the provided plan, with 1 time unit per action.

1) t=0–1: Perform sip object_8 object_1 object_7
   - Intuition: While holding object_8 and with cat object_1 at textured place object_7 where both are “next” to object_7, link object_8 to object_1 (as a vase relation), and give up object_8’s adjacency to object_7.
   - Resulting changes: add vase(object_8, object_1); delete next(object_8, object_7).

2) t=1–2: Perform memory object_1 object_7 object_6
   - Intuition: Move cat object_1’s adjacency from springy place object_7 to springy place object_6.
   - Resulting changes: add next(object_1, object_6); delete next(object_1, object_7).

3) t=2–3: Perform paltry object_8 object_1 object_6
   - Intuition: Using the vase link between object_8 and cat object_1, and with textured place object_6 where object_1 is now adjacent, move object_8 to be adjacent to object_6 and drop the vase link.
   - Resulting changes: add next(object_8, object_6); delete vase(object_8, object_1).

Outcome: Goal achieved at t=3 — next(object_8, object_6) is true. Total duration: 3 time units.
