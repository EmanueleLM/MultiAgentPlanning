PROBLEM
------------------------------
I have to plan the logistics of transporting crates between a number of depots and distributors via trucks that are loaded by hoists. Depots and distributors are directly connected by roads (trucks can drive between any two depots or distributors).

A depot is a type of place.
A distributor is a type of place.
A pallet is a type of surface.
A crate is a type of surface.

Here are the actions that can be performed:

Drive a truck from one place to another place.
Use a hoist to lift a crate from a surface at a place.
Use a hoist to drop a crate to a surface at a place.
Use a hoist to load a crate into a truck at a place.
Use a hoist to unload a crate from a truck at a place.

The following are the restrictions on the actions:
A truck can be driven from one place to another place only if the truck is at the origin place.
Once a truck has been driven from one place to another, it is not at the origin place and is at the destination place.
A crate can be lifted by a hoist only if the hoist is at the same place as the crate, the hoist is available, and the crate is clear.
Once a crate has been lifted by a hoist from a surface at a place, the crate is not at the place, the hoist is lifting the crate, the hoist is not available, the surface is clear, and the crate is not on the surface.
A crate can be dropped by a hoist to a surface only if the hoist and surface are both at the place, the surface is clear, and the hoist is lifting the crate.
Once a crate has been dropped by a hoist to a surface at a place, the hoist is available, the hoist is not lifting the crate, the crate is at the place, the surface is not clear, the crate is clear, and the crate is on the surface.
A crate can be loaded by a hoist onto a truck at a place only if the hoist is at the same place, the truck is at the same place, and the hoist is lifting the crate.
Once a crate has been loaded by a hoist onto a truck at a place, 
A crate can be unloaded by a hoist from a truck at a place only if the hoist is at the same place as the truck, the hoist is available, and the crate is in the truck.
Once a crate has been unloaded by a hoist from a truck at a place, the crate is not in the truck, the hoist is not available, and the hoist is lifting the crate.

[STATEMENT]
As initial conditions I have that, crate0 is at depot1, crate1 is at depot2, crate2 is at distributor0, hoist0 is at depot0, hoist1 is at depot1, hoist2 is at depot2, hoist3 is at distributor0, pallet0 is at depot0, pallet1 is at depot1, pallet2 is at depot2, pallet3 is at distributor0, truck0 is at distributor0, truck1 is at depot2, truck2 is at depot0, hoist0 is available, hoist1 is available, hoist2 is available, hoist3 is available, crate0 is clear, crate1 is clear, crate2 is clear, pallet0 is clear, crate0 is on pallet1, crate1 is on pallet2 and crate2 is on pallet3.
My goal is to have that crate0 is on pallet1, crate1 is on pallet2 and crate2 is on pallet0.

My plan is as follows:

NATURAL-PLAN sas_plan_1
------------------------------
This logistics plan outlines the necessary steps to achieve the required transportation goal, using the available trucks and hoists at various locations.

| Step | Time | Action | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 1 | 00:01 | **LIFT** | Use **hoist3** at **distributor0** to lift **crate2** from **pallet3**. |
| 2 | 00:02 | **LOAD** | Use **hoist3** at **distributor0** to load **crate2** into **truck0**. |
| 3 | 00:03 | **DRIVE** | **Truck0** drives from **distributor0** (Distributor) to **depot0** (Depot). |
| 4 | 00:04 | **UNLOAD** | Use **hoist0** at **depot0** to unload **crate2** from **truck0**. |
| 5 | 00:05 | **DROP** | Use **hoist0** at **depot0** to drop **crate2** onto **pallet0**. |

**Plan Goal Achieved:** Crate 2 is now successfully placed on Pallet 0 at Depot 0. The total execution cost is 5 units.
================================================================================


PROBLEM
------------------------------
I have to plan the logistics of transporting crates between a number of depots and distributors via trucks that are loaded by hoists. Depots and distributors are directly connected by roads (trucks can drive between any two depots or distributors).

A depot is a type of place.
A distributor is a type of place.
A pallet is a type of surface.
A crate is a type of surface.

Here are the actions that can be performed:

Drive a truck from one place to another place.
Use a hoist to lift a crate from a surface at a place.
Use a hoist to drop a crate to a surface at a place.
Use a hoist to load a crate into a truck at a place.
Use a hoist to unload a crate from a truck at a place.

The following are the restrictions on the actions:
A truck can be driven from one place to another place only if the truck is at the origin place.
Once a truck has been driven from one place to another, it is not at the origin place and is at the destination place.
A crate can be lifted by a hoist only if the hoist is at the same place as the crate, the hoist is available, and the crate is clear.
Once a crate has been lifted by a hoist from a surface at a place, the crate is not at the place, the hoist is lifting the crate, the hoist is not available, the surface is clear, and the crate is not on the surface.
A crate can be dropped by a hoist to a surface only if the hoist and surface are both at the place, the surface is clear, and the hoist is lifting the crate.
Once a crate has been dropped by a hoist to a surface at a place, the hoist is available, the hoist is not lifting the crate, the crate is at the place, the surface is not clear, the crate is clear, and the crate is on the surface.
A crate can be loaded by a hoist onto a truck at a place only if the hoist is at the same place, the truck is at the same place, and the hoist is lifting the crate.
Once a crate has been loaded by a hoist onto a truck at a place, 
A crate can be unloaded by a hoist from a truck at a place only if the hoist is at the same place as the truck, the hoist is available, and the crate is in the truck.
Once a crate has been unloaded by a hoist from a truck at a place, the crate is not in the truck, the hoist is not available, and the hoist is lifting the crate.

[STATEMENT]
As initial conditions I have that, crate0 is at depot1, crate1 is at depot1, crate2 is at depot0, hoist0 is at depot0, hoist1 is at depot1, hoist2 is at depot2, hoist3 is at distributor0, pallet0 is at depot0, pallet1 is at depot1, pallet2 is at depot2, pallet3 is at distributor0, truck0 is at depot2, truck1 is at distributor0, truck2 is at depot1, hoist0 is available, hoist1 is available, hoist2 is available, hoist3 is available, crate1 is clear, crate2 is clear, pallet2 is clear, pallet3 is clear, crate0 is on pallet1, crate1 is on crate0 and crate2 is on pallet0.
My goal is to have that crate0 is on pallet2, crate1 is on pallet0 and crate2 is on pallet1.

My plan is as follows:

Once a crate has been loaded by a hoist onto a truck at a place, 
A crate can be unloaded by a hoist from a truck at a place only if the hoist is at the same place as the truck, the hoist is available, and the crate is in the truck.
Once a crate has been unloaded by a hoist from a truck at a place, the crate is not in the truck, the hoist is not available, and the hoist is lifting the crate.
