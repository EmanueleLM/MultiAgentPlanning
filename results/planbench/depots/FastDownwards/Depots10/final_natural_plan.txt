Sequence of human-readable actions (matches the given plan exactly). Each step shows a timestamp (1.0 time unit per step), the action with its arguments, the formal preconditions (from the public model), whether they are satisfied at execution time, and the action effects (what it adds and deletes). The state is simulated incrementally so precondition checks are accurate.

Initial relevant facts (merged initial state highlights)
- hand: object_10, object_11, object_9
- cats: object_0, object_1
- texture: object_5, object_6, object_7, object_8, object_9
- sneeze: object_3, object_4, object_5
- spring: object_5, object_6, object_7, object_8
- stupendous: object_1, object_2, object_3
- collect: (6,2), (7,2), (8,3), (9,3), (5,1), (6,1), (8,2)
- next (initial): (0,8), (1,6), (10,6), (11,9), (4,6), (5,8), (0,5), (10,8), (11,6), (3,5), (4,7), (9,5)

Plan steps

1) Step 1 — time 0.0 → 1.0
Action: clip(object_10, object_4, object_6)
Preconditions (clip): hand(object_10), sneeze(object_4), texture(object_6), next(object_4,object_6), next(object_10,object_6)
Status: All preconditions satisfied (all true in the current state).
Effects:
- Adds: vase(object_10, object_4)
- Deletes: next(object_10, object_6)
State change summary: next(10,6) removed; vase(10,4) added.

Preconditions (tightfisted): hand(object_10), sneeze(object_4), texture(object_7), next(object_4,object_7), vase(object_10,object_4)
Status: All preconditions satisfied (vase(10,4) was added in Step 1 and next(4,7) exists initially).
Effects:
- Adds: next(object_10, object_7)
- Deletes: vase(object_10, object_4)

Status: All preconditions satisfied (vase(9,0) added in Step 3; next(0,7) added in Step 4).
Effects:
- Adds: next(object_9, object_7)
- Deletes: vase(object_9, object_0)
State change summary: next(9,7) added (this achieves goal next object_9 object_7); vase(9,0) removed.

6) Step 6 — time 5.0 → 6.0
Action: clip(object_11, object_4, object_6)
Preconditions (clip): hand(object_11), sneeze(object_4), texture(object_6), next(object_4,object_6), next(object_11,object_6)

Effects:
- Adds: vase(object_11, object_4)
- Deletes: next(object_11, object_6)
State change summary: next(11,6) removed; vase(11,4) added.

7) Step 7 — time 6.0 → 7.0
Action: tightfisted(object_11, object_4, object_7)
Preconditions (tightfisted): hand(object_11), sneeze(object_4), texture(object_7), next(object_4,object_7), vase(object_11,object_4)
Status: All preconditions satisfied (vase(11,4) added in Step 6; next(4,7) present initially).
Effects:
- Adds: next(object_11, object_7)
- Deletes: vase(object_11, object_4)
State change summary: next(11,7) added (this achieves goal next object_11 object_7); vase(11,4) removed.

8) Step 8 — time 7.0 → 8.0
Action: wretched(object_5, object_8, object_9, object_3)
Preconditions (wretched): sneeze(object_5), texture(object_8), texture(object_9), stupendous(object_3), next(object_5,object_8), collect(object_8,object_3), collect(object_9,object_3)
Status: All preconditions satisfied (next(5,8) and collect facts are in the initial state; sneeze/texture/stupendous facts present).
Effects:
- Adds: next(object_5, object_9)
- Deletes: next(object_5, object_8)
State change summary: next(5,9) added; next(5,8) removed.

Preconditions (clip): hand(object_11), sneeze(object_5), texture(object_9), next(object_5,object_9), next(object_11,object_9)
Status: All preconditions satisfied (next(5,9) was just added in Step 8; next(11,9) was present initially and not deleted until now).
Effects:
- Adds: vase(object_11, object_5)
- Deletes: next(object_11, object_9)
State change summary: vase(11,5) added; next(11,9) removed.

10) Step 10 — time 9.0 → 10.0

Status: All preconditions satisfied (next(5,9) still present; collect facts present).
Effects:
- Adds: next(object_5, object_8)
- Deletes: next(object_5, object_9)
State change summary: next(5,8) restored; next(5,9) removed.

11) Step 11 — time 10.0 → 11.0

Preconditions (tightfisted): hand(object_11), sneeze(object_5), texture(object_8), next(object_5,object_8), vase(object_11,object_5)
Status: All preconditions satisfied (next(5,8) re-added in Step 10; vase(11,5) was added in Step 9).
Effects:
- Adds: next(object_11, object_8)
- Deletes: vase(object_11, object_5)
State change summary: next(11,8) added (this achieves goal next object_11 object_8); vase(11,5) removed.

Final verification (after Step 11)
- next(object_10, object_7): added in Step 2 — present
- next(object_11, object_8): added in Step 11 — present
- next(object_11, object_7): added in Step 7 — present
- next(object_9, object_7): added in Step 5 — present

All four goal facts are true in the final state. Every action in the provided plan was executed in order; at each step the public-model preconditions were satisfied by the state at that time, and the effects were applied as described above.

Notes
- Each step used 1.0 time unit in this presentation; timestamps are shown as start → end for readability (you can rescale durations if you prefer different timing).
- No steps were added or removed; the sequence matches the provided plan exactly.
