Below is a human-readable, step-by-step execution of the provided PDDL plan. Each step lists: a timestamp (start time), an estimated duration (1.0 time unit each), the grounded action with a short plain-language description, the grounded preconditions (and whether they are satisfied at that moment), and the grounded effects applied.

Summary assumption: each action executes sequentially, each taking 1.0 time unit. Time t = 0.0 is the start of step 1.

Final state (after t=15.0)
The goal predicates are achieved:

- (next object_11 object_7) — added at step 14
- (next object_12 object_7) — added at step 13

No step required facts that were missing; every action’s preconditions were satisfied at the time of execution (either from the initial state or as effects of earlier steps). The plan completes at t = 15.0 and meets the requested goal.
