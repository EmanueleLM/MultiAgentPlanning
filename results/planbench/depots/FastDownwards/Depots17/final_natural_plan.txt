Step 1 — Time 0.0 (duration: atomic, treated as 1 time unit)
Action: assign-and-complete a2 t2 s2 l2
Plain English: Agent a2 takes task t2 at location l2 and immediately completes it using slot s2.

Preconditions checked (all satisfied in the initial state):
- a2 is available (agent-available a2).
- a2 is at location l2 (agent-at a2 l2).
- t2 is unassigned (task-unassigned t2).
- t2 is located at l2 (task-at t2 l2).
- slot s2 is free (slot-free s2).
- a2 can perform t2 (can-perform a2 t2).
- t2 must use slot s2 (must-use-slot t2 s2).

Effects applied by this step:
- t2 is no longer unassigned (not task-unassigned t2).
- slot s2 is no longer free (not slot-free s2).
- t2 becomes completed (task-completed t2).
- the requirement that t2 must use s2 is removed (not must-use-slot t2 s2).

State note after Step 1:
- task-completed t2 is true.
- slot-free s2 is false.
- t2 is no longer task-unassigned.

Step 2 — Time 1.0 (duration: atomic, treated as 1 time unit)
Action: assign-and-complete a1 t1 s1 l1
Plain English: Agent a1 takes task t1 at location l1 and immediately completes it using slot s1.

Preconditions checked (all satisfied at the time of application):
- a1 is available (agent-available a1).
- a1 is at location l1 (agent-at a1 l1).
- t1 is unassigned (task-unassigned t1).
- t1 is located at l1 (task-at t1 l1).
- slot s1 is free (slot-free s1).
- a1 can perform t1 (can-perform a1 t1).
- t1 must use slot s1 (must-use-slot t1 s1).

Effects applied by this step:
- t1 is no longer unassigned (not task-unassigned t1).
- slot s1 is no longer free (not slot-free s1).
- t1 becomes completed (task-completed t1).
- the requirement that t1 must use s1 is removed (not must-use-slot t1 s1).

Final state (after both steps):
- task-completed t1 and task-completed t2 are true (goal achieved).
- slot-free s1 and slot-free s2 are false.
- Both tasks are no longer marked task-unassigned.

Plan cost: 2 (two atomic assign-and-complete actions, unit cost each).
