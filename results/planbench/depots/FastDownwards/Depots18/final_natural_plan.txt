Plan (human-readable, step-by-step). Each step lists a timestamp, the action and its three/four parameters, the required preconditions checked against the current state, and the immediate effects on the relevant relations (next / vase). All ten plan steps are given in the order from the provided plan and no actions were added or removed.

Initial relevant facts (from the problem) used below (only predicates referenced by the plan):
- hand: object_10, object_11, object_12, object_13
- sneeze: object_3, object_4, object_5
- texture: object_5, object_6, object_7, object_8, object_9, object_10
- spring: object_5, object_6, object_8
- stupendous: object_1, object_2, object_3
- collect: (object_6,object_2), (object_7,object_2), (object_8,object_3), (object_9,object_3), (object_10,object_2), (object_5,object_1), (object_6,object_1), (object_7,object_1), (object_8,object_2), (object_9,object_2)
- initial next relations used: (object_0,8), (object_1,8), (object_10,7), (object_11,9), (object_12,8), (object_13,9), (object_4,7), (object_5,9), (object_11,6), (object_3,7), (object_4,8)
- initial vase relations: none relevant initially

Step 1 — t = 0.0s
Action: clip object_10 object_4 object_7
- Meaning: use hand object_10 with sneeze object_4 and texture object_7 to clip, requiring next(object_4,object_7) and next(object_10,object_7).
- Preconditions checked (all present): hand(object_10); sneeze(object_4); texture(object_7); next(object_4,object_7); next(object_10,object_7).
- Effects: add vase(object_10,object_4); delete next(object_10,object_7).
- Net change (relevant): +vase(10,4); −next(10,7).

Step 2 — t = 1.0s
Action: clip object_12 object_4 object_8
- Preconditions checked (all present): hand(object_12); sneeze(object_4); texture(object_8); next(object_4,object_8); next(object_12,object_8).
- Effects: add vase(object_12,object_4); delete next(object_12,object_8).
- Net change: +vase(12,4); −next(12,8).

Step 3 — t = 2.0s
Action: tightfisted object_12 object_4 object_7
- Meaning: convert vase(12,4) into next(12,7) given next(4,7).
- Preconditions checked (all present): hand(object_12); sneeze(object_4); texture(object_7); next(object_4,object_7); vase(object_12,object_4) (created in Step 2).
- Effects: add next(object_12,object_7); delete vase(object_12,object_4).
- Net change: +next(12,7); −vase(12,4).

Step 4 — t = 3.0s
Action: wretched object_4 object_7 object_6 object_1
- Meaning: change next(4,7) to next(4,6) because collect(7,1) and collect(6,1) and stupendous(1).
- Preconditions checked (all present): sneeze(object_4); texture(object_7); texture(object_6); stupendous(object_1); next(object_4,object_7); collect(object_7,object_1); collect(object_6,object_1).
- Effects: add next(object_4,object_6); delete next(object_4,object_7).
- Net change: +next(4,6); −next(4,7).

Step 5 — t = 4.0s
Action: clip object_11 object_4 object_6
- Preconditions checked (all present): hand(object_11); sneeze(object_4); texture(object_6); next(object_4,object_6) (created in Step 4); next(object_11,object_6) (initial).
- Effects: add vase(object_11,object_4); delete next(object_11,object_6).
- Net change: +vase(11,4); −next(11,6).

Step 6 — t = 5.0s
Action: tightfisted object_10 object_4 object_6
- Preconditions checked (all present): hand(object_10); sneeze(object_4); texture(object_6); next(object_4,object_6) (from Step 4); vase(object_10,object_4) (from Step 1).
- Effects: add next(object_10,object_6); delete vase(object_10,object_4).
- Net change: +next(10,6); −vase(10,4).
- Note: This achieves the goal next object_10 object_6.

Step 7 — t = 6.0s
Action: clip object_11 object_5 object_9
- Preconditions checked (all present): hand(object_11); sneeze(object_5); texture(object_9); next(object_5,object_9) (initial); next(object_11,object_9) (initial).
- Effects: add vase(object_11,object_5); delete next(object_11,object_9).
- Net change: +vase(11,5); −next(11,9).

Step 8 — t = 7.0s
Action: wretched object_5 object_9 object_10 object_2
- Preconditions checked (all present): sneeze(object_5); texture(object_9); texture(object_10); stupendous(object_2); next(object_5,object_9) (initial); collect(object_9,object_2); collect(object_10,object_2).
- Effects: add next(object_5,object_10); delete next(object_5,object_9).
- Net change: +next(5,10); −next(5,9).

Step 9 — t = 8.0s
Action: tightfisted object_11 object_5 object_10
- Preconditions checked (all present): hand(object_11); sneeze(object_5); texture(object_10); next(object_5,object_10) (created in Step 8); vase(object_11,object_5) (created in Step 7).
- Effects: add next(object_11,object_10); delete vase(object_11,object_5).
- Net change: +next(11,10); −vase(11,5).
- Note: This achieves the observer's requested relation next object_11 object_10.

Step 10 — t = 9.0s
Action: tightfisted object_11 object_4 object_8
- Preconditions checked (all present): hand(object_11); sneeze(object_4); texture(object_8); next(object_4,object_8) (initial); vase(object_11,object_4) (created in Step 5 and still present).
- Effects: add next(object_11,object_8); delete vase(object_11,object_4).
- Net change: +next(11,8); −vase(11,4).
- Note: This achieves the goal next object_11 object_8.

Final relevant next relations (after all steps) that satisfy the problem goals:
- next(object_10,object_6) — created Step 6
- next(object_11,object_8) — created Step 10
- next(object_12,object_7) — created Step 3
- next(object_13,object_9) — present initially and never deleted
- next(object_11,object_10) — created Step 9

All required goals in the problem are satisfied by the sequence above:
- (next object_10 object_6) ✓
- (next object_11 object_8) ✓
- (next object_12 object_7) ✓
- (next object_13 object_9) ✓
- (next object_11 object_10) ✓
