Here is the human-readable execution of the plan that achieves the goal next object_11 object_9:

- Step 1 (t=0): wretched object_4 object_10 object_8 object_2
  Description: Using sneeze object_4, textures object_10 and object_8, stupendous object_2, and the collects with object_2, redirect object_4’s successor from object_10 to object_8.

- Step 2 (t=1): clip object_11 object_4 object_8
  Description: With hand object_11, sneeze object_4, texture object_8, and both next object_4 object_8 and next object_11 object_8, establish a vase link between object_11 and object_4.
  Effect: Adds vase object_11 object_4; deletes next object_11 object_8.

- Step 3 (t=2): wretched object_4 object_8 object_9 object_2
  Description: Using sneeze object_4, textures object_8 and object_9, stupendous object_2, and the collects with object_2, redirect object_4’s successor from object_8 to object_9.
  Effect: Adds next object_4 object_9; deletes next object_4 object_8.

- Step 4 (t=3): tightfisted object_11 object_4 object_9
  Description: With hand object_11, sneeze object_4, texture object_9, next object_4 object_9, and vase object_11 object_4, advance object_11’s successor to object_9.
  Effect: Adds next object_11 object_9; deletes vase object_11 object_4.

Goal achieved: next object_11 object_9.
