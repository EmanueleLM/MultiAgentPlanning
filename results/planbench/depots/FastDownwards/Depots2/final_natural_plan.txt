Here is the human-readable execution of the given plan (timestamps in steps; assume each action takes 1 unit time):

1) t=0, duration=1
   Action: (memory object_0 object_6 object_5)
   Preconditions used: cats object_0; spring object_6; spring object_5; next object_0 object_6
   Effects: add next object_0 object_5; delete next object_0 object_6

2) t=1, duration=1
   Action: (sip object_8 object_0 object_5)
   Preconditions used: hand object_8; cats object_0; texture object_5; next object_8 object_5; next object_0 object_5
   Effects: add vase object_8 object_0; delete next object_8 object_5

3) t=2, duration=1
   Action: (memory object_0 object_5 object_6)
   Preconditions used: cats object_0; spring object_5; spring object_6; next object_0 object_5
   Effects: add next object_0 object_6; delete next object_0 object_5

4) t=3, duration=1
   Action: (paltry object_8 object_0 object_6)
   Preconditions used: hand object_8; cats object_0; texture object_6; vase object_8 object_0; next object_0 object_6
   Effects: add next object_8 object_6; delete vase object_8 object_0

Final state satisfies the goal: next object_7 object_6 (already true initially) and next object_8 object_6 (achieved at step 4).
