FINAL-PLAN
------------------------------
Report (integration and assumptions)
- I am the orchestrator integrating agent_1 and agent_2 analyses, reconciling differences, and producing PDDL artifacts.
- Assumptions (explicit):
  1. Action schemas are implemented exactly as in the shared public information; no additional Preconditions or Effects exist.
  2. No predicates other than those listed (hand, cats, texture, vase, next, collect, sneeze, spring, stupendous) are present.
  3. The initial facts are exactly as provided for each statement; there are no implicit or extra vase facts.
  4. All objects not listed in a statement are absent from that problem's initial state.
  5. We operate in classical STRIPS: deletes are represented via negative effects (not ...). No temporal/durative modeling required.
- I produce two problem files (Statement A and Statement B) and a single shared domain. Below are the reconciled agent reports and plan validation details.

Report_agent_1 (analysis of Statement A and provided plan)
1) Grounded objects (Statement A)
- Objects present in initial facts: object_0, object_1, object_2, object_3, object_4, object_5, object_6, object_7, object_8, object_9, object_10, object_11.

2) Applicable actions in the initial state (Statement A)
- Evaluate all available actions with initial facts. Initially applicable (grounded) actions:
  - wretched object_4 object_10 object_8 object_2
    - Rationale: sneeze object_4, texture object_10, texture object_8, stupendous object_2; next object_4 object_10 exists; collect object_10 object_2 and collect object_8 object_2 both hold.
  - memory object_0 object_5 object_8
    - Rationale: cats object_0, spring object_5, spring object_8, next object_0 object_5 exists.
- Not applicable initially:
  - paltry: requires vase ?o0 ?o1 — no vase facts present.
  - sip: requires both next ?o0 ?o2 and next ?o1 ?o2 with cats ?o1 — cats only object_0 but next object_0 does not pair with the required texture; fails.
  - clip: requires both next ?o1 ?o2 and next ?o0 ?o2 with hand ?o0 — the required second next facts don't align initially.
  - tightfisted: requires vase ?o0 ?o1 — no vase present initially.

3) Step-by-step validation of the provided plan for Statement A
Provided plan:
  Step 1: wretched object_4 object_10 object_8 object_2
  Step 2: clip object_11 object_4 object_8
  Step 3: wretched object_4 object_8 object_9 object_2
  Step 4: tightfisted object_11 object_4 object_9

Initial next facts: next(0,5), next(11,8), next(3,5), next(4,10)

Step 1: wretched o4 o10 o8 o2
- Preconditions check:
  - sneeze o4? yes.
  - texture o10? yes.
  - texture o8? yes.
  - stupendous o2? yes.
  - next o4 o10? yes.
  - collect o10 o2? yes.
  - collect o8 o2? yes.
- Effects:
  - Add next o4 o8.
  - Delete next o4 o10.
- Resulting changes:
  - next(4,10) removed, next(4,8) added.
- Step valid: YES.

Step 2: clip o11 o4 o8
- Preconditions check:
  - hand o11? yes.
  - sneeze o4? yes.
  - texture o8? yes.
  - next o4 o8? yes (added by step 1).
  - next o11 o8? yes (present initially).
- Effects:
  - Add vase o11 o4.
  - Delete next o11 o8.
- Resulting changes:
  - next(11,8) removed.
  - vase(11,4) added.
- Step valid: YES.

Step 3: wretched o4 o8 o9 o2
- Preconditions check:
  - sneeze o4? yes.
  - texture o8? yes.
  - texture o9? yes.
  - stupendous o2? yes.
  - next o4 o8? yes (was added in step 1 and not deleted until step 3).
  - collect o8 o2? yes.
  - collect o9 o2? yes.
- Effects:
  - Add next o4 o9.
  - Delete next o4 o8.
- Resulting changes:
  - next(4,8) removed.
  - next(4,9) added.
- Step valid: YES.

Step 4: tightfisted o11 o4 o9
- Preconditions check:
  - hand o11? yes.
  - sneeze o4? yes.
  - texture o9? yes.
  - next o4 o9? yes (added by step 3).
  - vase o11 o4? yes (added by step 2).
- Effects:
  - Add next o11 o9.
  - Delete vase o11 o4.
- Resulting changes:
  - Next(11,9) added — this is the goal.
  - vase(11,4) removed.
- Step valid: YES.

4) Conclusion about achievability (Statement A)
- The provided plan is valid: each action's preconditions are satisfied at the time of execution; effects correctly update the state; the final goal next object_11 object_9 is achieved after step 4.
- There are no missing initial facts required by the plan: all required preconditions are either present initially or are produced by earlier plan steps.

5) Minimal notes/suggestions (Statement A)
- Alternate paths: memory object_0 object_5 object_8 was also initially applicable and would change next(0,5) to next(0,8); it is not needed for the provided plan.
- No corrections required to the plan — it is consistent and executable under the given schemas.

Report_agent_2 (analysis and candidate plan for Statement B)
1) Grounded objects (Statement B)
- Objects present: object_0, object_1, object_2, object_3, object_4, object_5, object_6, object_7, object_8, object_9, object_10, object_11, object_12.

2) Applicable actions in the initial state (Statement B)
- Evaluate action applicability given initial facts in Statement B.
- Immediately applicable ground actions (non-exhaustive list of useful ones):
  - memory object_0 object_6 object_9
    - cats object_0, spring object_6 and object_9, next object_0 object_6 -> adds next(0,9) and removes next(0,6).
  - wretched object_5 object_9 object_10 object_3
    - sneeze object_5, texture object_9 and object_10 present, stupendous object_3, next object_5 object_9, collect object_9 object_3 and collect object_10 object_3 hold -> adds next(5,10) and removes next(5,9).
  - wretched object_5 object_9 object_11 object_3
    - similarly: next(5,11) can be created because collect(9,3) and collect(11,3) exist (common collect target object_3).
  - wretched object_4 object_7 object_6 object_2
    - sneeze o4, texture o7 and o6, stupendous o2, next(4,7), collect(7,2), collect(6,2) -> creates next(4,6).
- Not applicable initially:
  - paltry, tightfisted require a vase ?o0 ?o1 — no vase facts initially.
  - sip and clip can create a vase, but clip requires both next ?o1 ?o2 and next ?o0 ?o2. For clip to create vase(12,?) we need next(12,?x) and next(sneeze,?x); we have next(12,10) initially, so if we can produce next(sneeze-someone,10) we can clip(12, sneeze, 10) to get vase(12, sneeze). That is reachable (see candidate plan below).

3) Candidate plan to reach goal next object_12 object_11 (Statement B)
- I found a short feasible plan using available actions that creates a vase between hand object_12 and sneeze object_5, then uses tightfisted to produce next(12,11). The plan is:

  Step 1: wretched object_5 object_9 object_10 object_3
    - Preconditions:
      - sneeze object_5, texture object_9 and object_10, stupendous object_3, next object_5 object_9, collect object_9 object_3, collect object_10 object_3.
    - Effects:
      - Add next object_5 object_10.
      - Delete next object_5 object_9.

  Step 2: clip object_12 object_5 object_10
    - Preconditions:
      - hand object_12, sneeze object_5, texture object_10, next object_5 object_10 (created by step 1), next object_12 object_10 (present initially).
    - Effects:
      - Add vase object_12 object_5.
      - Delete next object_12 object_10.

  Step 3: wretched object_5 object_10 object_11 object_3
    - Preconditions:
      - sneeze object_5, texture object_10 and object_11, stupendous object_3, next object_5 object_10 (created by step 1 and used then changed by step 3), collect object_10 object_3, collect object_11 object_3.
    - Effects:
      - Add next object_5 object_11.
      - Delete next object_5 object_10.

  Step 4: tightfisted object_12 object_5 object_11
    - Preconditions:
      - hand object_12, sneeze object_5, texture object_11, next object_5 object_11 (created in step 3), vase object_12 object_5 (created in step 2).
    - Effects:
      - Add next object_12 object_11 (goal achieved).
      - Delete vase object_12 object_5.

- Validation:
  - Each precondition for the steps is present at the time of execution (step 1 uses only initial facts; step 2 uses result of step 1 and the initial next(12,10); step 3 uses the result of step 1; step 4 uses results of steps 2 and 3). No step requires facts that are missing or removed prematurely.
  - The plan yields next(object_12,object_11) after step 4.

4) Conclusion and suggestions (Statement B)
- The goal next object_12 object_11 is reachable with the actions and initial facts provided. The candidate 4-step plan above is feasible and respects the action schemas.
- Minimal additional facts to reach the goal are NOT required, because the candidate plan uses only facts that are initially present or generated by earlier steps.
- If alternative shorter plans are desired, one could explore other sneeze objects (like object_4) if a route to align next relations with next object_12 ?x exists, but the plan above is straightforward and valid.

PDDL domain and problems
- Below I provide a single domain and two problem files (one per statement). The domain encodes the action schemas given in the shared public information, in STRIPS-compatible PDDL. The two problems encode the exact initial facts and goals as provided.
