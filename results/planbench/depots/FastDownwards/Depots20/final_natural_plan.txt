Here is the human-readable execution of the given plan. Each step is instantaneous with an assumed duration of 1 time unit.

- Step 1 (t=0, duration=1): wretched(object_4, object_10, object_8, object_2)
  - Effect: Replace next(object_4, object_10) with next(object_4, object_8).

- Step 2 (t=1, duration=1): clip(object_11, object_4, object_8)
  - Effect: Add vase(object_11, object_4); remove next(object_11, object_8).

- Step 3 (t=2, duration=1): wretched(object_4, object_8, object_9, object_2)
  - Effect: Replace next(object_4, object_8) with next(object_4, object_9).

- Step 4 (t=3, duration=1): tightfisted(object_11, object_4, object_9)
  - Effect: Add next(object_11, object_9); remove vase(object_11, object_4).

Result: Goal achieved — next(object_11, object_9).
