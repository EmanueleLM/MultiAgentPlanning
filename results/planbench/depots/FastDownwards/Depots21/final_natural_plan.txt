Here is the human-readable sequence that follows the given plan exactly. Each action starts at the indicated time and has duration 1 (unit cost).

- t=0 to t=1: (wretched object_5 object_9 object_10 object_2) — Redirect object_5’s next-link from object_9 to object_10 using the wretched operation.
- t=1 to t=2: (clip object_12 object_5 object_10) — Using texture at object_10, bind object_12 to object_5 (create vase(object_12, object_5)).
- t=2 to t=3: (wretched object_5 object_10 object_11 object_3) — Redirect object_5’s next-link from object_10 to object_11.
- t=3 to t=4: (tightfisted object_12 object_5 object_11) — From the vase link, advance object_12 to next object_11 and remove the vase link (achieves next object_12 object_11).
- t=4 to t=5: (wretched object_4 object_7 object_9 object_2) — Redirect object_4’s next-link from object_7 to object_9.
- t=5 to t=6: (clip object_11 object_4 object_9) — Using texture at object_9, bind object_11 to object_4 (create vase(object_11, object_4)).
- t=6 to t=7: (wretched object_4 object_9 object_7 object_2) — Redirect object_4’s next-link from object_9 back to object_7.
- t=7 to t=8: (tightfisted object_11 object_4 object_7) — From the vase link, advance object_11 to next object_7 and remove the vase link (achieves next object_11 object_7).

Final goals satisfied:
- next object_12 object_11
- next object_11 object_7
