Here is the human-readable sequence of actions that follows the given plan exactly and achieves the goal:

1) [t=0, duration=1] clip(object_12, object_4, object_10)
   - Use the hand-held object_12 with the sneezing object_4 at textured object_10 where both are at object_10; establish vase(object_12, object_4) and remove next(object_12, object_10).

2) [t=1, duration=1] wretched(object_4, object_10, object_8, object_2)
   - Reroute object_4 from next(object_4, object_10) to next(object_4, object_8) using stupendous object_2 and the required collections; add next(object_4, object_8) and delete next(object_4, object_10).

3) [t=2, duration=1] tightfisted(object_12, object_4, object_8)
   - Using vase(object_12, object_4) and next(object_4, object_8), place object_12 next to object_8; add next(object_12, object_8) and remove vase(object_12, object_4).

4) [t=3, duration=1] wretched(object_3, object_7, object_6, object_1)
   - Shift object_3 from next(object_3, object_7) to next(object_3, object_6) using stupendous object_1 and the required collections; add next(object_3, object_6) and delete next(object_3, object_7).

5) [t=4, duration=1] clip(object_11, object_3, object_6)
   - Bind hand-held object_11 with sneezing object_3 at textured object_6 where both are at object_6; establish vase(object_11, object_3) and remove next(object_11, object_6).

6) [t=5, duration=1] wretched(object_3, object_6, object_7, object_1)
   - Reroute object_3 from next(object_3, object_6) back to next(object_3, object_7); add next(object_3, object_7) and delete next(object_3, object_6).

7) [t=6, duration=1] tightfisted(object_11, object_3, object_7)
   - Using vase(object_11, object_3) and next(object_3, object_7), place object_11 next to object_7; add next(object_11, object_7) and remove vase(object_11, object_3).

Result: Goal satisfied with next(object_12, object_8) from step 3 and next(object_11, object_7) from step 7.
