Human-readable execution plan for depots23-s1 (7 steps, unit duration each)

1) t=0 to t=1 (duration 1)
   Action: clip object_12 object_4 object_10
   Effect: establish vase(object_12, object_4); remove next(object_12, object_10).

2) t=1 to t=2 (duration 1)
   Action: wretched object_4 object_10 object_8 object_2
   Effect: switch next to next(object_4, object_8); remove next(object_4, object_10).

3) t=2 to t=3 (duration 1)
   Action: tightfisted object_12 object_4 object_8
   Effect: set next(object_12, object_8); remove vase(object_12, object_4).
   Note: This achieves goal component next(object_12, object_8).

4) t=3 to t=4 (duration 1)
   Action: wretched object_3 object_7 object_6 object_1
   Effect: switch next to next(object_3, object_6); remove next(object_3, object_7).

5) t=4 to t=5 (duration 1)
   Action: clip object_11 object_3 object_6
   Effect: establish vase(object_11, object_3); remove next(object_11, object_6).

6) t=5 to t=6 (duration 1)
   Action: wretched object_3 object_6 object_7 object_1
   Effect: switch next to next(object_3, object_7); remove next(object_3, object_6).

7) t=6 to t=7 (duration 1)
   Action: tightfisted object_11 object_3 object_7
   Effect: set next(object_11, object_7); remove vase(object_11, object_3).
   Note: This achieves goal component next(object_11, object_7).

Final outcome: Both goal facts are satisfied — next(object_12, object_8) and next(object_11, object_7).
