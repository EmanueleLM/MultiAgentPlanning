Plan (human-readable sequence, actions executed by player1 — timestamps assume 1 time unit per action):

1) Time 0.0 → 1.0 — Action: player1 performs p1-clip(object_11, object_8)
   - Preconditions checked: hand(object_11) — satisfied (present in initial facts).
   - Effect produced: next(object_11, object_8) is added to the state.
   - Notes: This establishes the relation next object_11 → object_8 required by player2's goal.

2) Time 1.0 → 2.0 — Action: player1 performs p1-clip(object_12, object_10)
   - Preconditions checked: hand(object_12) — satisfied (present in initial facts).
   - Effect produced: next(object_12, object_10) is added to the state.
   - Notes: This directly achieves player1's goal next object_12 → object_10.

3) Time 2.0 → 3.0 — Action: player1 performs p1-clip(object_12, object_8)
   - Preconditions checked: hand(object_12) — still satisfied.
   - Effect produced: next(object_12, object_8) is added to the state.
   - Notes: This contributes to player2's requirement next object_12 → object_8.

4) Time 3.0 → 4.0 — Action: player1 performs p1-clip(object_13, object_10)
   - Preconditions checked: hand(object_13) — satisfied (present in initial facts).
   - Effect produced: next(object_13, object_10) is added to the state.
   - Notes: This, together with the already-present or newly-added facts, supports the combined goal next object_13 → object_9 and next object_13 → object_10 (next object_13 object_9 was already in the initial state).

Final outcome after these 4 actions:
- Newly added facts: next(object_11, object_8), next(object_12, object_10), next(object_12, object_8), next(object_13, object_10).
- The combined goal predicates listed in the problem are satisfied:
  - next object_12 object_10 — achieved at step 2
  - next object_13 object_9 — already present in initial state
  - next object_11 object_8 — achieved at step 1
  - next object_12 object_8 — achieved at step 3
  - next object_13 object_10 — achieved at step 4

Total plan cost: 4 (unit cost per action).
