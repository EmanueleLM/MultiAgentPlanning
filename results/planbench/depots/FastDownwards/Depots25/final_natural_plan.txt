Plan execution (15 steps). Each step listed with a timestamp assuming unit duration per action (start time in seconds, duration = 1.0s). For each step I give the action (as in the plan), the objects, a brief note that the action's preconditions are satisfied at that time, and the direct effects on the relevant predicates (mainly next(...) and vase(...)).

Step 1 — t=0.0s (duration 1.0s)
Action: clip object_11 object_4 object_10
Preconditions satisfied: hand(object_11), sneeze(object_4), texture(object_10), next(object_4,object_10), next(object_11,object_10)
Effects: add vase(object_11,object_4); delete next(object_11,object_10)

Step 2 — t=1.0s (duration 1.0s)
Action: wretched object_3 object_7 object_6 object_1
Preconditions satisfied: sneeze(object_3), texture(object_7), texture(object_6), stupendous(object_1), next(object_3,object_7), collect(object_7,object_1), collect(object_6,object_1)
Effects: add next(object_3,object_6); delete next(object_3,object_7)

Step 3 — t=2.0s (duration 1.0s)
Action: clip object_12 object_3 object_6
Preconditions satisfied: hand(object_12), sneeze(object_3), texture(object_6), next(object_3,object_6), next(object_12,object_6)
Effects: add vase(object_12,object_3); delete next(object_12,object_6)

Step 4 — t=3.0s (duration 1.0s)
Action: wretched object_3 object_6 object_5 object_1
Preconditions satisfied: sneeze(object_3), texture(object_6), texture(object_5), stupendous(object_1), next(object_3,object_6), collect(object_6,object_1), collect(object_5,object_1)
Effects: add next(object_3,object_5); delete next(object_3,object_6)

Step 5 — t=4.0s (duration 1.0s)
Action: tightfisted object_12 object_3 object_5
Preconditions satisfied: hand(object_12), sneeze(object_3), texture(object_5), next(object_3,object_5), vase(object_12,object_3)
Effects: add next(object_12,object_5); delete vase(object_12,object_3)

Step 6 — t=5.0s (duration 1.0s)
Action: wretched object_4 object_10 object_8 object_2
Preconditions satisfied: sneeze(object_4), texture(object_10), texture(object_8), stupendous(object_2), next(object_4,object_10), collect(object_10,object_2), collect(object_8,object_2)
Effects: add next(object_4,object_8); delete next(object_4,object_10)

Step 7 — t=6.0s (duration 1.0s)
Action: tightfisted object_11 object_4 object_8
Preconditions satisfied: hand(object_11), sneeze(object_4), texture(object_8), next(object_4,object_8), vase(object_11,object_4)
Effects: add next(object_11,object_8); delete vase(object_11,object_4)

Step 8 — t=7.0s (duration 1.0s)
Action: wretched object_4 object_8 object_9 object_2
Preconditions satisfied: sneeze(object_4), texture(object_8), texture(object_9), stupendous(object_2), next(object_4,object_8), collect(object_8,object_2), collect(object_9,object_2)
Effects: add next(object_4,object_9); delete next(object_4,object_8)

Step 9 — t=8.0s (duration 1.0s)
Action: clip object_13 object_4 object_9
Preconditions satisfied: hand(object_13), sneeze(object_4), texture(object_9), next(object_4,object_9), next(object_13,object_9)
Effects: add vase(object_13,object_4); delete next(object_13,object_9)

Step 10 — t=9.0s (duration 1.0s)
Action: wretched object_4 object_9 object_10 object_2
Preconditions satisfied: sneeze(object_4), texture(object_9), texture(object_10), stupendous(object_2), next(object_4,object_9), collect(object_9,object_2), collect(object_10,object_2)
Effects: add next(object_4,object_10); delete next(object_4,object_9)

Step 11 — t=10.0s (duration 1.0s)
Action: tightfisted object_13 object_4 object_10
Preconditions satisfied: hand(object_13), sneeze(object_4), texture(object_10), next(object_4,object_10), vase(object_13,object_4)
Effects: add next(object_13,object_10); delete vase(object_13,object_4)

Step 12 — t=11.0s (duration 1.0s)
Action: memory object_0 object_8 object_5
Preconditions satisfied: cats(object_0), spring(object_8), spring(object_5), next(object_0,object_8)
Effects: add next(object_0,object_5); delete next(object_0,object_8)

Step 13 — t=12.0s (duration 1.0s)
Action: sip object_12 object_0 object_5
Preconditions satisfied: hand(object_12), cats(object_0), texture(object_5), next(object_12,object_5), next(object_0,object_5)
Effects: add vase(object_12,object_0); delete next(object_12,object_5)

Step 14 — t=13.0s (duration 1.0s)
Action: memory object_0 object_5 object_8
Preconditions satisfied: cats(object_0), spring(object_5), spring(object_8), next(object_0,object_5)
Effects: add next(object_0,object_8); delete next(object_0,object_5)

Step 15 — t=14.0s (duration 1.0s)
Action: paltry object_12 object_0 object_8
Preconditions satisfied: hand(object_12), cats(object_0), texture(object_8), vase(object_12,object_0), next(object_0,object_8)
Effects: add next(object_12,object_8); delete vase(object_12,object_0)

Final state with respect to the goal:
- next(object_11,object_8) — established at Step 7
- next(object_12,object_8) — established at Step 15
- next(object_13,object_10) — established at Step 11

Verdict: The given sequence of 15 actions (executed in the order above) is internally consistent with the domain preconditions/effects and achieves the stated goal (all three required next(...) relations are true at the end).
