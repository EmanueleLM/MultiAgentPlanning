NATURAL-PLAN sas_plan_1
------------------------------
Here is the human-readable execution of the provided plan, with timestamps and durations. The action names and arguments match the plan exactly.

- Step 1 (t=0.0 → 1.0, duration 1): sip(object_8, object_1, object_7)
  Effect: Creates vase(object_8, object_1) and removes next(object_8, object_7).

- Step 2 (t=1.0 → 2.0, duration 1): memory(object_1, object_7, object_6)
  Effect: Switches the link from next(object_1, object_7) to next(object_1, object_6).

- Step 3 (t=2.0 → 3.0, duration 1): paltry(object_8, object_1, object_6)
  Effect: Establishes next(object_8, object_6) and removes vase(object_8, object_1).

Outcome: Goal achieved — next(object_8, object_6) is true at t=3.0.

NATURAL-PLAN sas_plan_10
------------------------------
Here is the human-readable execution of the provided plan, with 1 time unit per action.

1) t=0–1: Perform sip object_8 object_1 object_7
   - Intuition: While holding object_8 and with cat object_1 at textured place object_7 where both are “next” to object_7, link object_8 to object_1 (as a vase relation), and give up object_8’s adjacency to object_7.
   - Resulting changes: add vase(object_8, object_1); delete next(object_8, object_7).

2) t=1–2: Perform memory object_1 object_7 object_6
   - Intuition: Move cat object_1’s adjacency from springy place object_7 to springy place object_6.
   - Resulting changes: add next(object_1, object_6); delete next(object_1, object_7).

3) t=2–3: Perform paltry object_8 object_1 object_6
   - Intuition: Using the vase link between object_8 and cat object_1, and with textured place object_6 where object_1 is now adjacent, move object_8 to be adjacent to object_6 and drop the vase link.
   - Resulting changes: add next(object_8, object_6); delete vase(object_8, object_1).

Outcome: Goal achieved at t=3 — next(object_8, object_6) is true. Total duration: 3 time units.

Once paltry is performed the following facts will be true: next object_0 object_2
Once paltry is performed the following facts will be false: vase object_0 object_1
To perform sip action, the following facts need to be true: hand object_0, cats object_1, texture object_2, next object_0 object_2, and next object_1 object_2
Once sip is performed the following facts will be true: vase object_0 object_1
Once sip is performed the following facts will be false: next object_0 object_2
To perform clip action, the following facts need to be true: hand object_0, sneeze object_1, texture object_2, next object_1 object_2, and next object_0 object_2
Once clip is performed the following facts will be true: vase object_0 object_1
Once clip is performed the following facts will be false: next object_0 object_2
To perform wretched action, the following facts need to be true: sneeze object_0, texture object_1, texture object_2, stupendous object_3, next object_0 object_1, collect object_1 object_3, and collect object_2 object_3
Once wretched is performed the following facts will be true: next object_0 object_2

ENVIRONMENT
------------------------------
I am playing with a set of objects. Here are the actions I can do

Paltry object_0 object_1 object_2.
Sip object_0 object_1 object_2.
Clip object_0 object_1 object_2.
Wretched object_0 object_1 object_2 object_3.
Memory object_0 object_1 object_2.
Tightfisted object_0 object_1 object_2.

I have the following restrictions on my actions:
To perform paltry action, the following facts need to be true: hand object_0, cats object_1, texture object_2, vase object_0 object_1, and next object_1 object_2
Once paltry is performed the following facts will be true: next object_0 object_2
Once paltry is performed the following facts will be false: vase object_0 object_1
To perform sip action, the following facts need to be true: hand object_0, cats object_1, texture object_2, next object_0 object_2, and next object_1 object_2
Once sip is performed the following facts will be true: vase object_0 object_1
Once sip is performed the following facts will be false: next object_0 object_2
To perform clip action, the following facts need to be true: hand object_0, sneeze object_1, texture object_2, next object_1 object_2, and next object_0 object_2
Once clip is performed the following facts will be true: vase object_0 object_1
Once clip is performed the following facts will be false: next object_0 object_2
To perform wretched action, the following facts need to be true: sneeze object_0, texture object_1, texture object_2, stupendous object_3, next object_0 object_1, collect object_1 object_3, and collect object_2 object_3
Once wretched is performed the following facts will be true: next object_0 object_2

NATURAL-PLAN sas_plan_10
------------------------------
Here is the human-readable execution of the given plan (timestamps in steps; assume each action takes 1 unit time):

1) t=0, duration=1
   Action: (memory object_0 object_6 object_5)
   Preconditions used: cats object_0; spring object_6; spring object_5; next object_0 object_6
   Effects: add next object_0 object_5; delete next object_0 object_6

2) t=1, duration=1
   Action: (sip object_8 object_0 object_5)
   Preconditions used: hand object_8; cats object_0; texture object_5; next object_8 object_5; next object_0 object_5
   Effects: add vase object_8 object_0; delete next object_8 object_5

3) t=2, duration=1
   Action: (memory object_0 object_5 object_6)
   Preconditions used: cats object_0; spring object_5; spring object_6; next object_0 object_5
   Effects: add next object_0 object_6; delete next object_0 object_5

4) t=3, duration=1
   Action: (paltry object_8 object_0 object_6)
   Preconditions used: hand object_8; cats object_0; texture object_6; vase object_8 object_0; next object_0 object_6
   Effects: add next object_8 object_6; delete vase object_8 object_0

Final state satisfies the goal: next object_7 object_6 (already true initially) and next object_8 object_6 (achieved at step 4).

PROBLEM
------------------------------
I am playing with a set of objects. Here are the actions I can do

Paltry object_0 object_1 object_2.
Sip object_0 object_1 object_2.
Clip object_0 object_1 object_2.
Wretched object_0 object_1 object_2 object_3.
Memory object_0 object_1 object_2.
Tightfisted object_0 object_1 object_2.

I have the following restrictions on my actions:
To perform paltry action, the following facts need to be true: hand object_0, cats object_1, texture object_2, vase object_0 object_1, and next object_1 object_2
Once paltry is performed the following facts will be true: next object_0 object_2
Once paltry is performed the following facts will be false: vase object_0 object_1
To perform sip action, the following facts need to be true: hand object_0, cats object_1, texture object_2, next object_0 object_2, and next object_1 object_2
Once sip is performed the following facts will be true: vase object_0 object_1
Once sip is performed the following facts will be false: next object_0 object_2
To perform clip action, the following facts need to be true: hand object_0, sneeze object_1, texture object_2, next object_1 object_2, and next object_0 object_2

NATURAL-PLAN sas_plan_1
------------------------------
Here is the human-readable sequence of actions that follows the plan exactly and achieves the goal (next object_8 object_7) and (next object_9 object_6). Each step assumes duration = 1 time unit.

- t=0 → t=1
  Action: memory object_1 object_6 object_7
  Description: Redirect object_1’s next-link from object_6 to object_7 (using spring at both). Effect: add next(object_1, object_7); delete next(object_1, object_6).

- t=1 → t=2
  Action: sip object_9 object_1 object_7
  Description: At textured object_7, bind object_9 (in hand) with object_1 (a cat), creating vase(object_9, object_1). Effect: add vase(object_9, object_1); delete next(object_9, object_7).

- t=2 → t=3
  Action: memory object_1 object_7 object_6
  Description: Redirect object_1’s next-link back from object_7 to object_6. Effect: add next(object_1, object_6); delete next(object_1, object_7).

- t=3 → t=4
  Action: paltry object_9 object_1 object_6
  Description: Using vase(object_9, object_1) at textured object_6 and next(object_1, object_6), advance object_9 to object_6 and drop the vase link. Effect: add next(object_9, object_6); delete vase(object_9, object_1).

Result: Goal satisfied — next(object_8, object_7) remains true from the start, and next(object_9, object_6) is achieved at t=4.

PROBLEM
------------------------------
I am playing with a set of objects. Here are the actions I can do

Paltry object_0 object_1 object_2.
Sip object_0 object_1 object_2.
Clip object_0 object_1 object_2.
Wretched object_0 object_1 object_2 object_3.
Memory object_0 object_1 object_2.
Tightfisted object_0 object_1 object_2.

I have the following restrictions on my actions:
To perform paltry action, the following facts need to be true: hand object_0, cats object_1, texture object_2, vase object_0 object_1, and next object_1 object_2
Once paltry is performed the following facts will be true: next object_0 object_2
Once paltry is performed the following facts will be false: vase object_0 object_1
To perform sip action, the following facts need to be true: hand object_0, cats object_1, texture object_2, next object_0 object_2, and next object_1 object_2
Once sip is performed the following facts will be true: vase object_0 object_1
Once sip is performed the following facts will be false: next object_0 object_2
To perform clip action, the following facts need to be true: hand object_0, sneeze object_1, texture object_2, next object_1 object_2, and next object_0 object_2
Once clip is performed the following facts will be true: vase object_0 object_1
Once clip is performed the following facts will be false: next object_0 object_2
To perform wretched action, the following facts need to be true: sneeze object_0, texture object_1, texture object_2, stupendous object_3, next object_0 object_1, collect object_1 object_3, and collect object_2 object_3
Once wretched is performed the following facts will be true: next object_0 object_2
Once wretched is performed the following facts will be false: next object_0 object_1
To perform memory action, the following facts need to be true: cats object_0, spring object_1, spring object_2, and next object_0 object_1
Once memory is performed the following facts will be true: next object_0 object_2
Once memory is performed the following facts will be false: next object_0 object_1
To perform tightfisted action, the following facts need to be true: hand object_0, sneeze object_1, texture object_2, next object_1 object_2, and vase object_0 object_1
Once tightfisted is performed the following facts will be true: next object_0 object_2
Once tightfisted is performed the following facts will be false: vase object_0 object_1

ENVIRONMENT
------------------------------
I am playing with a set of objects. Here are the actions I can do

Paltry object_0 object_1 object_2.
Sip object_0 object_1 object_2.
Clip object_0 object_1 object_2.
Wretched object_0 object_1 object_2 object_3.
Memory object_0 object_1 object_2.
Tightfisted object_0 object_1 object_2.

I have the following restrictions on my actions:
To perform paltry action, the following facts need to be true: hand object_0, cats object_1, texture object_2, vase object_0 object_1, and next object_1 object_2
Once paltry is performed the following facts will be true: next object_0 object_2
Once paltry is performed the following facts will be false: vase object_0 object_1
To perform sip action, the following facts need to be true: hand object_0, cats object_1, texture object_2, next object_0 object_2, and next object_1 object_2
Once sip is performed the following facts will be true: vase object_0 object_1
Once sip is performed the following facts will be false: next object_0 object_2
To perform clip action, the following facts need to be true: hand object_0, sneeze object_1, texture object_2, next object_1 object_2, and next object_0 object_2
Once clip is performed the following facts will be true: vase object_0 object_1
Once clip is performed the following facts will be false: next object_0 object_2
To perform wretched action, the following facts need to be true: sneeze object_0, texture object_1, texture object_2, stupendous object_3, next object_0 object_1, collect object_1 object_3, and collect object_2 object_3
Once wretched is performed the following facts will be true: next object_0 object_2
Once wretched is performed the following facts will be false: next object_0 object_1
To perform memory action, the following facts need to be true: cats object_0, spring object_1, spring object_2, and next object_0 object_1
Once memory is performed the following facts will be true: next object_0 object_2
Once memory is performed the following facts will be false: next object_0 object_1
To perform tightfisted action, the following facts need to be true: hand object_0, sneeze object_1, texture object_2, next object_1 object_2, and vase object_0 object_1
Once tightfisted is performed the following facts will be true: next object_0 object_2
Once tightfisted is performed the following facts will be false: vase object_0 object_1

NATURAL-PLAN sas_plan_1
------------------------------
Here is the exact sequence of actions to achieve the goal, with timestamps and brief effects.

- Step 1 (t=0 to t=1): clip object_9 object_4 object_7
  - Effects: add vase object_9 object_4; delete next object_9 object_7.

- Step 2 (t=1 to t=2): wretched object_4 object_7 object_8 object_2
  - Effects: add next object_4 object_8; delete next object_4 object_7.

- Step 3 (t=2 to t=3): tightfisted object_9 object_4 object_8
  - Effects: add next object_9 object_8; delete vase object_9 object_4.

Final state satisfies the goal: next object_9 object_8.

NATURAL-PLAN sas_plan_1
------------------------------
Human-readable action sequence to achieve goal: next(object_10, object_6)

- Step 1 (t=0, dur=1): clip object_10 object_5 object_9
  Description: Using hand(object_10), sneeze(object_5), and texture(object_9) with both at next(..., object_9), create vase(object_10, object_5) and remove next(object_10, object_9).

- Step 2 (t=1, dur=1): wretched object_5 object_9 object_8 object_3
  Description: With sneeze(object_5), textures on object_9 and object_8, stupendous(object_3), and collect(object_9, object_3), collect(object_8, object_3), shift adjacency of object_5 from object_9 to object_8 (add next(object_5, object_8), delete next(object_5, object_9)).

- Step 3 (t=2, dur=1): tightfisted object_10 object_5 object_8
  Description: Using vase(object_10, object_5), sneeze(object_5), texture(object_8), and next(object_5, object_8), set next(object_10, object_8) and remove vase(object_10, object_5).

- Step 4 (t=3, dur=1): sip object_10 object_0 object_8
  Description: With hand(object_10), cats(object_0), texture(object_8), and both next(object_10, object_8) and next(object_0, object_8), create vase(object_10, object_0) and remove next(object_10, object_8).

- Step 5 (t=4, dur=1): memory object_0 object_8 object_6
  Description: Using cats(object_0), spring(object_8), spring(object_6), and next(object_0, object_8), shift adjacency to next(object_0, object_6) and remove next(object_0, object_8).

- Step 6 (t=5, dur=1): paltry object_10 object_0 object_6
  Description: With hand(object_10), cats(object_0), texture(object_6), vase(object_10, object_0), and next(object_0, object_6), set next(object_10, object_6) and remove vase(object_10, object_0).

Result: Goal achieved — next(object_10, object_6).

NATURAL-PLAN sas_plan_1
------------------------------
Here is the human-readable sequence of actions following the given plan exactly. Timestamps use unit steps (duration = 1):

1) t=0, duration=1 — clip object_9 object_4 object_8
   - Effect: establishes vase(object_9, object_4) and removes next(object_9, object_8).

2) t=1, duration=1 — wretched object_4 object_8 object_7 object_2
   - Effect: redirects next for object_4 from object_8 to object_7 (adds next(object_4, object_7), deletes next(object_4, object_8)).

3) t=2, duration=1 — tightfisted object_9 object_4 object_7
   - Effect: sets next(object_9, object_7) and removes vase(object_9, object_4).

Goal status at end:
- next(object_10, object_5) remains true from the initial state.
- next(object_9, object_7) achieved at t=2.
Both goal conditions are satisfied.

1) t=0 -> t=1: clip object_9 object_4 object_8
   - Preconditions: hand(object_9), sneeze(object_4), texture(object_8), next(object_4, object_8), next(object_9, object_8)
   - Effects: vase(object_9, object_4); not next(object_9, object_8)

2) t=1 -> t=2: wretched object_4 object_8 object_7 object_2
   - Preconditions: sneeze(object_4), texture(object_8), texture(object_7), stupendous(object_2), next(object_4, object_8), collect(object_8, object_2), collect(object_7, object_2)
   - Effects: next(object_4, object_7); not next(object_4, object_8)

3) t=2 -> t=3: tightfisted object_9 object_4 object_7

  Result: establish vase(object_9, object_3); remove next(object_9, object_5).

- t=1 to 2 (duration 1): Perform CLIP(hand=object_10, sneezer=object_3, texture=object_5).
  Result: establish vase(object_10, object_3); remove next(object_10, object_5).

- t=2 to 3 (duration 1): Perform WRETCHED(sneezer=object_3, from_texture=object_5, to_texture=object_6, group=object_1).
  Result: move sneezer link next(object_3, •) from object_5 to object_6 (add next(object_3, object_6); delete next(object_3, object_5)).

- t=3 to 4 (duration 1): Perform TIGHTFISTED(hand=object_9, sneezer=object_3, texture=object_6).
  Result: add next(object_9, object_6); remove vase(object_9, object_3).

- t=4 to 5 (duration 1): Perform TIGHTFISTED(hand=object_10, sneezer=object_3, texture=object_6).
  Result: add next(object_10, object_6); remove vase(object_10, object_3).

Final outcome: next(object_9, object_6) and next(object_10, object_6) are true, satisfying the goal.

   Effect: Switch next(object_4, •) from object_7 to object_8.

2) t=00:01, Δ=1
   clip(object_10, object_4, object_8)
   Effect: Add vase(object_10, object_4); remove next(object_10, object_8).

3) t=00:02, Δ=1
   wretched(object_4, object_8, object_7, object_2)
   Effect: Switch next(object_4, •) from object_8 back to object_7.

4) t=00:03, Δ=1
   tightfisted(object_10, object_4, object_7)
   Effect: Add next(object_10, object_7); remove vase(object_10, object_4).

5) t=00:04, Δ=1
   wretched(object_3, object_5, object_6, object_1)
   Effect: Switch next(object_3, •) from object_5 to object_6.

6) t=00:05, Δ=1

7) t=00:06, Δ=1
   wretched(object_3, object_6, object_5, object_1)
   Effect: Switch next(object_3, •) from object_6 back to object_5.

8) t=00:07, Δ=1
   tightfisted(object_11, object_3, object_5)
   Effect: Add next(object_11, object_5); remove vase(object_11, object_3).

9) t=00:08, Δ=1
   sip(object_9, object_0, object_5)
   Effect: Add vase(object_9, object_0); remove next(object_9, object_5).

10) t=00:09, Δ=1
    sip(object_11, object_0, object_5)
    Effect: Add vase(object_11, object_0); remove next(object_11, object_5).

11) t=00:10, Δ=1
    memory(object_0, object_5, object_7)
    Effect: Switch next(object_0, •) from object_5 to object_7.

12) t=00:11, Δ=1
    paltry(object_9, object_0, object_7)
    Effect: Add next(object_9, object_7); remove vase(object_9, object_0).

13) t=00:12, Δ=1

PROBLEM
------------------------------
I am playing with a set of objects. Here are the actions I can do

Paltry object_0 object_1 object_2.
Sip object_0 object_1 object_2.
Clip object_0 object_1 object_2.
Wretched object_0 object_1 object_2 object_3.
Memory object_0 object_1 object_2.
Tightfisted object_0 object_1 object_2.

I have the following restrictions on my actions:
To perform paltry action, the following facts need to be true: hand object_0, cats object_1, texture object_2, vase object_0 object_1, and next object_1 object_2
Once paltry is performed the following facts will be true: next object_0 object_2
Once paltry is performed the following facts will be false: vase object_0 object_1
To perform sip action, the following facts need to be true: hand object_0, cats object_1, texture object_2, next object_0 object_2, and next object_1 object_2
Once sip is performed the following facts will be true: vase object_0 object_1
Once sip is performed the following facts will be false: next object_0 object_2
To perform clip action, the following facts need to be true: hand object_0, sneeze object_1, texture object_2, next object_1 object_2, and next object_0 object_2
Once clip is performed the following facts will be true: vase object_0 object_1
Once clip is performed the following facts will be false: next object_0 object_2
To perform wretched action, the following facts need to be true: sneeze object_0, texture object_1, texture object_2, stupendous object_3, next object_0 object_1, collect object_1 object_3, and collect object_2 object_3
Once wretched is performed the following facts will be true: next object_0 object_2
Once wretched is performed the following facts will be false: next object_0 object_1
To perform memory action, the following facts need to be true: cats object_0, spring object_1, spring object_2, and next object_0 object_1
Once memory is performed the following facts will be true: next object_0 object_2
Once memory is performed the following facts will be false: next object_0 object_1
To perform tightfisted action, the following facts need to be true: hand object_0, sneeze object_1, texture object_2, next object_1 object_2, and vase object_0 object_1
Once tightfisted is performed the following facts will be true: next object_0 object_2

NATURAL-PLAN sas_plan_1
------------------------------
Execution plan to achieve goal: next object_10 object_7, next object_11 object_7, next object_12 object_7. Each step is sequential with duration Δt=1.

1) t=00:00 (Δt=1) — clip object_11 object_5 object_9
- Use hand object_11 with sneeze object_5 at textured object_9 to form a vase link; this consumes the path from object_11 to object_9.

2) t=00:01 (Δt=1) — wretched object_5 object_9 object_8 object_3
- Reroute sneeze object_5 from object_9 to object_8 using stupendous object_3 and the required collect links.

3) t=00:02 (Δt=1) — tightfisted object_11 object_5 object_8
- With the vase link between object_11 and object_5 and path object_5→object_8, establish path object_11→object_8 and drop that vase link.

4) t=00:03 (Δt=1) — clip object_12 object_4 object_6
- Use hand object_12 with sneeze object_4 at textured object_6 to form a vase link; this consumes the path from object_12 to object_6.

5) t=00:04 (Δt=1) — sip object_11 object_0 object_8
- Pair hand object_11 with cats object_0 at textured object_8 to create a vase link; this consumes the path from object_11 to object_8.

6) t=00:05 (Δt=1) — sip object_10 object_0 object_8
- Pair hand object_10 with cats object_0 at textured object_8 to create a vase link; this consumes the path from object_10 to object_8.

7) t=00:06 (Δt=1) — memory object_0 object_8 object_6
- Move cats object_0’s path from object_8 to object_6 using the spring facts.

8) t=00:07 (Δt=1) — paltry object_11 object_0 object_6
- Using the vase link (object_11, object_0) and path object_0→object_6 at textured object_6, establish path object_11→object_6 and drop that vase link.

9) t=00:08 (Δt=1) — clip object_11 object_4 object_6
- Use hand object_11 with sneeze object_4 at textured object_6 to form a vase link; this consumes the path from object_11 to object_6.

10) t=00:09 (Δt=1) — paltry object_10 object_0 object_6
- Using the vase link (object_10, object_0) and path object_0→object_6 at textured object_6, establish path object_10→object_6 and drop that vase link.

11) t=00:10 (Δt=1) — clip object_10 object_4 object_6
- Use hand object_10 with sneeze object_4 at textured object_6 to form a vase link; this consumes the path from object_10 to object_6.

12) t=00:11 (Δt=1) — wretched object_4 object_6 object_7 object_2
- Reroute sneeze object_4 from object_6 to object_7 using stupendous object_2 and the required collect links.

13) t=00:12 (Δt=1) — tightfisted object_12 object_4 object_7
- With the vase link (object_12, object_4) and path object_4→object_7 at textured object_7, establish path object_12→object_7 and drop that vase link.

14) t=00:13 (Δt=1) — tightfisted object_11 object_4 object_7
- With the vase link (object_11, object_4) and path object_4→object_7 at textured object_7, establish path object_11→object_7 and drop that vase link.

15) t=00:14 (Δt=1) — tightfisted object_10 object_4 object_7
- With the vase link (object_10, object_4) and path object_4→object_7 at textured object_7, establish path object_10→object_7 and drop that vase link.

Result: Achieves the final goal state — next object_10 object_7, next object_11 object_7, next object_12 object_7.

ENVIRONMENT
------------------------------
I am playing with a set of objects. Here are the actions I can do

Paltry object_0 object_1 object_2.
Sip object_0 object_1 object_2.
Clip object_0 object_1 object_2.
Wretched object_0 object_1 object_2 object_3.
Memory object_0 object_1 object_2.
Tightfisted object_0 object_1 object_2.

I have the following restrictions on my actions:
To perform paltry action, the following facts need to be true: hand object_0, cats object_1, texture object_2, vase object_0 object_1, and next object_1 object_2
Once paltry is performed the following facts will be true: next object_0 object_2
Once paltry is performed the following facts will be false: vase object_0 object_1
To perform sip action, the following facts need to be true: hand object_0, cats object_1, texture object_2, next object_0 object_2, and next object_1 object_2
Once sip is performed the following facts will be true: vase object_0 object_1
Once sip is performed the following facts will be false: next object_0 object_2

Creating the required vase(object_11, object_3) via clip would require aligning next(object_11, X) with next(object_3, X), but object_11 can only be kept/aligned within {object_7, object_8} without already having a vase, so no X \u2208 {object_5, object_6} can be simultaneously achieved to enable clip with object_3. Consequently, next(object_11, object_6) cannot be established. A partial feasible outline that attains the other three goals is possible (e.g., next(object_10, object_8), next(object_12, object_8), next(object_9, object_5)), but it cannot satisfy the full Statement 2 goal set."

Creating the required vase(object_11, object_3) via clip would require aligning next(object_11, X) with next(object_3, X), but object_11 can only be kept/aligned within {object_7, object_8} without already having a vase, so no X \u2208 {object_5, object_6} can be simultaneously achieved to enable clip with object_3. Consequently, next(object_11, object_6) cannot be established. A partial feasible outline that attains the other three goals is possible (e.g., next(object_10, object_8), next(object_12, object_8), next(object_9, object_5)), but it cannot satisfy the full Statement 2 goal set."

Creating the required vase(object_11, object_3) via clip would require aligning next(object_11, X) with next(object_3, X), but object_11 can only be kept/aligned within {object_7, object_8} without already having a vase, so no X \u2208 {object_5, object_6} can be simultaneously achieved to enable clip with object_3. Consequently, next(object_11, object_6) cannot be established. A partial feasible outline that attains the other three goals is possible (e.g., next(object_10, object_8), next(object_12, object_8), next(object_9, object_5)), but it cannot satisfy the full Statement 2 goal set."

A partial feasible outline that attains the other three goals is possible (e.g., next(object_10, object_8), next(object_12, object_8), next(object_9, object_5)), but it cannot satisfy the full Statement 2 goal set."

The sneeze carriers partition their reachable \u201cnext\u201d textures into disjoint sets: object_3 can only toggle between {object_5, object_6} via wretched with object_1, and object_4 can only toggle between {object_7, object_8} via wretched with object_2. Creating the required vase(object_11, object_3) via clip would require aligning next(object_11, X) with next(object_3, X), but object_11 can only be kept/aligned within {object_7, object_8} without already having a vase, so no X \u2208 {object_5, object_6} can be simultaneously achieved to enable clip with object_3. Consequently, next(object_11, object_6) cannot be established. A partial feasible outline that attains the other three goals is possible (e.g., next(object_10, object_8), next(object_12, object_8), next(object_9, object_5)), but it cannot satisfy the full Statement 2 goal set."

Creating the required vase(object_11, object_3) via clip would require aligning next(object_11, X) with next(object_3, X), but object_11 can only be kept/aligned within {object_7, object_8} without already having a vase, so no X \u2208 {object_5, object_6} can be simultaneously achieved to enable clip with object_3. Consequently, next(object_11, object_6) cannot be established. A partial feasible outline that attains the other three goals is possible (e.g., next(object_10, object_8), next(object_12, object_8), next(object_9, object_5)), but it cannot satisfy the full Statement 2 goal set."

Creating the required vase(object_11, object_3) via clip would require aligning next(object_11, X) with next(object_3, X), but object_11 can only be kept/aligned within {object_7, object_8} without already having a vase, so no X \u2208 {object_5, object_6} can be simultaneously achieved to enable clip with object_3. Consequently, next(object_11, object_6) cannot be established. A partial feasible outline that attains the other three goals is possible (e.g., next(object_10, object_8), next(object_12, object_8), next(object_9, object_5)), but it cannot satisfy the full Statement 2 goal set."

Creating the required vase(object_11, object_3) via clip would require aligning next(object_11, X) with next(object_3, X), but object_11 can only be kept/aligned within {object_7, object_8} without already having a vase, so no X \u2208 {object_5, object_6} can be simultaneously achieved to enable clip with object_3. Consequently, next(object_11, object_6) cannot be established. A partial feasible outline that attains the other three goals is possible (e.g., next(object_10, object_8), next(object_12, object_8), next(object_9, object_5)), but it cannot satisfy the full Statement 2 goal set."

Creating the required vase(object_11, object_3) via clip would require aligning next(object_11, X) with next(object_3, X), but object_11 can only be kept/aligned within {object_7, object_8} without already having a vase, so no X \u2208 {object_5, object_6} can be simultaneously achieved to enable clip with object_3. Consequently, next(object_11, object_6) cannot be established. A partial feasible outline that attains the other three goals is possible (e.g., next(object_10, object_8), next(object_12, object_8), next(object_9, object_5)), but it cannot satisfy the full Statement 2 goal set."

The sneeze carriers partition their reachable \u201cnext\u201d textures into disjoint sets: object_3 can only toggle between {object_5, object_6} via wretched with object_1, and object_4 can only toggle between {object_7, object_8} via wretched with object_2. Creating the required vase(object_11, object_3) via clip would require aligning next(object_11, X) with next(object_3, X), but object_11 can only be kept/aligned within {object_7, object_8} without already having a vase, so no X \u2208 {object_5, object_6} can be simultaneously achieved to enable clip with object_3. Consequently, next(object_11, object_6) cannot be established. A partial feasible outline that attains the other three goals is possible (e.g., next(object_10, object_8), next(object_12, object_8), next(object_9, object_5)), but it cannot satisfy the full Statement 2 goal set."

NATURAL-PLAN sas_plan_10
------------------------------
Here is the human-readable sequence of actions that follows the provided plan exactly. Each step is sequential, with a nominal duration of 1s and timestamps in seconds.

1. t=0s–1s: clip object_10 object_4 object_8
2. t=1s–2s: wretched object_4 object_8 object_7 object_2
3. t=2s–3s: tightfisted object_10 object_4 object_7
4. t=3s–4s: wretched object_3 object_5 object_6 object_1
5. t=4s–5s: clip object_12 object_3 object_6
6. t=5s–6s: sip object_9 object_0 object_7
7. t=6s–7s: sip object_10 object_0 object_7
8. t=7s–8s: memory object_0 object_7 object_5
9. t=8s–9s: paltry object_9 object_0 object_5
10. t=9s–10s: sip object_11 object_0 object_5
11. t=10s–11s: paltry object_10 object_0 object_5
12. t=11s–12s: wretched object_3 object_6 object_5 object_1
13. t=12s–13s: clip object_9 object_3 object_5
14. t=13s–14s: tightfisted object_12 object_3 object_5
15. t=14s–15s: clip object_10 object_3 object_5
16. t=15s–16s: wretched object_3 object_5 object_6 object_1
17. t=16s–17s: tightfisted object_9 object_3 object_6
18. t=17s–18s: tightfisted object_10 object_3 object_6
19. t=18s–19s: sip object_12 object_0 object_5
20. t=19s–20s: memory object_0 object_5 object_7
21. t=20s–21s: paltry object_12 object_0 object_7
22. t=21s–22s: paltry object_11 object_0 object_7

Result: After step 22, the goal is satisfied:
- next object_10 object_6
- next object_11 object_7

PROBLEM
------------------------------
I am playing with a set of objects. Here are the actions I can do

Paltry object_0 object_1 object_2.
Sip object_0 object_1 object_2.
Clip object_0 object_1 object_2.
Wretched object_0 object_1 object_2 object_3.
Memory object_0 object_1 object_2.
Tightfisted object_0 object_1 object_2.

I have the following restrictions on my actions:
To perform paltry action, the following facts need to be true: hand object_0, cats object_1, texture object_2, vase object_0 object_1, and next object_1 object_2
Once paltry is performed the following facts will be true: next object_0 object_2
Once paltry is performed the following facts will be false: vase object_0 object_1
To perform sip action, the following facts need to be true: hand object_0, cats object_1, texture object_2, next object_0 object_2, and next object_1 object_2
Once sip is performed the following facts will be true: vase object_0 object_1
Once sip is performed the following facts will be false: next object_0 object_2
To perform clip action, the following facts need to be true: hand object_0, sneeze object_1, texture object_2, next object_1 object_2, and next object_0 object_2
Once clip is performed the following facts will be true: vase object_0 object_1
Once clip is performed the following facts will be false: next object_0 object_2
To perform wretched action, the following facts need to be true: sneeze object_0, texture object_1, texture object_2, stupendous object_3, next object_0 object_1, collect object_1 object_3, and collect object_2 object_3

FINAL-PLAN
------------------------------
I’m missing the two structured inputs you mentioned. Please provide:
- The domain catalog detailing predicates, object types (if any), and exact semantics for actions paltry, sip, clip, wretched, memory, tightfisted (parameters, preconditions, add/delete effects).
- The normalized problem instance for Scenario B: all objects, initial facts, hard constraints (including any “preferences” to be treated as hard constraints), and the goal specification.

Once I have those, I’ll return a FastDownward-compatible PDDL domain and a Scenario B problem in the requested two tagged sections.

- Step 1 (t=0–1): wretched(a=object_3, b=object_7, c=object_6, d=object_1). Redirect next(object_3, object_7) to next(object_3, object_6).
- Step 2 (t=1–2): clip(x=object_11, y=object_3, z=object_6). Create vase(object_11, object_3); remove next(object_11, object_6).
- Step 3 (t=2–3): wretched(a=object_3, b=object_6, c=object_5, d=object_1). Redirect next(object_3, object_6) to next(object_3, object_5).
- Step 4 (t=3–4): tightfisted(x=object_11, y=object_3, z=object_5). Create next(object_11, object_5); remove vase(object_11, object_3).
- Step 5 (t=4–5): memory(x=object_0, y=object_8, z=object_5). Redirect next(object_0, object_8) to next(object_0, object_5).
- Step 6 (t=5–6): sip(x=object_11, y=object_0, z=object_5). Create vase(object_11, object_0); remove next(object_11, object_5).
- Step 7 (t=6–7): memory(x=object_0, y=object_5, z=object_8). Redirect next(object_0, object_5) to next(object_0, object_8).
- Step 8 (t=7–8): paltry(x=object_11, y=object_0, z=object_8). Create next(object_11, object_8); remove vase(object_11, object_0).
- Step 9 (t=8–9): clip(x=object_11, y=object_4, z=object_8). Create vase(object_11, object_4); remove next(object_11, object_8).
- Step 10 (t=9–10): wretched(a=object_4, b=object_8, c=object_10, d=object_2). Redirect next(object_4, object_8) to next(object_4, object_10).
- Step 11 (t=10–11): tightfisted(x=object_11, y=object_4, z=object_10). Create next(object_11, object_10); remove vase(object_11, object_4).

Result: Goal achieved — next(object_11, object_10) holds.

NATURAL-PLAN sas_plan_1
------------------------------
Here is the human-readable execution of the plan that achieves the goal next object_11 object_9:

- Step 1 (t=0): wretched object_4 object_10 object_8 object_2
  Description: Using sneeze object_4, textures object_10 and object_8, stupendous object_2, and the collects with object_2, redirect object_4’s successor from object_10 to object_8.
  Effect: Adds next object_4 object_8; deletes next object_4 object_10.

- Step 2 (t=1): clip object_11 object_4 object_8
  Description: With hand object_11, sneeze object_4, texture object_8, and both next object_4 object_8 and next object_11 object_8, establish a vase link between object_11 and object_4.
  Effect: Adds vase object_11 object_4; deletes next object_11 object_8.

- Step 3 (t=2): wretched object_4 object_8 object_9 object_2
  Description: Using sneeze object_4, textures object_8 and object_9, stupendous object_2, and the collects with object_2, redirect object_4’s successor from object_8 to object_9.
  Effect: Adds next object_4 object_9; deletes next object_4 object_8.

- Step 4 (t=3): tightfisted object_11 object_4 object_9
  Description: With hand object_11, sneeze object_4, texture object_9, next object_4 object_9, and vase object_11 object_4, advance object_11’s successor to object_9.
  Effect: Adds next object_11 object_9; deletes vase object_11 object_4.

Goal achieved: next object_11 object_9.

------------------------------
Here is the human-readable execution of the given plan. Each step is instantaneous with an assumed duration of 1 time unit.

- Step 1 (t=0, duration=1): wretched(object_4, object_10, object_8, object_2)
  - Effect: Replace next(object_4, object_10) with next(object_4, object_8).

- Step 2 (t=1, duration=1): clip(object_11, object_4, object_8)
  - Effect: Add vase(object_11, object_4); remove next(object_11, object_8).

- Step 3 (t=2, duration=1): wretched(object_4, object_8, object_9, object_2)
  - Effect: Replace next(object_4, object_8) with next(object_4, object_9).

- Step 4 (t=3, duration=1): tightfisted(object_11, object_4, object_9)
  - Effect: Add next(object_11, object_9); remove vase(object_11, object_4).

Result: Goal achieved — next(object_11, object_9).

NATURAL-PLAN sas_plan_8
------------------------------
Here is the human-readable sequence that follows the given plan exactly. Each action starts at the indicated time and has duration 1 (unit cost).

- t=0 to t=1: (wretched object_5 object_9 object_10 object_2) — Redirect object_5’s next-link from object_9 to object_10 using the wretched operation.
- t=1 to t=2: (clip object_12 object_5 object_10) — Using texture at object_10, bind object_12 to object_5 (create vase(object_12, object_5)).
- t=2 to t=3: (wretched object_5 object_10 object_11 object_3) — Redirect object_5’s next-link from object_10 to object_11.
- t=3 to t=4: (tightfisted object_12 object_5 object_11) — From the vase link, advance object_12 to next object_11 and remove the vase link (achieves next object_12 object_11).
- t=4 to t=5: (wretched object_4 object_7 object_9 object_2) — Redirect object_4’s next-link from object_7 to object_9.
- t=5 to t=6: (clip object_11 object_4 object_9) — Using texture at object_9, bind object_11 to object_4 (create vase(object_11, object_4)).
- t=6 to t=7: (wretched object_4 object_9 object_7 object_2) — Redirect object_4’s next-link from object_9 back to object_7.
- t=7 to t=8: (tightfisted object_11 object_4 object_7) — From the vase link, advance object_11 to next object_7 and remove the vase link (achieves next object_11 object_7).

Final goals satisfied:
- next object_12 object_11
- next object_11 object_7

NATURAL-PLAN sas_plan_1
------------------------------
Here is the human-readable sequence of actions that follows the given plan exactly and achieves the goal:

1) [t=0, duration=1] clip(object_12, object_4, object_10)
   - Use the hand-held object_12 with the sneezing object_4 at textured object_10 where both are at object_10; establish vase(object_12, object_4) and remove next(object_12, object_10).

2) [t=1, duration=1] wretched(object_4, object_10, object_8, object_2)
   - Reroute object_4 from next(object_4, object_10) to next(object_4, object_8) using stupendous object_2 and the required collections; add next(object_4, object_8) and delete next(object_4, object_10).

3) [t=2, duration=1] tightfisted(object_12, object_4, object_8)
   - Using vase(object_12, object_4) and next(object_4, object_8), place object_12 next to object_8; add next(object_12, object_8) and remove vase(object_12, object_4).

4) [t=3, duration=1] wretched(object_3, object_7, object_6, object_1)
   - Shift object_3 from next(object_3, object_7) to next(object_3, object_6) using stupendous object_1 and the required collections; add next(object_3, object_6) and delete next(object_3, object_7).

5) [t=4, duration=1] clip(object_11, object_3, object_6)
   - Bind hand-held object_11 with sneezing object_3 at textured object_6 where both are at object_6; establish vase(object_11, object_3) and remove next(object_11, object_6).

6) [t=5, duration=1] wretched(object_3, object_6, object_7, object_1)
   - Reroute object_3 from next(object_3, object_6) back to next(object_3, object_7); add next(object_3, object_7) and delete next(object_3, object_6).

7) [t=6, duration=1] tightfisted(object_11, object_3, object_7)
   - Using vase(object_11, object_3) and next(object_3, object_7), place object_11 next to object_7; add next(object_11, object_7) and remove vase(object_11, object_3).

Result: Goal satisfied with next(object_12, object_8) from step 3 and next(object_11, object_7) from step 7.

================================================================================


FINAL-PLAN
------------------------------
I’m missing the “normalized contexts” (public action models and the two scenario facts/goals). To generate a correct FastDownward-compatible domain and the two problems without inventing details, please provide:

1) Public action models (must match exactly)
- For each action: paltry, sip, clip, wretched, memory, tightfisted
  - Preconditions: list of positive and negative literals over the given predicates
  - Effects: list of add and delete effects (and any negative preconditions required)
  - Note: Only the provided predicates are allowed: 
    - Unary: hand, cats, sneeze, spring, texture, stupendous
    - Binary: next ?x ?y, vase ?x ?y, collect ?x ?y
  - No unsupported features (no quantifiers, no conditionals).

2) Problem S1 (depots23-s1)
- Full object list (symbols like object_1, object_2, …) that cover “all mentioned object_* in S1”
- Complete initial state: all true atoms over the above predicates
- Complete goal: a conjunction of literals (positive/negative) as strict constraints
- Any hard ordering/availability constraints derived from preferences (e.g., “avoid X”, “earliest Y”) expressed as state constraints we must enforce via goals/initial facts.

3) Problem S2 (depots23-s2)
- Same items as for S1, using only “all mentioned object_* in S2”

Once you share those, I will return:
- One <domain>…</domain> block with :requirements :strips :typing :negative-preconditions and type obj
- Two problem blocks <problem name="depots23-s1">…</problem> and <problem name="depots23-s2">…</problem>
- No placeholders; all content fully specified and compatible with FastDownward.

NATURAL-PLAN sas_plan_10
------------------------------
Human-readable execution plan for depots23-s1 (7 steps, unit duration each)

1) t=0 to t=1 (duration 1)
   Action: clip object_12 object_4 object_10
   Effect: establish vase(object_12, object_4); remove next(object_12, object_10).

2) t=1 to t=2 (duration 1)
   Action: wretched object_4 object_10 object_8 object_2
   Effect: switch next to next(object_4, object_8); remove next(object_4, object_10).

3) t=2 to t=3 (duration 1)
   Action: tightfisted object_12 object_4 object_8
   Effect: set next(object_12, object_8); remove vase(object_12, object_4).
   Note: This achieves goal component next(object_12, object_8).

4) t=3 to t=4 (duration 1)
   Action: wretched object_3 object_7 object_6 object_1
   Effect: switch next to next(object_3, object_6); remove next(object_3, object_7).

5) t=4 to t=5 (duration 1)
   Action: clip object_11 object_3 object_6
   Effect: establish vase(object_11, object_3); remove next(object_11, object_6).

6) t=5 to t=6 (duration 1)
   Action: wretched object_3 object_6 object_7 object_1
   Effect: switch next to next(object_3, object_7); remove next(object_3, object_6).

7) t=6 to t=7 (duration 1)
   Action: tightfisted object_11 object_3 object_7
   Effect: set next(object_11, object_7); remove vase(object_11, object_3).
   Note: This achieves goal component next(object_11, object_7).

Final outcome: Both goal facts are satisfied — next(object_12, object_8) and next(object_11, object_7).

PROBLEM
------------------------------
I am playing with a set of objects. Here are the actions I can do

Paltry object_0 object_1 object_2.
Sip object_0 object_1 object_2.
Clip object_0 object_1 object_2.
Wretched object_0 object_1 object_2 object_3.
Memory object_0 object_1 object_2.
Tightfisted object_0 object_1 object_2.

I have the following restrictions on my actions:
To perform paltry action, the following facts need to be true: hand object_0, cats object_1, texture object_2, vase object_0 object_1, and next object_1 object_2
Once paltry is performed the following facts will be true: next object_0 object_2

NATURAL-PLAN sas_plan_1
------------------------------
Here is the human-readable action sequence that follows the provided plan exactly. Each action is listed with a timestamp window (assuming unit-duration steps of 1 minute) and a brief effect summary consistent with the domain.

- Step 1 (00:00–00:01): clip(object_13, object_4, object_7) — adds vase(object_13, object_4); deletes next(object_13, object_7).
- Step 2 (00:01–00:02): clip(object_12, object_4, object_7) — adds vase(object_12, object_4); deletes next(object_12, object_7).
- Step 3 (00:02–00:03): wretched(object_4, object_7, object_10, object_2) — adds next(object_4, object_10); deletes next(object_4, object_7).
- Step 4 (00:03–00:04): tightfisted(object_13, object_4, object_10) — adds next(object_13, object_10); deletes vase(object_13, object_4).
- Step 5 (00:04–00:05): wretched(object_4, object_9, object_11, object_3) — adds next(object_4, object_11); deletes next(object_4, object_9).
- Step 6 (00:05–00:06): wretched(object_4, object_10, object_6, object_2) — adds next(object_4, object_6); deletes next(object_4, object_10).
- Step 7 (00:06–00:07): tightfisted(object_12, object_4, object_6) — adds next(object_12, object_6); deletes vase(object_12, object_4).
- Step 8 (00:07–00:08): wretched(object_4, object_6, object_8, object_2) — adds next(object_4, object_8); deletes next(object_4, object_6).
- Step 9 (00:08–00:09): clip(object_12, object_4, object_11) — adds vase(object_12, object_4); deletes next(object_12, object_11).
- Step 10 (00:09–00:10): clip(object_14, object_4, object_8) — adds vase(object_14, object_4); deletes next(object_14, object_8).
- Step 11 (00:10–00:11): tightfisted(object_14, object_4, object_11) — adds next(object_14, object_11); deletes vase(object_14, object_4).
- Step 12 (00:11–00:12): wretched(object_4, object_8, object_9, object_2) — adds next(object_4, object_9); deletes next(object_4, object_8).
- Step 13 (00:12–00:13): tightfisted(object_12, object_4, object_9) — adds next(object_12, object_9); deletes vase(object_12, object_4).
- Step 14 (00:13–00:14): wretched(object_3, object_6, object_10, object_2) — adds next(object_3, object_10); deletes next(object_3, object_6).
- Step 15 (00:14–00:15): clip(object_11, object_3, object_10) — adds vase(object_11, object_3); deletes next(object_11, object_10).
- Step 16 (00:15–00:16): wretched(object_3, object_10, object_7, object_2) — adds next(object_3, object_7); deletes next(object_3, object_10).
- Step 17 (00:16–00:17): wretched(object_3, object_7, object_5, object_1) — adds next(object_3, object_5); deletes next(object_3, object_7).
- Step 18 (00:17–00:18): tightfisted(object_11, object_3, object_5) — adds next(object_11, object_5); deletes vase(object_11, object_3).

Result: Achieves all goals — next(object_11, object_5), next(object_12, object_9), next(object_13, object_10), next(object_12, object_6), and next(object_14, object_11).
