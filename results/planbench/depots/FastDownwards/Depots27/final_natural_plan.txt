Plan (human-readable, step-by-step)

Step 1 — Time 0.0 → 1.0 (duration 1.0, cost = 1)
- Action: pa-paltry(o1, o2, o3)
- Parameters: 
  - ?a = o1
  - ?b = o2
  - ?c = o3
- Preconditions (checked against the initial state):
  - (hand o1 o2) — PRESENT in initial state
  - (cats o2 o3) — PRESENT in initial state
  - (texture o3 o1) — PRESENT in initial state
  => All preconditions are satisfied at time 0.0.
- Effects (applied at time 1.0):
  - Add: (vase o2 o3)
  - Add: (next o1 o3)
  - Delete: (hand o1 o2)
- Resulting important facts after the step:
  - (vase o2 o3) — now true (satisfies goal)
  - (next o1 o3) — now true (satisfies goal)
  - (hand o1 o2) — no longer true
- Goal check: Both goal atoms (next o1 o3) and (vase o2 o3) are achieved after this single action.

No other actions are executed. The plan completes at time 1.0 with the goals satisfied.
