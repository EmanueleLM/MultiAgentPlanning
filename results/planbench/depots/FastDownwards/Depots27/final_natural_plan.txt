Sequential execution schedule (assumed unit duration per action). Each step lists start–end times.

1. 0.00–1.00: wretched(object_4, object_7, object_8, object_2)
2. 1.00–2.00: clip(object_14, object_4, object_8)
3. 2.00–3.00: clip(object_13, object_4, object_8)
4. 3.00–4.00: wretched(object_4, object_8, object_6, object_2)
5. 4.00–5.00: tightfisted(object_14, object_4, object_6)
6. 5.00–6.00: tightfisted(object_13, object_4, object_6)
7. 6.00–7.00: sip(object_14, object_1, object_6)
8. 7.00–8.00: sip(object_13, object_1, object_6)
9. 8.00–9.00: memory(object_1, object_6, object_9)
10. 9.00–10.00: paltry(object_14, object_1, object_9)
11. 10.00–11.00: paltry(object_13, object_1, object_9)
12. 11.00–12.00: wretched(object_5, object_10, object_11, object_3)
13. 12.00–13.00: clip(object_12, object_5, object_11)
14. 13.00–14.00: wretched(object_5, object_11, object_9, object_3)
15. 14.00–15.00: clip(object_14, object_5, object_9)
16. 15.00–16.00: clip(object_13, object_5, object_9)
17. 16.00–17.00: tightfisted(object_12, object_5, object_9)
18. 17.00–18.00: wretched(object_5, object_9, object_10, object_3)
19. 18.00–19.00: tightfisted(object_13, object_5, object_10)
20. 19.00–20.00: wretched(object_5, object_10, object_11, object_3)
21. 20.00–21.00: tightfisted(object_14, object_5, object_11)
22. 21.00–22.00: sip(object_12, object_1, object_9)
23. 22.00–23.00: memory(object_1, object_9, object_6)
24. 23.00–24.00: paltry(object_12, object_1, object_6)

Outcome: achieves the goal facts next(object_12, object_6), next(object_13, object_10), and next(object_14, object_11).
