Here is the human-readable sequence of actions that follows the provided plan exactly. Each step lists a timestamp (seconds), a unit duration, the action with its parameters, and the key state change.

1) t=0s, dur=1
   wretched object_5 object_10 object_11 object_3
   Effect: replace next(object_5, object_10) with next(object_5, object_11).

2) t=1s, dur=1
   clip object_12 object_5 object_11
   Effect: add vase(object_12, object_5); remove next(object_12, object_11).

3) t=2s, dur=1
   wretched object_5 object_11 object_10 object_3

4) t=3s, dur=1
   tightfisted object_12 object_5 object_10
   Effect: add next(object_12, object_10); remove vase(object_12, object_5).
   Note: Goal achieved — next(object_12, object_10).
