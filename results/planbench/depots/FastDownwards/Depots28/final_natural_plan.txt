Below is a clear, step-by-step, human-readable execution of the given PDDL plan. Each step matches the plan exactly (no steps added or removed). For each action I show: a timestamp (1.0 time unit per step), the action with its parameters, the formal preconditions and effects (translated from the domain), and a short plain-English description of what the step does and which facts change.

Step 0 — t = 0.0 → 1.0
Action: clip(object_13, object_4, object_7)
- Preconditions (required now): (hand object_13), (sneeze object_4), (texture object_7), (next object_4 object_7), (next object_13 object_7)
- Effects: add (vase object_13 object_4); delete (next object_13 object_7)
- Plain English: Using object_13 (which is in hand) on object_4 (which can sneeze) and object_7 (has the needed texture). This creates a vase relation between object_13 and object_4 and removes the link next(object_13, object_7).

Step 1 — t = 1.0 → 2.0
Action: sip(object_13, object_0, object_6)
- Preconditions: (hand object_13), (cats object_0), (texture object_6), (next object_13 object_6), (next object_0 object_6)
- Effects: add (vase object_13 object_0); delete (next object_13 object_6)
- Plain English: With object_13 in hand and object_0 being a “cats” object, and both object_13 and object_0 linked to object_6, create vase(object_13, object_0) and remove the next link from object_13 to object_6.

Step 2 — t = 2.0 → 3.0
Action: memory(object_0, object_6, object_5)
- Preconditions: (cats object_0), (spring object_6), (spring object_5), (next object_0 object_6)
- Effects: add (next object_0 object_5); delete (next object_0 object_6)
- Plain English: Move the “next” pointer for object_0 from object_6 to object_5 (object_6 and object_5 are springs; object_0 is cats). After this, next(object_0,object_5) holds and next(object_0,object_6) is removed.

Step 3 — t = 3.0 → 4.0
Action: paltry(object_13, object_0, object_5)
- Preconditions: (hand object_13), (cats object_0), (texture object_5), (vase object_13 object_0), (next object_0 object_5)
- Effects: add (next object_13 object_5); delete (vase object_13 object_0)
- Plain English: Using the vase relation just created between object_13 and object_0 and the next link (object_0 -> object_5), establish next(object_13,object_5) and remove the vase(object_13,object_0) relation.

Step 4 — t = 4.0 → 5.0
Action: sip(object_12, object_0, object_5)
- Preconditions: (hand object_12), (cats object_0), (texture object_5), (next object_12 object_5), (next object_0 object_5)
- Effects: add (vase object_12 object_0); delete (next object_12 object_5)
- Plain English: With object_12 in hand and object_0 linked to object_5, create vase(object_12,object_0) and remove next(object_12,object_5).

Step 5 — t = 5.0 → 6.0
Action: paltry(object_12, object_0, object_8)
- Preconditions: (hand object_12), (cats object_0), (texture object_8), (vase object_12 object_0), (next object_0 object_8)
- Effects: add (next object_12 object_8); delete (vase object_12 object_0)
- Plain English: Using vase(object_12,object_0) and the existing next(object_0,object_8), set next(object_12,object_8) and remove the vase relation between object_12 and object_0.

Step 6 — t = 6.0 → 7.0
Action: wretched(object_4, object_9, object_11, object_3)
- Preconditions: (sneeze object_4), (texture object_9), (texture object_11), (stupendous object_3), (next object_4 object_9), (collect object_9 object_3), (collect object_11 object_3)
- Effects: add (next object_4 object_11); delete (next object_4 object_9)
- Plain English: For object_4 (sneeze) move its next pointer from object_9 to object_11, given that object_9 and object_11 are textured and both are collected for stupendous object_3. Result: next(object_4,object_11) instead of next(object_4,object_9).

Step 7 — t = 7.0 → 8.0
Action: clip(object_12, object_4, object_11)
- Preconditions: (hand object_12), (sneeze object_4), (texture object_11), (next object_4 object_11), (next object_12 object_11)
- Effects: add (vase object_12 object_4); delete (next object_12 object_11)
- Plain English: Using object_12 (in hand) with sneeze object_4 and textured object_11, create vase(object_12,object_4) and remove next(object_12,object_11).

Step 8 — t = 8.0 → 9.0
Action: wretched(object_4, object_11, object_10, object_3)
- Preconditions: (sneeze object_4), (texture object_11), (texture object_10), (stupendous object_3), (next object_4 object_11), (collect object_11 object_3), (collect object_10 object_3)
- Effects: add (next object_4 object_10); delete (next object_4 object_11)
- Plain English: Shift next(object_4, ...) from object_11 to object_10 (wretched uses collection relations for stupendous object_3). After this step next(object_4,object_10) holds.

Step 9 — t = 9.0 → 10.0
Action: tightfisted(object_13, object_4, object_10)
- Preconditions: (hand object_13), (sneeze object_4), (texture object_10), (next object_4 object_10), (vase object_13 object_4)
- Effects: add (next object_13 object_10); delete (vase object_13 object_4)
- Plain English: With vase(object_13,object_4) and next(object_4,object_10), create next(object_13,object_10) and remove vase(object_13,object_4).

Step 10 — t = 10.0 → 11.0
Action: tightfisted(object_12, object_4, object_10)
- Preconditions: (hand object_12), (sneeze object_4), (texture object_10), (next object_4 object_10), (vase object_12 object_4)
- Effects: add (next object_12 object_10); delete (vase object_12 object_4)
- Plain English: Using vase(object_12,object_4) and next(object_4,object_10), set next(object_12,object_10) and delete vase(object_12,object_4).

Step 11 — t = 11.0 → 12.0
Action: clip(object_11, object_4, object_10)
- Preconditions: (hand object_11), (sneeze object_4), (texture object_10), (next object_4 object_10), (next object_11 object_10)
- Effects: add (vase object_11 object_4); delete (next object_11 object_10)
- Plain English: Using object_11 in hand with sneeze object_4 and textured object_10 yields vase(object_11,object_4) and removes next(object_11,object_10).

Step 12 — t = 12.0 → 13.0
Action: wretched(object_4, object_10, object_9, object_2)
- Preconditions: (sneeze object_4), (texture object_10), (texture object_9), (stupendous object_2), (next object_4 object_10), (collect object_10 object_2), (collect object_9 object_2)
- Effects: add (next object_4 object_9); delete (next object_4 object_10)
- Plain English: Move next(object_4,...) from object_10 to object_9 because both object_10 and object_9 are collected for stupendous object_2. After this, next(object_4,object_9) holds.

Step 13 — t = 13.0 → 14.0
Action: tightfisted(object_11, object_4, object_9)
- Preconditions: (hand object_11), (sneeze object_4), (texture object_9), (next object_4 object_9), (vase object_11 object_4)
- Effects: add (next object_11 object_9); delete (vase object_11 object_4)
- Plain English: With vase(object_11,object_4) and next(object_4,object_9), set next(object_11,object_9) and remove vase(object_11,object_4).

Step 14 — t = 14.0 → 15.0
Action: wretched(object_4, object_9, object_8, object_2)
- Preconditions: (sneeze object_4), (texture object_9), (texture object_8), (stupendous object_2), (next object_4 object_9), (collect object_9 object_2), (collect object_8 object_2)
- Effects: add (next object_4 object_8); delete (next object_4 object_9)
- Plain English: Move next for object_4 from object_9 to object_8 (using collect relationships tied to stupendous object_2). After this, next(object_4,object_8) holds.

Step 15 — t = 15.0 → 16.0
Action: clip(object_14, object_4, object_8)
- Preconditions: (hand object_14), (sneeze object_4), (texture object_8), (next object_4 object_8), (next object_14 object_8)
- Effects: add (vase object_14 object_4); delete (next object_14 object_8)
- Plain English: Create vase(object_14,object_4) and remove next(object_14,object_8), using object_14 in hand with object_4 and object_8.

Step 16 — t = 16.0 → 17.0
Action: tightfisted(object_14, object_4, object_7)
- Preconditions: (hand object_14), (sneeze object_4), (texture object_7), (next object_4 object_7), (vase object_14 object_4)
- Effects: add (next object_14 object_7); delete (vase object_14 object_4)
- Plain English: Using the vase relation just created between object_14 and object_4 and the link next(object_4,object_7), set next(object_14,object_7) and remove vase(object_14,object_4).

Remarks / Outcome:
- The sequence above follows the provided plan exactly (17 actions, same order, same parameters).
- Each step applied domain-defined preconditions and effects. The plan is executable because every precondition at each step is satisfied either by the problem initialization or by effects of earlier steps in this sequence.
- Timestamps are given as discrete 1.0-unit steps for readability; each action is shown occupying one time unit. Total makespan: 17.0 time units.
