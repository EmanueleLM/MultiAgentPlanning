- Achieved: next(object_13, object_5) and next(object_13, object_10) (both established during the sequence)
- Achieved: next(object_14, object_7)
- Achieved: next(object_11, object_10) and next(object_12, object_6) (established earlier in the plan)
- Note: The full goal set in the PDDL problem is the conjunction of those next(...) facts. After executing the above 23 ordered steps, all required goal next(...) facts are satisfied.

Execution notes
- Each action step is listed in the exact order provided by the plan and none were added or removed.
- Each step assumes the stated preconditions are met at the time of execution (as required by the domain schema). The effects listed are exactly those specified by the domain for each action.
- Time is shown as unit intervals for readability; durations are assumed uniform (1.0 time unit per action) for this trace.
