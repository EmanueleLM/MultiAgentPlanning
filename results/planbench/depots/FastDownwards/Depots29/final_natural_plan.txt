Here is the human-readable sequence of actions that follows the provided plan exactly. Each step uses unit duration and sequential timestamps.

- t=00, duration 1: wretched(object_4, object_10, object_8, object_2)
- t=01, duration 1: wretched(object_3, object_5, object_6, object_1)
- t=02, duration 1: clip(object_13, object_3, object_6)
- t=03, duration 1: clip(object_11, object_3, object_6)
- t=04, duration 1: sip(object_12, object_0, object_8)
- t=05, duration 1: memory(object_0, object_8, object_5)
- t=06, duration 1: paltry(object_12, object_0, object_5)
- t=07, duration 1: wretched(object_3, object_6, object_5, object_1)
- t=08, duration 1: clip(object_14, object_3, object_5)
- t=09, duration 1: tightfisted(object_13, object_3, object_5)
- t=10, duration 1: clip(object_12, object_3, object_5)
- t=11, duration 1: tightfisted(object_11, object_3, object_5)
