- Step 1 (t=0 to t=1): clip object_9 object_4 object_7
  - Effects: add vase object_9 object_4; delete next object_9 object_7.

- Step 2 (t=1 to t=2): wretched object_4 object_7 object_8 object_2

- Step 3 (t=2 to t=3): tightfisted object_9 object_4 object_8
  - Effects: add next object_9 object_8; delete vase object_9 object_4.
