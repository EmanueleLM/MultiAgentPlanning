This logistics plan details the required steps to move `crate1` onto `pallet1` (at `depot1`) and `crate2` onto `pallet2` (at `depot2`), starting from the initial stacked position at `distributor0`.

### Execution Plan (13 Steps)

| Step | Action | Location(s) | Details |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 1 | **Drive Empty** | `depot0` to `depot2` | Truck `truck0` moves empty from `depot0` to `depot2`. |
| 2 | **Drive Empty** | `depot2` to `distributor0` | Truck `truck0` moves empty from `depot2` to `distributor0`. (Ready to collect `crate2`) |
| 3 | **Lift** | `distributor0` | Hoist `hoist3` lifts `crate2` off of `crate1`. (`crate2` is now held by `hoist3`). |
| 4 | **Load** | `distributor0` | Hoist `hoist3` loads the lifted `crate2` onto truck `truck0`. |
| 5 | **Drive Cargo** | `distributor0` to `depot2` | Truck `truck0` drives, carrying `crate2`, from `distributor0` to `depot2`. |
| 6 | **Drive Empty** | `depot1` to `distributor0` | Truck `truck2` moves empty from `depot1` to `distributor0`. (Ready to collect `crate1`) |
| 7 | **Unload** | `depot2` | Hoist `hoist2` unloads `crate2` from truck `truck0`. (`crate2` is now held by `hoist2`). |
| 8 | **Drop** | `depot2` | Hoist `hoist2` drops the lifted `crate2` onto `pallet2`. **(Goal: crate2 on pallet2 Achieved)** |
| 9 | **Lift** | `distributor0` | Hoist `hoist3` lifts `crate1` off of `crate0`. (`crate1` is now held by `hoist3`). |
| 10 | **Load** | `distributor0` | Hoist `hoist3` loads the lifted `crate1` onto truck `truck2`. |
| 11 | **Drive Cargo** | `distributor0` to `depot1` | Truck `truck2` drives, carrying `crate1`, from `distributor0` to `depot1`. |
| 12 | **Unload** | `depot1` | Hoist `hoist1` unloads `crate1` from truck `truck2`. (`crate1` is now held by `hoist1`). |
| 13 | **Drop** | `depot1` | Hoist `hoist1` drops the lifted `crate1` onto `pallet1`. **(Goal: crate1 on pallet1 Achieved)** |
