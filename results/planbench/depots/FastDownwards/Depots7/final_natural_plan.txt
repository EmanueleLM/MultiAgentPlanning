Here is the human-readable sequence of actions following the given plan exactly. Timestamps use unit steps (duration = 1):

1) t=0, duration=1 — clip object_9 object_4 object_8
   - Effect: establishes vase(object_9, object_4) and removes next(object_9, object_8).

2) t=1, duration=1 — wretched object_4 object_8 object_7 object_2
   - Effect: redirects next for object_4 from object_8 to object_7 (adds next(object_4, object_7), deletes next(object_4, object_8)).

3) t=2, duration=1 — tightfisted object_9 object_4 object_7
   - Effect: sets next(object_9, object_7) and removes vase(object_9, object_4).

Goal status at end:
- next(object_10, object_5) remains true from the initial state.
- next(object_9, object_7) achieved at t=2.
Both goal conditions are satisfied.
