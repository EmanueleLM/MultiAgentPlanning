Summary of the relevant initial facts (as used to verify the plan)
- Hands: hand(object_9), hand(object_10)
- Sneezes: sneeze(object_3), sneeze(object_4)
- Textures: texture(object_5), texture(object_6), texture(object_7), texture(object_8)
- Stupendous: stupendous(object_1), stupendous(object_2)
- Collect relations: collect(object_5, object_1), collect(object_6, object_1), collect(object_7, object_2), collect(object_8, object_2)
- Next relations: next(object_0,object_7), next(object_0,object_5), next(object_10,object_5), next(object_3,object_5), next(object_4,object_8), next(object_9,object_8), next(object_9,object_5)
- No vase facts present initially.

All preconditions referenced below are taken from the provided action signatures in the domain/public information.

Plan (5 steps). Each step shown with a timestamp (assume unit time per step), preconditions checked, effects applied, and any missing facts noted.

Step 1 — time t=0s
Action: clip object_9 object_3 object_5
- Formal: clip(X=object_9, Y=object_3, Z=object_5)
- Preconditions required: hand(object_9), sneeze(object_3), texture(object_5), next(object_3,object_5), next(object_9,object_5)
- Are they satisfied in the initial state? Yes — all are present.
- Effects (applied): add vase(object_9,object_3); delete next(object_9,object_5)
- Resulting local changes after Step 1:
  - Added: (vase object_9 object_3)
  - Removed: (next object_9 object_5)
- Missing facts needed to verify applicability: none (all preconditions present).

Step 2 — time t=1s
Action: clip object_10 object_3 object_5
- Formal: clip(X=object_10, Y=object_3, Z=object_5)
- Preconditions required: hand(object_10), sneeze(object_3), texture(object_5), next(object_3,object_5), next(object_10,object_5)
- Are they satisfied? Yes — all are present at this point (note next(object_3,object_5) was not removed by Step 1).
- Effects (applied): add vase(object_10,object_3); delete next(object_10,object_5)
- Resulting local changes after Step 2:
  - Added: (vase object_10 object_3)
  - Removed: (next object_10 object_5)
- Missing facts needed to verify applicability: none.

Step 3 — time t=2s
Action: wretched object_3 object_5 object_6 object_1
- Formal: wretched(A=object_3, B=object_5, C=object_6, D=object_1)
- Preconditions required: sneeze(object_3), texture(object_5), texture(object_6), stupendous(object_1), next(object_3,object_5), collect(object_5,object_1), collect(object_6,object_1)
- Are they satisfied? Yes — all preconditions are present. (next(object_3,object_5) remained until this step.)
- Effects (applied): add next(object_3,object_6); delete next(object_3,object_5)
- Resulting local changes after Step 3:
  - Added: (next object_3 object_6)
  - Removed: (next object_3 object_5)
- Missing facts needed to verify applicability: none.

Step 4 — time t=3s
Action: tightfisted object_9 object_3 object_6
- Formal: tightfisted(X=object_9, Y=object_3, Z=object_6)
- Preconditions required: hand(object_9), sneeze(object_3), texture(object_6), next(object_3,object_6), vase(object_9,object_3)
- Are they satisfied? Yes —
  - hand(object_9) was true initially,
  - sneeze(object_3) true,
  - texture(object_6) true,
  - next(object_3,object_6) was added by Step 3,
  - vase(object_9,object_3) was added by Step 1.
- Effects (applied): add next(object_9,object_6); delete vase(object_9,object_3)
- Resulting local changes after Step 4:
  - Added: (next object_9 object_6)
  - Removed: (vase object_9 object_3)
- Missing facts needed to verify applicability: none.

Step 5 — time t=4s
Action: tightfisted object_10 object_3 object_6
- Formal: tightfisted(X=object_10, Y=object_3, Z=object_6)
- Preconditions required: hand(object_10), sneeze(object_3), texture(object_6), next(object_3,object_6), vase(object_10,object_3)
- Are they satisfied? Yes —
  - hand(object_10) was true initially,
  - sneeze(object_3) true,
  - texture(object_6) true,
  - next(object_3,object_6) exists (from Step 3),
  - vase(object_10,object_3) exists (from Step 2).
- Effects (applied): add next(object_10,object_6); delete vase(object_10,object_3)
- Resulting local changes after Step 5:
  - Added: (next object_10 object_6)
  - Removed: (vase object_10 object_3)
- Missing facts needed to verify applicability: none.

Final state relevant to the goal (after all steps)
- next(object_10,object_6) — achieved in Step 5
- next(object_9,object_6) — achieved in Step 4
- Therefore the goal (next object_10 object_6) AND (next object_9 object_6) is satisfied.

Overall verification notes
- Every action in the provided plan is applicable when executed in the given order: all preconditions for each action are present at the moment the action is executed.
- No additional facts were required or missing to verify applicability of any action.
- The specified effects of each action produce the two goal facts by the end of the sequence.
- Actions are STRIPS-style instantaneous steps; timestamps above are illustrative (1 unit per step) to show order and timing.

This sequence reproduces the provided plan exactly and confirms it is compliant with the domain, the problem initial state, and achieves the stated goal.
