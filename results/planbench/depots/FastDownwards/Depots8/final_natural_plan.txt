Human-readable action sequence (timestamps assume unit duration per action)

1) t=0 -> t=1: clip object_9 object_4 object_8
   - Preconditions: hand(object_9), sneeze(object_4), texture(object_8), next(object_4, object_8), next(object_9, object_8)
   - Effects: vase(object_9, object_4); not next(object_9, object_8)

2) t=1 -> t=2: wretched object_4 object_8 object_7 object_2
   - Preconditions: sneeze(object_4), texture(object_8), texture(object_7), stupendous(object_2), next(object_4, object_8), collect(object_8, object_2), collect(object_7, object_2)
   - Effects: next(object_4, object_7); not next(object_4, object_8)

3) t=2 -> t=3: tightfisted object_9 object_4 object_7
   - Preconditions: hand(object_9), sneeze(object_4), texture(object_7), next(object_4, object_7), vase(object_9, object_4)
   - Effects: next(object_9, object_7); not vase(object_9, object_4)

Final state note: next(object_10, object_5) remains true throughout; next(object_9, object_7) is achieved. Goal satisfied.
