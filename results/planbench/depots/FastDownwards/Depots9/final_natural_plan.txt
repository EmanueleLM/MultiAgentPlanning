Here is the human-readable sequence of actions following the given plan, with timestamps and brief effects.

- t=0 to 1 (duration 1): Perform CLIP(hand=object_9, sneezer=object_3, texture=object_5).
  Result: establish vase(object_9, object_3); remove next(object_9, object_5).

- t=1 to 2 (duration 1): Perform CLIP(hand=object_10, sneezer=object_3, texture=object_5).
  Result: establish vase(object_10, object_3); remove next(object_10, object_5).

- t=2 to 3 (duration 1): Perform WRETCHED(sneezer=object_3, from_texture=object_5, to_texture=object_6, group=object_1).
  Result: move sneezer link next(object_3, •) from object_5 to object_6 (add next(object_3, object_6); delete next(object_3, object_5)).

- t=3 to 4 (duration 1): Perform TIGHTFISTED(hand=object_9, sneezer=object_3, texture=object_6).
  Result: add next(object_9, object_6); remove vase(object_9, object_3).

- t=4 to 5 (duration 1): Perform TIGHTFISTED(hand=object_10, sneezer=object_3, texture=object_6).
  Result: add next(object_10, object_6); remove vase(object_10, object_3).

Final outcome: next(object_9, object_6) and next(object_10, object_6) are true, satisfying the goal.
