    "response": "Summary: The plan memory(o1,o6,o7) \u2192 sip(o8,o1,o7) \u2192 memory(o1,o7,o6) \u2192 paltry(o8,o1,o6) is valid for the first initial state and achieves the goal next object_8 object_6. The same plan is not valid for the second initial state: it fails at the first step because memory(o1,o6,o7) requires next object_1 object_6 which is not present there. Below are the checks and a corrected plan for the second state.\n\n1) First initial state (with next object_0 object_6 and next object_1 object_6)\n- Step 1: memory(o1,o6,o7)\n  - Preconditions: cats o1 (yes), spring o6 (yes), spring o7 (yes), next o1 o6 (yes).\n  - Effects: add next o1 o7; delete next o1 o6.\n- Step 2: sip(o8,o1,o7)\n  - Preconditions: hand o8 (yes), cats o1 (yes), texture o7 (yes), next o8 o7 (yes), next o1 o7 (added in step 1).\n  - Effects: add vase o8 o1; delete next o8 o7.\n- Step 3: memory(o1,o7,o6)\n  - Preconditions: cats o1 (yes), spring o7 (yes), spring o6 (yes), next o1 o7 (present from step 1).\n  - Effects: add next o1 o6; delete next o1 o7.\n- Step 4: paltry(o8,o1,o6)\n  - Preconditions: hand o8 (yes), cats o1 (yes), texture o6 (yes), vase o8 o1 (added in step 2), next o1 o6 (added in step 3).\n  - Effects: add next o8 o6; delete vase o8 o1.\n- Result: next object_8 object_6 is added \u2014 goal achieved.\n\n2) Second initial state (with next object_0 object_7 and next object_1 object_7)\n- Step 1 proposed: memory(o1,o6,o7)\n  - Preconditions include next o1 o6, but next o1 o6 is not present in this initial state (only next o1 o7 is present). So the first action is not applicable and the plan fails immediately.\n\nCorrected plan for the second initial state\n- A minimal working reorder is:\n  1. sip object_8 object_1 object_7\n     - Preconditions: hand o8, cats o1, texture o7, next o8 o7, next o1 o7 \u2014 all true initially.\n     - Effects: add vase o8 o1; delete next o8 o7.\n  2. memory object_1 object_7 object_6\n     - Preconditions: cats o1, spring o7, spring o6, next o1 o7 \u2014 next o1 o7 is still true (sip does not delete it).\n     - Effects: add next o1 o6; delete next o1 o7.\n  3. paltry object_8 object_1 object_6\n     - Preconditions: hand o8, cats o1, texture o6, vase o8 o1 (from step 1), next o1 o6 (from step 2).\n     - Effects: add next o8 o6; delete vase o8 o1.\n- Result: next object_8 object_6 is produced and the goal is achieved.\n\nIf you want, I can (a) produce the full explicit state after each action for either scenario, or (b) search for other alternative plans."
