NATURAL-PLAN sas_plan_1
------------------------------
Assumptions: unit-cost actions take 1 time unit each; timestamps are cumulative.

- Step 1 (t=0→1, duration 1): Execute sip(object_8, object_1, object_7).
  Preconditions (met): hand(object_8), cats(object_1), texture(object_7), next(object_8, object_7), next(object_1, object_7).
  Effect: add vase(object_8, object_1); delete next(object_8, object_7).

- Step 2 (t=1→2, duration 1): Execute memory(object_1, object_7, object_6).
  Preconditions (met): cats(object_1), spring(object_7), spring(object_6), next(object_1, object_7).
  Effect: add next(object_1, object_6); delete next(object_1, object_7).

- Step 3 (t=2→3, duration 1): Execute paltry(object_8, object_1, object_6).
  Preconditions (met): hand(object_8), cats(object_1), texture(object_6), vase(object_8, object_1), next(object_1, object_6).
  Effect: add next(object_8, object_6); delete vase(object_8, object_1).

Result: Goal achieved — next(object_8, object_6) holds.
