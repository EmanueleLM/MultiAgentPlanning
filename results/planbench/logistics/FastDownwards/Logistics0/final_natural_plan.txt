This is the sequence of human-readable actions required to transport `package_0` to its destination, `location_0_0`.

The plan utilizes the air transport infrastructure managed by the Air Transport Planner.

| Step | Action Description | Location/Vehicle |
| :---: | :--- | :--- |
| **1** | Load `package_0` onto `airplane_1`. | At `location_1_0` (Airport in City 1). |
| **2** | Fly `airplane_1` (carrying `package_0`) from City 1 to City 0. | From `location_1_0` to `location_0_0`. |
| **3** | Unload `package_0` from `airplane_1`. | At `location_0_0` (Airport in City 0). |

**Goal achieved:** `package_0` is now at `location_0_0`.
