Here is the human-readable sequence of actions that follows the given plan exactly. Each step is sequential with duration 1 time unit.

1) t=0.0–1.0 (dur=1): wretched(object_4, object_7, object_8, object_2)
- Re-route sneezer object_4’s adjacency from texture object_7 to texture object_8 (under stupendous object_2).

2) t=1.0–2.0 (dur=1): clip(object_9, object_4, object_8)
- At texture object_8, bind hand object_9 to sneezer object_4 by creating vase(9,4); relinquish next(9,8).

3) t=2.0–3.0 (dur=1): sip(object_11, object_0, object_5)
- At texture object_5, bind hand object_11 to cat object_0 by creating vase(11,0); relinquish next(11,5).

4) t=3.0–4.0 (dur=1): sip(object_10, object_0, object_5)
- At texture object_5, bind hand object_10 to cat object_0 by creating vase(10,0); relinquish next(10,5).

5) t=4.0–5.0 (dur=1): wretched(object_4, object_8, object_7, object_2)
- Re-route sneezer object_4’s adjacency back from texture object_8 to texture object_7 (under stupendous object_2).

6) t=5.0–6.0 (dur=1): tightfisted(object_9, object_4, object_7)
- Consume vase(9,4) to establish next(9,7) at texture object_7.

7) t=6.0–7.0 (dur=1): wretched(object_3, object_6, object_5, object_1)
- Re-route sneezer object_3’s adjacency from texture object_6 to texture object_5 (under stupendous object_1).

8) t=7.0–8.0 (dur=1): memory(object_0, object_5, object_7)
- Move cat object_0’s adjacency from spring object_5 to spring object_7.

9) t=8.0–9.0 (dur=1): sip(object_9, object_0, object_7)
- At texture object_7, bind hand object_9 to cat object_0 by creating vase(9,0); relinquish next(9,7).

10) t=9.0–10.0 (dur=1): paltry(object_11, object_0, object_7)
- Use vase(11,0) to establish next(11,7); remove vase(11,0).

11) t=10.0–11.0 (dur=1): paltry(object_10, object_0, object_7)
- Use vase(10,0) to establish next(10,7); remove vase(10,0).

12) t=11.0–12.0 (dur=1): clip(object_10, object_4, object_7)
- At texture object_7, bind hand object_10 to sneezer object_4 by creating vase(10,4); relinquish next(10,7).

13) t=12.0–13.0 (dur=1): wretched(object_4, object_7, object_8, object_2)
- Re-route sneezer object_4’s adjacency from texture object_7 to texture object_8 (under stupendous object_2).

14) t=13.0–14.0 (dur=1): tightfisted(object_10, object_4, object_8)
- Consume vase(10,4) to establish next(10,8) at texture object_8.

15) t=14.0–15.0 (dur=1): memory(object_0, object_7, object_5)
- Move cat object_0’s adjacency from spring object_7 back to spring object_5.

16) t=15.0–16.0 (dur=1): paltry(object_9, object_0, object_5)
- Use vase(9,0) to establish next(9,5); remove vase(9,0).

17) t=16.0–17.0 (dur=1): clip(object_9, object_3, object_5)
- At texture object_5, bind hand object_9 to sneezer object_3 by creating vase(9,3); relinquish next(9,5).

18) t=17.0–18.0 (dur=1): wretched(object_3, object_5, object_6, object_1)
- Re-route sneezer object_3’s adjacency from texture object_5 back to texture object_6 (under stupendous object_1).

19) t=18.0–19.0 (dur=1): tightfisted(object_9, object_3, object_6)
- Consume vase(9,3) to establish next(9,6) at texture object_6.

Final goal achieved:
- next(object_10, object_8)
- next(object_11, object_7)
- next(object_9, object_6)
