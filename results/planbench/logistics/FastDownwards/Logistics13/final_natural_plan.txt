Here is the human-readable sequence matching the given plan exactly. Each step has a timestamp t and unit duration dur=1.

1) t=0, dur=1: clip object_11 object_5 object_9
   - Effects: add vase(object_11, object_5); delete next(object_11, object_9)

2) t=1, dur=1: wretched object_5 object_9 object_8 object_3
   - Effects: add next(object_5, object_8); delete next(object_5, object_9)

3) t=2, dur=1: tightfisted object_11 object_5 object_8
   - Effects: add next(object_11, object_8); delete vase(object_11, object_5)

4) t=3, dur=1: clip object_12 object_4 object_6
   - Effects: add vase(object_12, object_4); delete next(object_12, object_6)

5) t=4, dur=1: sip object_11 object_0 object_8
   - Effects: add vase(object_11, object_0); delete next(object_11, object_8)

6) t=5, dur=1: sip object_10 object_0 object_8
   - Effects: add vase(object_10, object_0); delete next(object_10, object_8)

7) t=6, dur=1: memory object_0 object_8 object_6
   - Effects: add next(object_0, object_6); delete next(object_0, object_8)

8) t=7, dur=1: paltry object_11 object_0 object_6
   - Effects: add next(object_11, object_6); delete vase(object_11, object_0)

9) t=8, dur=1: clip object_11 object_4 object_6
   - Effects: add vase(object_11, object_4); delete next(object_11, object_6)

10) t=9, dur=1: paltry object_10 object_0 object_6
    - Effects: add next(object_10, object_6); delete vase(object_10, object_0)

11) t=10, dur=1: clip object_10 object_4 object_6
    - Effects: add vase(object_10, object_4); delete next(object_10, object_6)

12) t=11, dur=1: wretched object_4 object_6 object_7 object_2
    - Effects: add next(object_4, object_7); delete next(object_4, object_6)

13) t=12, dur=1: tightfisted object_12 object_4 object_7
    - Effects: add next(object_12, object_7); delete vase(object_12, object_4)

14) t=13, dur=1: tightfisted object_11 object_4 object_7
    - Effects: add next(object_11, object_7); delete vase(object_11, object_4)

15) t=14, dur=1: tightfisted object_10 object_4 object_7
    - Effects: add next(object_10, object_7); delete vase(object_10, object_4)

Result: Achieves the final goals next(object_10, object_7), next(object_11, object_7), and next(object_12, object_7).
