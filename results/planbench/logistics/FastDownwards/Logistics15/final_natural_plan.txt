Below is a step-by-step, human-readable trace of the provided PDDL plan. Each step matches exactly one action from the plan. I give a simple timestamp (1 time unit per step), a short plain-language description, the instantiated preconditions and effects (adds / deletes) according to the domain, and whether the preconditions are met in the predecessor state.

Final check (after t = 21.0)
- The goal predicates are present:
  - (next object_10 object_6) ← created at Step 15
  - (next object_11 object_7) ← created at Step 21
  - (next object_12 object_7) ← created at Step 20
  - (next object_9 object_6) ← created at Step 13
- All plan steps were applicable in sequence (preconditions were satisfied at each step) and the final goal is achieved.

If you want, I can produce the same sequence in a compact table, or emit only the concise action list with timestamps (no preconditions/effects), or explain any individual step in more depth.
