Sequential execution plan (unit-duration steps; start at t=0)

1. t=0, dur=1 — clip(object_9, object_4, object_8)
2. t=1, dur=1 — clip(object_11, object_4, object_8)
3. t=2, dur=1 — sip(object_12, object_0, object_5)
4. t=3, dur=1 — wretched(object_4, object_8, object_7, object_2)
5. t=4, dur=1 — tightfisted(object_9, object_4, object_7)
6. t=5, dur=1 — tightfisted(object_11, object_4, object_7)
7. t=6, dur=1 — clip(object_10, object_4, object_7)
8. t=7, dur=1 — wretched(object_3, object_6, object_5, object_1)
9. t=8, dur=1 — memory(object_0, object_5, object_7)
10. t=9, dur=1 — sip(object_9, object_0, object_7)
11. t=10, dur=1 — paltry(object_12, object_0, object_7)
12. t=11, dur=1 — clip(object_12, object_4, object_7)
13. t=12, dur=1 — wretched(object_4, object_7, object_8, object_2)
14. t=13, dur=1 — tightfisted(object_12, object_4, object_8)
15. t=14, dur=1 — tightfisted(object_10, object_4, object_8)
16. t=15, dur=1 — sip(object_11, object_0, object_7)
17. t=16, dur=1 — memory(object_0, object_7, object_5)
18. t=17, dur=1 — paltry(object_9, object_0, object_5)
19. t=18, dur=1 — paltry(object_11, object_0, object_5)
20. t=19, dur=1 — clip(object_11, object_3, object_5)
21. t=20, dur=1 — wretched(object_3, object_5, object_6, object_1)
22. t=21, dur=1 — tightfisted(object_11, object_3, object_6)

Outcome: This sequence achieves the goal facts next(object_10, object_8), next(object_11, object_6), next(object_12, object_8), and next(object_9, object_5).
