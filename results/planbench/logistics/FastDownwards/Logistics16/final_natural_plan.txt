Here is the exact action sequence from the plan, rendered as clear, human-readable steps. Each action has unit duration and starts at integer timestamps.

- t=0, dur=1: clip(object_12, object_5, object_9) — adds vase(object_12, object_5); deletes next(object_12, object_9)
- t=1, dur=1: clip(object_10, object_5, object_9) — adds vase(object_10, object_5); deletes next(object_10, object_9)
- t=2, dur=1: sip(object_13, object_1, object_6) — adds vase(object_13, object_1); deletes next(object_13, object_6)
- t=3, dur=1: wretched(object_4, object_7, object_6, object_2) — adds next(object_4, object_6); deletes next(object_4, object_7)
- t=4, dur=1: wretched(object_5, object_9, object_8, object_3) — adds next(object_5, object_8); deletes next(object_5, object_9)
