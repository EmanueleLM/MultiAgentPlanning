This sequence of actions, executed by the `orchestrator` integrating the plans from the `truck_planner` and `air_planner`, achieves the final logistics goal. Time is measured in abstract Time Units (TU), corresponding to the accumulated PDDL cost.

| Step | Agent | Action Description | Location / City | Time (TU) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 1 | truck\_planner | Load **package 1** onto **truck 1**. | location\_1\_1 (City 1) | 1 |
| 2 | truck\_planner | **Truck 1** drives from location\_1\_1 to location\_1\_0 (Airport). | City 1 | 1 (Total: 2) |
| 3 | truck\_planner | Unload **package 1** from **truck 1**. (Goal for package 1 achieved: L1\_0) | location\_1\_0 (Airport) | 1 (Total: 3) |
| 4 | truck\_planner | Load **package 0** onto **truck 0**. | location\_0\_1 (City 0) | 1 (Total: 4) |
| 5 | air\_planner | Load **package 2** onto **airplane 1**. | location\_1\_0 (City 1 Airport) | 1 (Total: 5) |
| 6 | air\_planner | **Airplane 1** flies from location\_1\_0 (City 1) to location\_0\_0 (City 0). | Inter-city | 10 (Total: 15) |
| 7 | truck\_planner | **Truck 0** drives from location\_0\_1 to location\_0\_0 (Airport), carrying package 0. | City 0 | 1 (Total: 16) |
| 8 | truck\_planner | Unload **package 0** from **truck 0**. (Goal for package 0 achieved: L0\_0) | location\_0\_0 (Airport) | 1 (Total: 17) |
| 9 | air\_planner | Unload **package 2** from **airplane 1**. | location\_0\_0 (City 0 Airport) | 1 (Total: 18) |
| 10 | truck\_planner | Load **package 2** onto **truck 0**. | location\_0\_0 (Airport) | 1 (Total: 19) |
| 11 | truck\_planner | **Truck 0** drives from location\_0\_0 (Airport) to location\_0\_1, carrying package 2. | City 0 | 1 (Total: 20) |
| 12 | truck\_planner | Unload **package 2** from **truck 0**. (Goal for package 2 achieved: L0\_1) | location\_0\_1 | 1 (Total: 21) |

The total accumulated cost for this plan is 21 Time Units. The global goal is now satisfied.
