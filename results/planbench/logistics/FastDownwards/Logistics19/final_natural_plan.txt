Here is the human-readable sequence of actions that follows the given plan exactly and achieves the goal (next object_11 object_9). Assume each action takes 1 time unit.

1) t=0..1 — wretched object_4 object_10 object_8 object_2
- Effect: Switches object_4’s adjacency from object_10 to object_8.
- State updates: add next(object_4, object_8); delete next(object_4, object_10).

2) t=1..2 — clip object_11 object_4 object_8
- Effect: At texture location object_8, bind object_11 (hand) with object_4 (sneeze).
- State updates: add vase(object_11, object_4); delete next(object_11, object_8).

3) t=2..3 — wretched object_4 object_8 object_9 object_2
- Effect: Switches object_4’s adjacency from object_8 to object_9.
- State updates: add next(object_4, object_9); delete next(object_4, object_8).

4) t=3..4 — tightfisted object_11 object_4 object_9
- Effect: Using the vase link and object_4’s position at object_9, move object_11 next to object_9.
- State updates: add next(object_11, object_9); delete vase(object_11, object_4).

Goal achieved: next(object_11, object_9).
