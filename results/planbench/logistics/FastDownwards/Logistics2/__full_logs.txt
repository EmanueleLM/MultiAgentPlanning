------------------------------
Assumptions: unit-cost actions take 1 time unit each; timestamps are cumulative.

- Step 1 (t=0→1, duration 1): Execute sip(object_8, object_1, object_7).
  Preconditions (met): hand(object_8), cats(object_1), texture(object_7), next(object_8, object_7), next(object_1, object_7).
  Effect: add vase(object_8, object_1); delete next(object_8, object_7).

- Step 2 (t=1→2, duration 1): Execute memory(object_1, object_7, object_6).
  Preconditions (met): cats(object_1), spring(object_7), spring(object_6), next(object_1, object_7).
  Effect: add next(object_1, object_6); delete next(object_1, object_7).

- Step 3 (t=2→3, duration 1): Execute paltry(object_8, object_1, object_6).
  Preconditions (met): hand(object_8), cats(object_1), texture(object_6), vase(object_8, object_1), next(object_1, object_6).
  Effect: add next(object_8, object_6); delete vase(object_8, object_1).

Result: Goal achieved — next(object_8, object_6) holds.

NATURAL-PLAN sas_plan_1
------------------------------
Here is the human-readable execution of the plan, matching the provided actions exactly and in order. Assume each step takes duration 1 time unit.

- Step 1 (T=0, dur=1): memory object_0 object_6 object_5
  - Description: Redirect object_0’s link from object_6 to object_5 (since object_0 is cats, and both object_6 and object_5 have spring).
  - Key effect: next(object_0, object_5) becomes true; next(object_0, object_6) is removed.

- Step 2 (T=1, dur=1): sip object_8 object_0 object_5
  - Description: At textured object_5, pair hand-held object_8 with cat object_0, creating vase(object_8, object_0), using their shared next to object_5.
  - Key effect: vase(object_8, object_0) becomes true; next(object_8, object_5) is removed.

- Step 3 (T=2, dur=1): memory object_0 object_5 object_6
  - Description: Redirect object_0’s link back from object_5 to object_6 (both have spring).
  - Key effect: next(object_0, object_6) becomes true; next(object_0, object_5) is removed.

- Step 4 (T=3, dur=1): paltry object_8 object_0 object_6
  - Description: Using the vase link to object_0 and the textured object_6, establish next(object_8, object_6) and release the vase.
  - Key effect: next(object_8, object_6) becomes true; vase(object_8, object_0) is removed.

Result: The goal is satisfied — next(object_7, object_6) remained true throughout, and next(object_8, object_6) is achieved at Step 4.

[STATEMENT]
As initial conditions I have that, cats object_0, collect object_5 object_1, collect object_6 object_2, hand object_7, hand object_8, next object_0 object_6, next object_3 object_5, next object_4 object_6, next object_7 object_6, next object_8 object_5, sneeze object_3, sneeze object_4, spring object_5, spring object_6, stupendous object_1, stupendous object_2, texture object_5 and texture object_6.
My goal is to have that next object_7 object_6 and next object_8 object_6.

My plan is as follows:

memory object_0 object_6 object_5
sip object_8 object_0 object_5
memory object_0 object_5 object_6
paltry object_8 object_0 object_6

FINAL-PLAN
------------------------------
I’m missing the crucial details needed to build the domain and Scenario B problem exactly as requested. Please provide:

- The original operator schemas for the six actions (paltry, sip, clip, wretched, memory, tightfisted): parameter lists, preconditions, and effects, using only the predicates cats, collect, hand, sneeze, spring, stupendous, texture, next, vase.
- The “public information for Scenario B”: the exact initial facts over objects object_0 through object_8 and the exact goal condition(s).
- Whether you expect typing (e.g., a single type like obj) or untyped objects.

Once you share these, I will return a single STRIPS PDDL domain (exactly those six actions, no extra predicates) and a matching solvable Scenario B problem, each enclosed in the requested tags.

NATURAL-PLAN sas_plan_1
------------------------------
Here is the human-readable execution of the given plan (unit-duration steps):

1) t=0–1: sip object_8 object_0 object_6
   - Add: vase(object_8, object_0)
   - Delete: next(object_8, object_6)

2) t=1–2: sip object_7 object_0 object_6
   - Add: vase(object_7, object_0)
   - Delete: next(object_7, object_6)

3) t=2–3: memory object_0 object_6 object_5
   - Add: next(object_0, object_5)
   - Delete: next(object_0, object_6)

4) t=3–4: paltry object_8 object_0 object_5
   - Add: next(object_8, object_5)
   - Delete: vase(object_8, object_0)

5) t=4–5: paltry object_7 object_0 object_5
   - Add: next(object_7, object_5)
   - Delete: vase(object_7, object_0)

Outcome: Goal achieved — next(object_7, object_5) and next(object_8, object_5). Total duration/cost: 5.
