Here is the human-readable execution of the given plan (unit-duration steps):

1) t=0–1: sip object_8 object_0 object_6
   - Add: vase(object_8, object_0)
   - Delete: next(object_8, object_6)

2) t=1–2: sip object_7 object_0 object_6
   - Add: vase(object_7, object_0)
   - Delete: next(object_7, object_6)

3) t=2–3: memory object_0 object_6 object_5
   - Add: next(object_0, object_5)
   - Delete: next(object_0, object_6)

4) t=3–4: paltry object_8 object_0 object_5
   - Add: next(object_8, object_5)
   - Delete: vase(object_8, object_0)

5) t=4–5: paltry object_7 object_0 object_5
   - Add: next(object_7, object_5)
   - Delete: vase(object_7, object_0)

Outcome: Goal achieved — next(object_7, object_5) and next(object_8, object_5). Total duration/cost: 5.
