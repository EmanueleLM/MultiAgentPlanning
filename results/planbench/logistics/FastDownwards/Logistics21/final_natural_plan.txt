This logistics plan details the movement of packages (package\_0, package\_1) across two cities (City 1, City 0) using local trucks (truck\_1, truck\_0) and an inter-city airplane (airplane\_0) to achieve the final goal: package\_0 at location\_0\_2 and package\_1 at location\_0\_0.

The time reported assumes one unit of time per standard operation (drive, load, unload) and 10 units for air travel.

| Time | Agent | Action Description | Current Status / Details |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **T=1** | City1\_Logistics | Truck 1 drives from **location 1\_0 (City 1 Airport)** to **location 1\_1** in City 1. | Truck 1 is now ready for the first pickup. |

| **T=3** | City1\_Logistics | Truck 1 drives from location 1\_1 back to **location 1\_0 (City 1 Airport)**. | Truck 1 (carrying P0) prepares for the next pickup. |
| **T=4** | City1\_Logistics | Truck 1 drives from location 1\_0 (Airport) to **location 1\_2** in City 1. | Truck 1 (carrying P0) arrives at P1's location. |
| **T=5** | City1\_Logistics | Load **package 1** onto Truck 1 at location 1\_2. | Both P0 and P1 are now on Truck 1. |
| **T=6** | City1\_Logistics | Truck 1 drives from location 1\_2 back to **location 1\_0 (City 1 Airport)**. | P0 and P1 are ready for air transport. |
| **T=7** | City1\_Logistics | Unload **package 1** from Truck 1 at location 1\_0 (City 1 Airport). | P1 is staged for the airplane. |
| **T=8** | City1\_Logistics | Unload **package 0** from Truck 1 at location 1\_0 (City 1 Airport). | P0 is staged for the airplane. |
| **T=9** | City0\_Logistics | Truck 0 drives from location 0\_1 to **location 0\_0 (City 0 Airport)** in City 0. | Truck 0 positions itself to receive the incoming packages. |
| **T=19** | Orchestrator | Airplane 0 flies from **location 0\_0 (City 0 Airport)** to **location 1\_0 (City 1 Airport)**. | Inter-city transfer initiated (10 units duration). |
| **T=20** | Orchestrator | Load **package 1** onto Airplane 0 at location 1\_0 (City 1 Airport). | Package 1 is onboard. |
| **T=21** | Orchestrator | Load **package 0** onto Airplane 0 at location 1\_0 (City 1 Airport). | Package 0 is onboard. |
| **T=31** | Orchestrator | Airplane 0 flies from **location 1\_0 (City 1 Airport)** to **location 0\_0 (City 0 Airport)**. | Packages are returning to City 0 (10 units duration). |
| **T=32** | Orchestrator | Unload **package 1** from Airplane 0 at location 0\_0 (City 0 Airport). | **GOAL FULFILLED (P1): Package 1 is at location 0\_0.** |
| **T=33** | Orchestrator | Unload **package 0** from Airplane 0 at location 0\_0 (City 0 Airport). | Package 0 is staged for final delivery. |
| **T=34** | City0\_Logistics | Load **package 0** onto Truck 0 at location 0\_0 (City 0 Airport). | Truck 0 begins final leg of delivery. |
| **T=35** | City0\_Logistics | Truck 0 drives from location 0\_0 (Airport) to **location 0\_2** in City 0. | Truck 0 (carrying P0) arrives at the destination. |
| **T=36** | City0\_Logistics | Unload **package 0** from Truck 0 at location 0\_2. | **GOAL FULFILLED (P0): Package 0 is at location 0\_2.** |
