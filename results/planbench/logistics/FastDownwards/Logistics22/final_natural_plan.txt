Here is the human-readable execution of the provided plan. Each action lists its parameters and a brief effect summary. All steps are sequential with unit duration.

1) t=0..1 — wretched(object_4, object_8, object_10, object_2)
   - Effect: replaces next(object_4, object_8) with next(object_4, object_10).

2) t=1..2 — clip(object_12, object_4, object_10)
   - Effect: adds vase(object_12, object_4); deletes next(object_12, object_10).

3) t=2..3 — wretched(object_4, object_10, object_8, object_2)
   - Effect: replaces next(object_4, object_10) with next(object_4, object_8).

4) t=3..4 — wretched(object_4, object_8, object_9, object_2)
   - Effect: replaces next(object_4, object_8) with next(object_4, object_9).

5) t=4..5 — clip(object_11, object_4, object_9)
   - Effect: adds vase(object_11, object_4); deletes next(object_11, object_9).

6) t=5..6 — wretched(object_4, object_9, object_8, object_2)
   - Effect: replaces next(object_4, object_9) with next(object_4, object_8).

7) t=6..7 — tightfisted(object_12, object_4, object_8)
   - Effect: adds next(object_12, object_8); deletes vase(object_12, object_4).

8) t=7..8 — tightfisted(object_11, object_4, object_8)
   - Effect: adds next(object_11, object_8); deletes vase(object_11, object_4).

9) t=8..9 — wretched(object_3, object_6, object_5, object_1)
   - Effect: replaces next(object_3, object_6) with next(object_3, object_5).

10) t=9..10 — memory(object_0, object_5, object_8)
    - Effect: replaces next(object_0, object_5) with next(object_0, object_8).

11) t=10..11 — sip(object_12, object_0, object_8)
    - Effect: adds vase(object_12, object_0); deletes next(object_12, object_8).

12) t=11..12 — sip(object_11, object_0, object_8)
    - Effect: adds vase(object_11, object_0); deletes next(object_11, object_8).

13) t=12..13 — memory(object_0, object_8, object_5)
    - Effect: replaces next(object_0, object_8) with next(object_0, object_5).

14) t=13..14 — paltry(object_12, object_0, object_5)
    - Effect: adds next(object_12, object_5); deletes vase(object_12, object_0).

15) t=14..15 — paltry(object_11, object_0, object_5)
    - Effect: adds next(object_11, object_5); deletes vase(object_11, object_0).

16) t=15..16 — clip(object_11, object_3, object_5)
    - Effect: adds vase(object_11, object_3); deletes next(object_11, object_5).

17) t=16..17 — wretched(object_3, object_5, object_7, object_1)
    - Effect: replaces next(object_3, object_5) with next(object_3, object_7).

18) t=17..18 — tightfisted(object_11, object_3, object_7)
    - Effect: adds next(object_11, object_7); deletes vase(object_11, object_3).

Goal achieved at t=18:
- next(object_12, object_5)
- next(object_11, object_7)
