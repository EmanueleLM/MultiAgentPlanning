This is a step-by-step translation of the logistics plan into natural language instructions, focusing on achieving the goals: Package 0 at location\_1\_1 and Package 1 at location\_1\_0.

### Logistics Plan Execution

| Step | Action | Details |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |

| 3 | **UNLOAD-TRUCK** | Unload `package_0` from `truck_1` at `location_1_1`. **(Package 0 Goal Achieved)** |

**Phase 2: Preparation of Package 1 for Air Travel (Intra-City 0)**

| Step | Action | Details |

| 5 | **DRIVE-TRUCK** | Drive `truck_0` from the airport (`location_0_0`) to the package pickup point, `location_0_1`, within `city_0`. |
| 6 | **LOAD-TRUCK** | Load `package_1` onto `truck_0` at `location_0_1`. |
| 7 | **DRIVE-TRUCK** | Drive `truck_0` (carrying `package_1`) from `location_0_1` back to the airport, `location_0_0`, within `city_0`. |
| 8 | **UNLOAD-TRUCK** | Unload `package_1` from `truck_0` at the airport, `location_0_0`. |

**Phase 3: Air Delivery of Package 1 (Inter-City)**
