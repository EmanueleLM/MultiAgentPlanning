This is the orchestrated plan for achieving the required logistics goals, translated from the PDDL output. Each step represents one unit of time/cost.

**Initial State Summary:**
*   **Goal:** Package 0 at location 1_0; Package 1 at location 1_0; Package 2 at location 1_2.
*   **Truck 1 (City 1):** At location 1_2. (P0 is also here).
*   **Truck 0 (City 0):** At location 0_2.
*   **Airplane 0:** At location 1_0 (City 1 Airport).
*   **Package 1:** At location 0_1 (in City 0).
*   **Package 2:** At location 1_1 (in City 1).
