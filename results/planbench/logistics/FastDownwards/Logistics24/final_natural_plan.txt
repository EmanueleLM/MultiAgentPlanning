Human-readable action sequence (Scenario A). Goal: achieve next(object_12 object_10) and next(object_13 object_9). Assumed unit duration per action.

1. [t=0..1] clip object_12 object_5 object_11 - Effects add: vase(object_12 object_5); del: next(object_12 object_11)
2. [t=1..2] wretched object_5 object_11 object_10 object_3 - Effects add: next(object_5 object_10); del: next(object_5 object_11)
3. [t=2..3] tightfisted object_12 object_5 object_10 - Effects add: next(object_12 object_10); del: vase(object_12 object_5)
4. [t=3..4] wretched object_4 object_8 object_6 object_2 - Effects add: next(object_4 object_6); del: next(object_4 object_8)
5. [t=4..5] wretched object_4 object_6 object_7 object_2 - Effects add: next(object_4 object_7); del: next(object_4 object_6)
6. [t=5..6] clip object_13 object_4 object_7 - Effects add: vase(object_13 object_4); del: next(object_13 object_7)
7. [t=6..7] wretched object_4 object_7 object_6 object_2 - Effects add: next(object_4 object_6); del: next(object_4 object_7)
8. [t=7..8] tightfisted object_13 object_4 object_6 - Effects add: next(object_13 object_6); del: vase(object_13 object_4)
9. [t=8..9] memory object_0 object_9 object_6 - Effects add: next(object_0 object_6); del: next(object_0 object_9)
10. [t=9..10] sip object_13 object_0 object_6 - Effects add: vase(object_13 object_0); del: next(object_13 object_6)
11. [t=10..11] memory object_0 object_6 object_9 - Effects add: next(object_0 object_9); del: next(object_0 object_6)
12. [t=11..12] paltry object_13 object_0 object_9 - Effects add: next(object_13 object_9); del: vase(object_13 object_0)

Result: both goal facts are satisfied by the end of t=12:
- next(object_12 object_10) achieved at step 3
- next(object_13 object_9) achieved at step 12
