Here is the human-readable execution of the provided plan. Each step takes 1 time unit; timestamps are shown as [start–end).

1. [0–1) wretched(object_3, object_6, object_7, object_1) — set next(object_3, object_7); remove next(object_3, object_6).
2. [1–2) clip(object_13, object_3, object_7) — add vase(object_13, object_3); remove next(object_13, object_7).
3. [2–3) clip(object_12, object_3, object_7) — add vase(object_12, object_3); remove next(object_12, object_7).
4. [3–4) wretched(object_3, object_7, object_5, object_1) — set next(object_3, object_5); remove next(object_3, object_7).
5. [4–5) tightfisted(object_13, object_3, object_5) — set next(object_13, object_5); remove vase(object_13, object_3).
6. [5–6) tightfisted(object_12, object_3, object_5) — set next(object_12, object_5); remove vase(object_12, object_3).
7. [6–7) memory(object_0, object_8, object_5) — set next(object_0, object_5); remove next(object_0, object_8).
8. [7–8) sip(object_13, object_0, object_5) — add vase(object_13, object_0); remove next(object_13, object_5).
9. [8–9) sip(object_12, object_0, object_5) — add vase(object_12, object_0); remove next(object_12, object_5).
10. [9–10) wretched(object_4, object_9, object_10, object_2) — set next(object_4, object_10); remove next(object_4, object_9).
11. [10–11) clip(object_11, object_4, object_10) — add vase(object_11, object_4); remove next(object_11, object_10).
12. [11–12) wretched(object_4, object_10, object_8, object_2) — set next(object_4, object_8); remove next(object_4, object_10).
13. [12–13) tightfisted(object_11, object_4, object_8) — set next(object_11, object_8); remove vase(object_11, object_4).
14. [13–14) memory(object_0, object_5, object_8) — set next(object_0, object_8); remove next(object_0, object_5).
15. [14–15) paltry(object_13, object_0, object_8) — set next(object_13, object_8); remove vase(object_13, object_0).
16. [15–16) clip(object_13, object_4, object_8) — add vase(object_13, object_4); remove next(object_13, object_8).
17. [16–17) paltry(object_12, object_0, object_8) — set next(object_12, object_8); remove vase(object_12, object_0).
18. [17–18) clip(object_12, object_4, object_8) — add vase(object_12, object_4); remove next(object_12, object_8).
19. [18–19) wretched(object_4, object_8, object_10, object_2) — set next(object_4, object_10); remove next(object_4, object_8).
20. [19–20) tightfisted(object_13, object_4, object_10) — set next(object_13, object_10); remove vase(object_13, object_4).
21. [20–21) wretched(object_4, object_10, object_9, object_2) — set next(object_4, object_9); remove next(object_4, object_10).
22. [21–22) tightfisted(object_12, object_4, object_9) — set next(object_12, object_9); remove vase(object_12, object_4).
23. [22–23) sip(object_11, object_0, object_8) — add vase(object_11, object_0); remove next(object_11, object_8).
24. [23–24) memory(object_0, object_8, object_5) — set next(object_0, object_5); remove next(object_0, object_8).
25. [24–25) paltry(object_11, object_0, object_5) — set next(object_11, object_5); remove vase(object_11, object_0).

Final goal satisfied:
- next(object_11, object_5)
- next(object_12, object_9)
- next(object_13, object_10)
