Goal to achieve: next object_11 object_9; next object_12 object_8; next object_13 object_5; next object_14 object_7.

Action sequence (each step has duration 1 time unit):
1. t=0–1: wretched object_4 object_9 object_10 object_2 — switch next(object_4,·) from object_9 to object_10.
2. t=1–2: clip object_11 object_4 object_10 — create vase(object_11, object_4) and remove next(object_11, object_10).
3. t=2–3: wretched object_4 object_10 object_8 object_2 — switch next(object_4,·) from object_10 to object_8.
4. t=3–4: wretched object_3 object_6 object_5 object_1 — switch next(object_3,·) from object_6 to object_5.
5. t=4–5: wretched object_4 object_8 object_9 object_2 — switch next(object_4,·) from object_8 to object_9.
6. t=5–6: clip object_14 object_4 object_9 — create vase(object_14, object_4) and remove next(object_14, object_9).
7. t=6–7: tightfisted object_11 object_4 object_9 — consume vase(object_11, object_4) to set next(object_11, object_9).
8. t=7–8: wretched object_4 object_9 object_8 object_2 — switch next(object_4,·) from object_9 to object_8.
9. t=8–9: tightfisted object_14 object_4 object_8 — consume vase(object_14, object_4) to set next(object_14, object_8).
10. t=9–10: wretched object_3 object_5 object_7 object_1 — switch next(object_3,·) from object_5 to object_7.
11. t=10–11: clip object_13 object_3 object_7 — create vase(object_13, object_3) and remove next(object_13, object_7).
12. t=11–12: sip object_14 object_0 object_8 — create vase(object_14, object_0) and remove next(object_14, object_8).
13. t=12–13: wretched object_3 object_7 object_5 object_1 — switch next(object_3,·) from object_7 to object_5.
14. t=13–14: tightfisted object_13 object_3 object_5 — consume vase(object_13, object_3) to set next(object_13, object_5).
15. t=14–15: memory object_0 object_8 object_5 — move next(object_0,·) from object_8 to object_5.
16. t=15–16: paltry object_14 object_0 object_5 — consume vase(object_14, object_0) to set next(object_14, object_5).
17. t=16–17: clip object_14 object_3 object_5 — create vase(object_14, object_3) and remove next(object_14, object_5).
18. t=17–18: wretched object_3 object_5 object_7 object_1 — switch next(object_3,·) from object_5 to object_7.
19. t=18–19: tightfisted object_14 object_3 object_7 — consume vase(object_14, object_3) to set next(object_14, object_7).
20. t=19–20: sip object_12 object_0 object_5 — create vase(object_12, object_0) and remove next(object_12, object_5).
21. t=20–21: memory object_0 object_5 object_8 — move next(object_0,·) from object_5 to object_8.
22. t=21–22: paltry object_12 object_0 object_8 — consume vase(object_12, object_0) to set next(object_12, object_8).

Result at t=22: all goals satisfied — next object_11 object_9; next object_12 object_8; next object_13 object_5; next object_14 object_7. Total duration: 22 time units.
