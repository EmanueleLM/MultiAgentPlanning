Here is the human-readable sequence of actions matching the provided plan (unit-duration, sequential execution). Each step shows the timestamp, action with bound parameters, and its add/delete effects per the domain.

1. t=0, dur=1 — wretched(a=object_4, b=object_10, c=object_8, d=object_2) — add: next object_4 object_8; delete: next object_4 object_10
