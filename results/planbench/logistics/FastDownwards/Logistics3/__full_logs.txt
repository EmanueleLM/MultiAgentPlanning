------------------------------
Assumptions: unit-cost actions take 1 time unit each; timestamps are cumulative.

- Step 1 (t=0→1, duration 1): Execute sip(object_8, object_1, object_7).
  Preconditions (met): hand(object_8), cats(object_1), texture(object_7), next(object_8, object_7), next(object_1, object_7).
  Effect: add vase(object_8, object_1); delete next(object_8, object_7).

- Step 2 (t=1→2, duration 1): Execute memory(object_1, object_7, object_6).
  Preconditions (met): cats(object_1), spring(object_7), spring(object_6), next(object_1, object_7).
  Effect: add next(object_1, object_6); delete next(object_1, object_7).

- Step 3 (t=2→3, duration 1): Execute paltry(object_8, object_1, object_6).
  Preconditions (met): hand(object_8), cats(object_1), texture(object_6), vase(object_8, object_1), next(object_1, object_6).
  Effect: add next(object_8, object_6); delete vase(object_8, object_1).

Result: Goal achieved — next(object_8, object_6) holds.

NATURAL-PLAN sas_plan_1
------------------------------
Here is the human-readable execution of the plan, matching the provided actions exactly and in order. Assume each step takes duration 1 time unit.

- Step 1 (T=0, dur=1): memory object_0 object_6 object_5
  - Description: Redirect object_0’s link from object_6 to object_5 (since object_0 is cats, and both object_6 and object_5 have spring).
  - Key effect: next(object_0, object_5) becomes true; next(object_0, object_6) is removed.

- Step 2 (T=1, dur=1): sip object_8 object_0 object_5
  - Description: At textured object_5, pair hand-held object_8 with cat object_0, creating vase(object_8, object_0), using their shared next to object_5.
  - Key effect: vase(object_8, object_0) becomes true; next(object_8, object_5) is removed.

- Step 3 (T=2, dur=1): memory object_0 object_5 object_6
  - Description: Redirect object_0’s link back from object_5 to object_6 (both have spring).
  - Key effect: next(object_0, object_6) becomes true; next(object_0, object_5) is removed.

- Step 4 (T=3, dur=1): paltry object_8 object_0 object_6
  - Description: Using the vase link to object_0 and the textured object_6, establish next(object_8, object_6) and release the vase.
  - Key effect: next(object_8, object_6) becomes true; vase(object_8, object_0) is removed.

Result: The goal is satisfied — next(object_7, object_6) remained true throughout, and next(object_8, object_6) is achieved at Step 4.

[STATEMENT]
As initial conditions I have that, cats object_0, collect object_5 object_1, collect object_6 object_2, hand object_7, hand object_8, next object_0 object_6, next object_3 object_5, next object_4 object_6, next object_7 object_6, next object_8 object_5, sneeze object_3, sneeze object_4, spring object_5, spring object_6, stupendous object_1, stupendous object_2, texture object_5 and texture object_6.
My goal is to have that next object_7 object_6 and next object_8 object_6.

My plan is as follows:

memory object_0 object_6 object_5
sip object_8 object_0 object_5
memory object_0 object_5 object_6
paltry object_8 object_0 object_6

FINAL-PLAN
------------------------------
I’m missing the crucial details needed to build the domain and Scenario B problem exactly as requested. Please provide:

- The original operator schemas for the six actions (paltry, sip, clip, wretched, memory, tightfisted): parameter lists, preconditions, and effects, using only the predicates cats, collect, hand, sneeze, spring, stupendous, texture, next, vase.
- The “public information for Scenario B”: the exact initial facts over objects object_0 through object_8 and the exact goal condition(s).
- Whether you expect typing (e.g., a single type like obj) or untyped objects.

Once you share these, I will return a single STRIPS PDDL domain (exactly those six actions, no extra predicates) and a matching solvable Scenario B problem, each enclosed in the requested tags.

FINAL-PLAN
------------------------------
I’m missing critical details needed to produce a valid and exact PDDL domain and two problems. To ensure the operators “match the provided operator specs exactly” and that the problems encode the “initial states and goals as provided,” please supply the following:

- Predicate signatures (arity and argument roles) for:
  hand, cats, texture, sneeze, spring, stupendous, next, vase, collect
  Example format: hand(?x - obj), next(?x - obj ?y - obj), etc.

- Operator schemas for each action:
  paltry, sip, clip, wretched, memory, tightfisted
  For each: parameter list, preconditions (including any negative preconditions), and add/delete effects. Please ensure effects are ordinary STRIPS effects (no numeric fluents, no conditional effects, no temporals).

- Two problem instances (for scenario_a and scenario_b), each with:
  - Objects: confirm the set object_0 … object_9
  - Initial facts: full list of ground atoms over the above predicates
  - Goal facts: full list of ground atoms to be achieved
  - Any hard constraints derived from preferences (e.g., “avoid X” encoded as required negative goals or state constraints representable in STRIPS)

- Any intended static relations (e.g., is next a fixed successor relation over the objects?) that should never change via action effects.

Once you provide these specifics, I will return:
- <domain>…</domain> containing domain objects_play with only :strips, :typing (and :negative-preconditions if used), the exact predicates, and the six actions with the exact preconditions/effects.
- Two problems <problem>…</problem> named scenario_a and scenario_b, each fully grounded and ready for Fast Downward.

NATURAL-PLAN sas_plan_10
------------------------------
Here is the human-readable execution sequence that follows the given plan exactly and achieves the goals:

1. [t=0–1] (sip object_8 object_0 object_6) — Establish vase(object_8, object_0) and remove next(object_8, object_6).
2. [t=1–2] (sip object_7 object_0 object_6) — Establish vase(object_7, object_0) and remove next(object_7, object_6).
3. [t=2–3] (memory object_0 object_6 object_5) — Reroute next from next(object_0, object_6) to next(object_0, object_5).
4. [t=3–4] (paltry object_8 object_0 object_5) — Establish next(object_8, object_5) and remove vase(object_8, object_0).
5. [t=4–5] (paltry object_7 object_0 object_5) — Establish next(object_7, object_5) and remove vase(object_7, object_0).

Result: Goals satisfied — next(object_8, object_5) and next(object_7, object_5).
