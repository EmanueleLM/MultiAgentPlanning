Here is the human-readable execution sequence that follows the given plan exactly and achieves the goals:

1. [t=0–1] (sip object_8 object_0 object_6) — Establish vase(object_8, object_0) and remove next(object_8, object_6).
2. [t=1–2] (sip object_7 object_0 object_6) — Establish vase(object_7, object_0) and remove next(object_7, object_6).
3. [t=2–3] (memory object_0 object_6 object_5) — Reroute next from next(object_0, object_6) to next(object_0, object_5).
4. [t=3–4] (paltry object_8 object_0 object_5) — Establish next(object_8, object_5) and remove vase(object_8, object_0).
5. [t=4–5] (paltry object_7 object_0 object_5) — Establish next(object_7, object_5) and remove vase(object_7, object_0).

Result: Goals satisfied — next(object_8, object_5) and next(object_7, object_5).
