Here is the human-readable sequence of actions that follows the plan exactly and achieves the goal:

- t=0 → t=1 (duration 1): memory(object_1, object_6, object_7)
  - Reroute the next-link of object_1 from object_6 to object_7.
  - Preconditions used: cats(object_1), spring(object_6), spring(object_7), next(object_1, object_6).
  - Effects: remove next(object_1, object_6); add next(object_1, object_7).

- t=1 → t=2 (duration 1): sip(object_9, object_1, object_7)
  - Use the shared target object_7 to create a vase link between object_9 and object_1, consuming object_9’s link to object_7.
  - Preconditions used: hand(object_9), cats(object_1), texture(object_7), next(object_9, object_7), next(object_1, object_7).
  - Effects: remove next(object_9, object_7); add vase(object_9, object_1).

- t=2 → t=3 (duration 1): memory(object_1, object_7, object_6)
  - Restore the next-link of object_1 back from object_7 to object_6.
  - Preconditions used: cats(object_1), spring(object_7), spring(object_6), next(object_1, object_7).
  - Effects: remove next(object_1, object_7); add next(object_1, object_6).

- t=3 → t=4 (duration 1): paltry(object_9, object_1, object_6)
  - Consume the vase link to establish next(object_9, object_6).
  - Preconditions used: hand(object_9), cats(object_1), texture(object_6), vase(object_9, object_1), next(object_1, object_6).
  - Effects: add next(object_9, object_6); remove vase(object_9, object_1).

Final state: 
- next(object_8, object_7) remains true throughout.
- next(object_9, object_6) is achieved at t=4.
Goal satisfied. Total cost: 4; makespan: 4.
