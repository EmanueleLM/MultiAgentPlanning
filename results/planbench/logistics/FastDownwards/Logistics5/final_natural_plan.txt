Human-readable action sequence (timestamps in unit-time; each step duration = 1)

1) t=0, dur=1 — wretched(w=object_3, x=object_5, y=object_6, z=object_1)
   Redirect object_3’s next from object_5 to object_6 (adds next(object_3, object_6), removes next(object_3, object_5)).

2) t=1, dur=1 — clip(x=object_9, y=object_3, z=object_6)
   At location object_6, bind object_9 to object_3 by creating vase(object_9, object_3); remove next(object_9, object_6).

3) t=2, dur=1 — wretched(w=object_3, x=object_6, y=object_5, z=object_1)
   Redirect object_3’s next back from object_6 to object_5 (adds next(object_3, object_5), removes next(object_3, object_6)).

4) t=3, dur=1 — tightfisted(x=object_9, y=object_3, z=object_5)
   Using vase(object_9, object_3) and next(object_3, object_5), set next(object_9, object_5); remove vase(object_9, object_3).

5) t=4, dur=1 — sip(x=object_9, y=object_0, z=object_5)
   At location object_5, create vase(object_9, object_0); remove next(object_9, object_5).

6) t=5, dur=1 — memory(x=object_0, y=object_5, z=object_7)
   Move object_0’s next from object_5 to object_7 (adds next(object_0, object_7), removes next(object_0, object_5)).

7) t=6, dur=1 — paltry(x=object_9, y=object_0, z=object_7)
   Using vase(object_9, object_0) and next(object_0, object_7), set next(object_9, object_7); remove vase(object_9, object_0).

Result: Goal achieved — next(object_9, object_7).
