Goal: achieve next(object_10, object_6)

Plan (timestamps assume unit-duration steps):
1) t=0, duration=1 — clip object_10 object_5 object_9
   Effect: set vase(object_10, object_5); unset next(object_10, object_9).

2) t=1, duration=1 — wretched object_5 object_9 object_8 object_3
   Effect: set next(object_5, object_8); unset next(object_5, object_9).

3) t=2, duration=1 — tightfisted object_10 object_5 object_8
   Effect: set next(object_10, object_8); unset vase(object_10, object_5).

4) t=3, duration=1 — sip object_10 object_0 object_8
   Effect: set vase(object_10, object_0); unset next(object_10, object_8).

5) t=4, duration=1 — memory object_0 object_8 object_6
   Effect: set next(object_0, object_6); unset next(object_0, object_8).

6) t=5, duration=1 — paltry object_10 object_0 object_6
   Effect: set next(object_10, object_6); unset vase(object_10, object_0).

Result: Goal satisfied — next(object_10, object_6).
