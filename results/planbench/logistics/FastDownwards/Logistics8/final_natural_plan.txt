This task involves transporting `package_0` and `package_1` from their initial location (`location_0_0`) to the final destination (`location_0_1`) using `truck_0`, all within `city_0`.

The required sequence of human-readable actions is as follows (assuming each action takes one unit of time/cost):

| Step | Time Elapsed | Action Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **1** | 1 unit | **Load** `package_1` into `truck_0` while both are at `location_0_0`. |
| **2** | 2 units | **Load** `package_0` into `truck_0` while both are at `location_0_0`. |
| **3** | 3 units | **Drive** `truck_0` from `location_0_0` to `location_0_1`. This movement is constrained to stay within `city_0`. |
| **4** | 4 units | **Unload** `package_1` from `truck_0` at `location_0_1`. |
| **5** | 5 units | **Unload** `package_0` from `truck_0` at `location_0_1`. |

*Result: Both `package_0` and `package_1` are now at the goal location, `location_0_1`. Total cost: 5.*
