Here is the human-readable execution of the plan (unit-duration actions, sequential schedule):

1) t=0.00–1.00: clip object_9 object_3 object_5
   - Effect: adds vase(object_9, object_3); removes next(object_9, object_5).

2) t=1.00–2.00: clip object_10 object_3 object_5
   - Effect: adds vase(object_10, object_3); removes next(object_10, object_5).

3) t=2.00–3.00: wretched object_3 object_5 object_6 object_1
   - Effect: adds next(object_3, object_6); removes next(object_3, object_5).

4) t=3.00–4.00: tightfisted object_9 object_3 object_6
   - Effect: adds next(object_9, object_6); removes vase(object_9, object_3).

5) t=4.00–5.00: tightfisted object_10 object_3 object_6
   - Effect: adds next(object_10, object_6); removes vase(object_10, object_3).

Final goal achieved: next(object_10, object_6) and next(object_9, object_6).
