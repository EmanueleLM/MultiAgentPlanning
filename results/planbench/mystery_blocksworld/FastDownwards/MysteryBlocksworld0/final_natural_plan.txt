Here is the human-readable execution of the plan:

1) Time 0s–1s: Execute sip(object_8, object_1, object_7)
   - Preconditions used: hand(object_8), cats(object_1), texture(object_7), next(object_8, object_7), next(object_1, object_7)
   - Effects: add vase(object_8, object_1); delete next(object_8, object_7)

2) Time 1s–2s: Execute memory(object_1, object_7, object_6)
   - Preconditions used: cats(object_1), spring(object_7), spring(object_6), next(object_1, object_7)
   - Effects: add next(object_1, object_6); delete next(object_1, object_7)

3) Time 2s–3s: Execute paltry(object_8, object_1, object_6)
   - Preconditions used: hand(object_8), cats(object_1), texture(object_6), vase(object_8, object_1), next(object_1, object_6)
   - Effects: add next(object_8, object_6); delete vase(object_8, object_1)

Goal achieved: next(object_8, object_6) holds after step 3. Total duration: 3s.
