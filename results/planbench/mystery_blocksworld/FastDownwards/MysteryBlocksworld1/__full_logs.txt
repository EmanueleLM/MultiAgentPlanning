PROBLEM
------------------------------
I am playing with a set of objects. Here are the actions I can do

   Attack object
   Feast object from another object
   Succumb object
   Overcome object from another object

I have the following restrictions on my actions:
    To perform Attack action, the following facts need to be true: Province object, Planet object, Harmony.
    Once Attack action is performed the following facts will be true: Pain object.
    Once Attack action is performed the following facts will be false: Province object, Planet object, Harmony.
    To perform Succumb action, the following facts need to be true: Pain object.
    Once Succumb action is performed the following facts will be true: Province object, Planet object, Harmony.    
    Once Succumb action is performed the following facts will be false: Pain object.
    To perform Overcome action, the following needs to be true: Province other object, Pain object.
    Once Overcome action is performed the following will be true: Harmony, Province object, Object Craves other object.
    Once Overcome action is performed the following will be false: Province other object, Pain object.
    To perform Feast action, the following needs to be true: Object Craves other object, Province object, Harmony.
    Once Feast action is performed the following will be true: Pain object, Province other object.
    Once Feast action is performed the following will be false:, Object Craves other object, Province object, Harmony.

[STATEMENT]
As initial conditions I have that, object a craves object b, object d craves object c, harmony, planet object b, planet object c, province object a and province object d.
My goal is to have that object c craves object a.

My plan is as follows:

NATURAL-PLAN sas_plan_1
------------------------------
This plan outlines the required sequence of actions to transition the system from the initial configuration to the goal state, **Craves(c, a)**.

| Step | Action | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 1. | **Feast** (d, c) | Object $d$ initiates a Feast targeting $c$. This requires $d$ to Crave $c$, $d$ to be a Province, and for Harmony to exist. As a result, $d$ gains Pain, $c$ becomes a Province, and the Craving, the Province status of $d$, and Harmony are lost. |
| 2. | **Succumb** (d) | Object $d$ Succumbs to its Pain. This results in $d$ becoming a Province and a Planet again, and Harmony is restored. The Pain of $d$ is removed. |
| 3. | **Attack** (c) | Object $c$ performs an Attack. This requires $c$ to be a Province and a Planet, and for Harmony to exist. As a result, $c$ gains Pain, and its Province status, Planet status, and Harmony are all lost. |
| 4. | **Overcome** (c, a) | Object $c$ Overcomes the situation regarding $a$. This requires $c$ to be in Pain and $a$ to be a Province. As a result, Harmony is restored, $c$ becomes a Province, and the final goal state **Craves(c, a)** is established. The Province status of $a$ and the Pain of $c$ are removed. |

PROBLEM
------------------------------
I am playing with a set of objects. Here are the actions I can do

   Attack object
   Feast object from another object
   Succumb object
   Overcome object from another object

I have the following restrictions on my actions:
    To perform Attack action, the following facts need to be true: Province object, Planet object, Harmony.
    Once Attack action is performed the following facts will be true: Pain object.
    Once Attack action is performed the following facts will be false: Province object, Planet object, Harmony.
    To perform Succumb action, the following facts need to be true: Pain object.
    Once Succumb action is performed the following facts will be true: Province object, Planet object, Harmony.    
    Once Succumb action is performed the following facts will be false: Pain object.
    To perform Overcome action, the following needs to be true: Province other object, Pain object.
    Once Overcome action is performed the following will be true: Harmony, Province object, Object Craves other object.
    Once Overcome action is performed the following will be false: Province other object, Pain object.
    To perform Feast action, the following needs to be true: Object Craves other object, Province object, Harmony.
    Once Feast action is performed the following will be true: Pain object, Province other object.
    Once Feast action is performed the following will be false:, Object Craves other object, Province object, Harmony.

[STATEMENT]
As initial conditions I have that, object b craves object c, object c craves object d, object d craves object a, harmony, planet object a and province object b.
My goal is to have that object a craves object c and object d craves object a.

My plan is as follows:

| Step | Action | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 1 | FEAST (b, c) | Object 'b' performs Feast upon object 'c'. |
| 2 | SUCCUMB (b) | Object 'b' must Succumb. |
| 3 | FEAST (c, d) | Object 'c' performs Feast upon object 'd'. |
| 4 | SUCCUMB (c) | Object 'c' must Succumb. |
| 5 | FEAST (d, a) | Object 'd' performs Feast upon object 'a'. |
| 6 | SUCCUMB (d) | Object 'd' must Succumb. |
| 7 | ATTACK (a) | Object 'a' performs an Attack. |
| 8 | OVERCOME (a, c) | Object 'a' performs Overcome upon object 'c'. |
| 9 | ATTACK (d) | Object 'd' performs an Attack. |
| 10 | OVERCOME (d, a) | Object 'd' performs Overcome upon object 'a'. |
