Here is the human-readable action sequence that follows the given plan exactly and achieves the goal (timestamps in unit steps; each action duration = 1):

- t=0, duration=1: memory(object_0, object_6, object_5)
  - Update the relation for object_0: switch next(object_0, object_6) to next(object_0, object_5).

- t=1, duration=1: sip(object_8, object_0, object_5)
  - Create vase(object_8, object_0) and remove next(object_8, object_5).

- t=2, duration=1: memory(object_0, object_5, object_6)
  - Restore the relation for object_0: switch next(object_0, object_5) back to next(object_0, object_6).

- t=3, duration=1: paltry(object_8, object_0, object_6)
  - Establish next(object_8, object_6) and remove vase(object_8, object_0).

Result: Both goal facts hold — next(object_7, object_6) (already true initially) and next(object_8, object_6) (achieved at t=3). Total cost: 4.
