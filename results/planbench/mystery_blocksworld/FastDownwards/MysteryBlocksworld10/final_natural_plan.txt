Here is the human-readable sequence of actions that follows the given plan exactly. Assume unit durations (1 time unit per action); timestamps show [start → end].

1) [t=0 → 1] wretched(object_4, object_7, object_8, object_2)
   - Re-route next for object_4 from object_7 to object_8 using the required textures, collect-links, and stupendous support.

2) [t=1 → 2] clip(object_10, object_4, object_8)
   - Use hand object_10 with sneeze object_4 at texture object_8 to create vase(object_10, object_4) and free next(object_10, object_8).

3) [t=2 → 3] wretched(object_4, object_8, object_7, object_2)
   - Re-route next for object_4 from object_8 back to object_7 under the same stupendous/collect conditions.

4) [t=3 → 4] tightfisted(object_10, object_4, object_7)
   - Convert the vase link to next(object_10, object_7), removing vase(object_10, object_4).

5) [t=4 → 5] wretched(object_3, object_5, object_6, object_1)
   - Re-route next for object_3 from object_5 to object_6 using stupendous object_1 and required collects.

6) [t=5 → 6] clip(object_11, object_3, object_6)
   - Use hand object_11 with sneeze object_3 at texture object_6 to create vase(object_11, object_3) and free next(object_11, object_6).

7) [t=6 → 7] wretched(object_3, object_6, object_5, object_1)
   - Re-route next for object_3 from object_6 back to object_5 under the same stupendous/collect conditions.

8) [t=7 → 8] tightfisted(object_11, object_3, object_5)
   - Convert the vase link to next(object_11, object_5), removing vase(object_11, object_3).

9) [t=8 → 9] sip(object_9, object_0, object_5)
   - With both next(object_9, object_5) and next(object_0, object_5), create vase(object_9, object_0) and remove next(object_9, object_5).

10) [t=9 → 10] sip(object_11, object_0, object_5)
    - With both next(object_11, object_5) and next(object_0, object_5), create vase(object_11, object_0) and remove next(object_11, object_5).

11) [t=10 → 11] memory(object_0, object_5, object_7)
    - Shift next for cats object_0 from object_5 to object_7 using spring locations.

12) [t=11 → 12] paltry(object_9, object_0, object_7)
    - Using vase(object_9, object_0) and next(object_0, object_7), establish next(object_9, object_7) and remove the vase link.

13) [t=12 → 13] paltry(object_11, object_0, object_7)
    - Using vase(object_11, object_0) and next(object_0, object_7), establish next(object_11, object_7) and remove the vase link.

Final goal achieved:
- next(object_10, object_7)
- next(object_11, object_7)
- next(object_9, object_7)
