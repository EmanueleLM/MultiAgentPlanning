PROBLEM
------------------------------
I am playing with a set of objects. Here are the actions I can do

   Attack object
   Feast object from another object
   Succumb object
   Overcome object from another object

I have the following restrictions on my actions:
    To perform Attack action, the following facts need to be true: Province object, Planet object, Harmony.
    Once Attack action is performed the following facts will be true: Pain object.
    Once Attack action is performed the following facts will be false: Province object, Planet object, Harmony.
    To perform Succumb action, the following facts need to be true: Pain object.
    Once Succumb action is performed the following facts will be true: Province object, Planet object, Harmony.    
    Once Succumb action is performed the following facts will be false: Pain object.
    To perform Overcome action, the following needs to be true: Province other object, Pain object.
    Once Overcome action is performed the following will be true: Harmony, Province object, Object Craves other object.
    Once Overcome action is performed the following will be false: Province other object, Pain object.
    To perform Feast action, the following needs to be true: Object Craves other object, Province object, Harmony.
    Once Feast action is performed the following will be true: Pain object, Province other object.
    Once Feast action is performed the following will be false:, Object Craves other object, Province object, Harmony.

[STATEMENT]
As initial conditions I have that, object a craves object d, object b craves object c, harmony, planet object c, planet object d, province object a and province object b.
My goal is to have that object b craves object d and object d craves object a.

NATURAL-PLAN sas_plan_3
------------------------------
Based on the provided specification, PDDL environment, and the planned sequence of operations, here are the human-readable instructions to achieve the goal: (Object A Craves Object B).

This plan outlines 6 sequential steps required to manipulate the state predicates of objects a, b, c, and d.

| Step | Time | Action | Detailed Instruction |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 1 | T+1 | **Feast (C, B)** | Object C executes a Feast concerning Object B. (Requires C to Crave B, C to be a Province, and Harmony). This action causes Object C to enter a state of Pain, removes its Province status, and destroys the state of Harmony. Object B gains Province status. |
| 2 | T+2 | **Succumb (C)** | Object C Succumbs to its Pain. (Requires C to be in Pain). This action restores Harmony, and grants Province and Planet status back to Object C. Object C is relieved of Pain. |
| 3 | T+3 | **Feast (D, A)** | Object D executes a Feast concerning Object A. (Requires D to Crave A, D to be a Province, and Harmony). This action causes Object D to enter a state of Pain, removes its Province status, and destroys the state of Harmony. Object A gains Province status (in addition to being a Planet). |
| 4 | T+4 | **Succumb (D)** | Object D Succumbs to its Pain. (Requires D to be in Pain). This action restores Harmony, and grants Province and Planet status back to Object D. Object D is relieved of Pain. |
| 5 | T+5 | **Attack (A)** | Object A launches an Attack. (Requires A to be a Province, A to be a Planet, and Harmony). This action causes Object A to enter a state of Pain, removes its Province and Planet status, and destroys the state of Harmony. |
| 6 | T+6 | **Overcome (A, B)** | Object A, while in Pain, Overcomes Object B. (Requires A to be in Pain and B to be a Province). This crucial step results in **Object A Craving Object B** (Goal Achieved). Harmony is restored, Object A becomes a Province, and Object B loses its Province status. |
