Here is the human-readable execution of the plan, preserving the exact action sequence and arguments. Each action starts at the indicated timestamp, lasts 1 time unit, and ends at start+1.

1) t=0 to 1 (dur=1): clip object_10 object_4 object_8
- Agent object_10 pairs with sneezer object_4 at textured object_8, creating vase(object_10, object_4) and removing next(object_10, object_8).

2) t=1 to 2 (dur=1): wretched object_4 object_8 object_7 object_2
- Sneezer object_4 shifts adjacency from texture object_8 to texture object_7 (via stupendous object_2), replacing next(object_4, object_8) with next(object_4, object_7).

3) t=2 to 3 (dur=1): tightfisted object_10 object_4 object_7
- Using vase(object_10, object_4) and next(object_4, object_7), agent object_10 becomes next to object_7 and drops vase(object_10, object_4).

4) t=3 to 4 (dur=1): wretched object_3 object_5 object_6 object_1
- Sneezer object_3 shifts adjacency from texture object_5 to texture object_6 (via stupendous object_1), replacing next(object_3, object_5) with next(object_3, object_6).

5) t=4 to 5 (dur=1): clip object_12 object_3 object_6
- Agent object_12 pairs with sneezer object_3 at textured object_6, creating vase(object_12, object_3) and removing next(object_12, object_6).

6) t=5 to 6 (dur=1): sip object_9 object_0 object_7
- Agent object_9 and cat object_0 meet at texture object_7; create vase(object_9, object_0) and remove next(object_9, object_7).

7) t=6 to 7 (dur=1): sip object_10 object_0 object_7
- Agent object_10 and cat object_0 meet at texture object_7; create vase(object_10, object_0) and remove next(object_10, object_7).

8) t=7 to 8 (dur=1): memory object_0 object_7 object_5
- Cat object_0 moves adjacency from texture object_7 to texture object_5, replacing next(object_0, object_7) with next(object_0, object_5).

9) t=8 to 9 (dur=1): paltry object_9 object_0 object_5
- With vase(object_9, object_0) and next(object_0, object_5), agent object_9 becomes next to object_5 and drops vase(object_9, object_0).

10) t=9 to 10 (dur=1): sip object_11 object_0 object_5
- Agent object_11 and cat object_0 meet at texture object_5; create vase(object_11, object_0) and remove next(object_11, object_5).

11) t=10 to 11 (dur=1): paltry object_10 object_0 object_5
- With vase(object_10, object_0) and next(object_0, object_5), agent object_10 becomes next to object_5 and drops vase(object_10, object_0).

12) t=11 to 12 (dur=1): wretched object_3 object_6 object_5 object_1
- Sneezer object_3 shifts adjacency from texture object_6 back to texture object_5 (via stupendous object_1), replacing next(object_3, object_6) with next(object_3, object_5).

13) t=12 to 13 (dur=1): clip object_9 object_3 object_5
- Agent object_9 pairs with sneezer object_3 at textured object_5, creating vase(object_9, object_3) and removing next(object_9, object_5).

14) t=13 to 14 (dur=1): tightfisted object_12 object_3 object_5
- Using vase(object_12, object_3) and next(object_3, object_5), agent object_12 becomes next to object_5 and drops vase(object_12, object_3).

15) t=14 to 15 (dur=1): clip object_10 object_3 object_5
- Agent object_10 pairs with sneezer object_3 at textured object_5, creating vase(object_10, object_3) and removing next(object_10, object_5).

16) t=15 to 16 (dur=1): wretched object_3 object_5 object_6 object_1
- Sneezer object_3 shifts adjacency from texture object_5 to texture object_6 (via stupendous object_1), replacing next(object_3, object_5) with next(object_3, object_6).

17) t=16 to 17 (dur=1): tightfisted object_9 object_3 object_6
- Using vase(object_9, object_3) and next(object_3, object_6), agent object_9 becomes next to object_6 and drops vase(object_9, object_3).

18) t=17 to 18 (dur=1): tightfisted object_10 object_3 object_6
- Using vase(object_10, object_3) and next(object_3, object_6), agent object_10 becomes next to object_6 and drops vase(object_10, object_3).

19) t=18 to 19 (dur=1): sip object_12 object_0 object_5
- Agent object_12 and cat object_0 meet at texture object_5; create vase(object_12, object_0) and remove next(object_12, object_5).

20) t=19 to 20 (dur=1): memory object_0 object_5 object_7
- Cat object_0 moves adjacency from texture object_5 back to texture object_7, replacing next(object_0, object_5) with next(object_0, object_7).

21) t=20 to 21 (dur=1): paltry object_12 object_0 object_7
- With vase(object_12, object_0) and next(object_0, object_7), agent object_12 becomes next to object_7 and drops vase(object_12, object_0).

22) t=21 to 22 (dur=1): paltry object_11 object_0 object_7
- With vase(object_11, object_0) and next(object_0, object_7), agent object_11 becomes next to object_7 and drops vase(object_11, object_0).

End state satisfies the goals:
- next(object_10, object_6)
- next(object_11, object_7)
- next(object_12, object_7)
- next(object_9, object_6)
