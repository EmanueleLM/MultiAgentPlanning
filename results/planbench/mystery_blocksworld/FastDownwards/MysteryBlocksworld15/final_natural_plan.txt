Based on the provided environment specification, the PDDL domain definition, and the calculated plan, the required goal state can be reached by executing the following sequence of eight abstract operations:

| Step | Action | Description |
| :--- | :----- | :---------- |
| 1 | (feast a d) | Agent 'a', who currently craves 'd', initiates a **Feast** upon 'd'. (Removes: Craving (a, d), Province (a), Harmony. Adds: Pain (a), Province (d)). |
| 2 | (succumb a) | Agent 'a', currently in Pain, decides to **Succumb**. (Removes: Pain (a). Adds: Province (a), Planet (a), Harmony). |
| 3 | (feast d c) | Agent 'd', who currently craves 'c', initiates a **Feast** upon 'c'. (Removes: Craving (d, c), Province (d), Harmony. Adds: Pain (d), Province (c)). |
| 4 | (succumb d) | Agent 'd', currently in Pain, decides to **Succumb**. (Removes: Pain (d). Adds: Province (d), Planet (d), Harmony). |
| 5 | (attack c) | Agent 'c', being a Province, a Planet, and in Harmony, launches an **Attack**. (Removes: Province (c), Planet (c), Harmony. Adds: Pain (c)). |
| 6 | (overcome c d) | Agent 'c', currently in Pain, **Overcomes** agent 'd' (which is a Province). (Removes: Pain (c), Province (d). Adds: Harmony, Province (c), Craving (c, d)). |
| 7 | (attack b) | Agent 'b', being a Province, a Planet, and in Harmony, launches an **Attack**. (Removes: Province (b), Planet (b), Harmony. Adds: Pain (b)). |
| 8 | (overcome b c) | Agent 'b', currently in Pain, **Overcomes** agent 'c' (which is a Province). (Removes: Pain (b), Province (c). Adds: Harmony, Province (b), Craving (b, c)). |

**Resulting State:** The goal condition is met: (craves b c) and (craves c d) are true.
