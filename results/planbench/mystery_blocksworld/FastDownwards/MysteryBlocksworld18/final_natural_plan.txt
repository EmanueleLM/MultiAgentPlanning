Here is the human-readable action sequence following the given plan. Each action is assumed to take 1 time unit; timestamps are start times.

1. t=00:00 (dur=1) — Clip(o0=object_11, o1=object_5, o2=object_9)
   - Effect: add vase(object_11, object_5); delete next(object_11, object_9).

2. t=00:01 (dur=1) — Wretched(o0=object_5, o1=object_9, o2=object_8, o3=object_3)
   - Effect: add next(object_5, object_8); delete next(object_5, object_9).

3. t=00:02 (dur=1) — Tightfisted(o0=object_11, o1=object_5, o2=object_8)
   - Effect: add next(object_11, object_8); delete vase(object_11, object_5).

4. t=00:03 (dur=1) — Clip(o0=object_10, o1=object_4, o2=object_7)
   - Effect: add vase(object_10, object_4); delete next(object_10, object_7).

5. t=00:04 (dur=1) — Sip(o0=object_12, o1=object_1, o2=object_8)
   - Effect: add vase(object_12, object_1); delete next(object_12, object_8).

6. t=00:05 (dur=1) — Memory(o0=object_1, o1=object_8, o2=object_6)
   - Effect: add next(object_1, object_6); delete next(object_1, object_8).

7. t=00:06 (dur=1) — Wretched(o0=object_4, o1=object_7, o2=object_6, o3=object_2)
   - Effect: add next(object_4, object_6); delete next(object_4, object_7).

8. t=00:07 (dur=1) — Tightfisted(o0=object_10, o1=object_4, o2=object_6)
   - Effect: add next(object_10, object_6); delete vase(object_10, object_4).

9. t=00:08 (dur=1) — Paltry(o0=object_12, o1=object_1, o2=object_6)
   - Effect: add next(object_12, object_6); delete vase(object_12, object_1).

10. t=00:09 (dur=1) — Clip(o0=object_12, o1=object_4, o2=object_6)
    - Effect: add vase(object_12, object_4); delete next(object_12, object_6).

11. t=00:10 (dur=1) — Wretched(o0=object_4, o1=object_6, o2=object_7, o3=object_2)
    - Effect: add next(object_4, object_7); delete next(object_4, object_6).

12. t=00:11 (dur=1) — Tightfisted(o0=object_12, o1=object_4, o2=object_7)
    - Effect: add next(object_12, object_7); delete vase(object_12, object_4).

Final goal achieved at t=00:11:
- next(object_10, object_6)
- next(object_11, object_8)
- next(object_12, object_7)
- next(object_13, object_9) (remained true throughout)
