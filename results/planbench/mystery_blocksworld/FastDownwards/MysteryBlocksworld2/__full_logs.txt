PROBLEM
------------------------------
I am playing with a set of objects. Here are the actions I can do

   Attack object
   Feast object from another object
   Succumb object
   Overcome object from another object

I have the following restrictions on my actions:
    To perform Attack action, the following facts need to be true: Province object, Planet object, Harmony.
    Once Attack action is performed the following facts will be true: Pain object.
    Once Attack action is performed the following facts will be false: Province object, Planet object, Harmony.
    To perform Succumb action, the following facts need to be true: Pain object.
    Once Succumb action is performed the following facts will be true: Province object, Planet object, Harmony.    
    Once Succumb action is performed the following facts will be false: Pain object.
    To perform Overcome action, the following needs to be true: Province other object, Pain object.
    Once Overcome action is performed the following will be true: Harmony, Province object, Object Craves other object.
    Once Overcome action is performed the following will be false: Province other object, Pain object.
    To perform Feast action, the following needs to be true: Object Craves other object, Province object, Harmony.
    Once Feast action is performed the following will be true: Pain object, Province other object.
    Once Feast action is performed the following will be false:, Object Craves other object, Province object, Harmony.

[STATEMENT]
As initial conditions I have that, object a craves object c, object c craves object b, object d craves object a, harmony, planet object b and province object d.
My goal is to have that object a craves object d and object d craves object b.

My plan is as follows:

NATURAL-PLAN sas_plan_0
------------------------------
Based on the provided PDDL domain, problem, and plan, the high-level abstract relationships translate into the following sequence of human-readable actions:

### Sequence of Actions

1.  **D** initiates a **Feast** targeting **A**.
2.  **D** chooses to **Succumb** (recovering stability and harmony).
3.  **A** initiates a **Feast** targeting **C**.
4.  **A**, suffering Pain, decides to **Overcome** **D**. (A now Craves D).
5.  **C** initiates a **Feast** targeting **B**.
6.  **C** chooses to **Succumb** (recovering stability and harmony).
7.  **A** initiates a **Feast** targeting **D**.
8.  **A** chooses to **Succumb** (recovering stability and harmony).
9.  **D** initiates an **Attack**.
10. **D**, suffering Pain, decides to **Overcome** **B**. (D now Craves B).
11. **A** initiates an **Attack**.
12. **A**, suffering Pain, decides to **Overcome** **D**. (A confirms Craving D).

*(Goal achieved: A craves D, and D craves B.)*
