Here is a clear, step-by-step human-readable execution of the provided plan. Each step shows a timestamp (cumulative), an estimated duration, the required preconditions at the time of execution, and the effects produced. The sequence follows the plan exactly (no additions or deletions).

Initial relevant facts (before step 1)
- cats object_0
- collect object_5 object_1
- collect object_6 object_2
- hand object_7
- hand object_8
- next object_0 object_6
- next object_3 object_5
- next object_4 object_6
- next object_7 object_6
- next object_8 object_6
- sneeze object_3
- sneeze object_4
- spring object_5
- spring object_6
- stupendous object_1
- stupendous object_2
- texture object_5
- texture object_6

Step 1 — t = 0.0s, duration ≈ 1.0s
Action: sip object_8 object_0 object_6
- Preconditions (checked against current state):
  - hand object_8 (true)
  - cats object_0 (true)
  - texture object_6 (true)
  - next object_8 object_6 (true)
  - next object_0 object_6 (true)
- Effects (applied immediately):
  - Add: vase object_8 object_0
  - Delete: next object_8 object_6
- Resulting relevant facts after Step 1:
  - vase object_8 object_0 (new)
  - next object_8 object_6 (removed)
  - next object_7 object_6 (still true)
  - next object_0 object_6 (still true)

Step 2 — t = 1.0s, duration ≈ 1.0s
Action: sip object_7 object_0 object_6
- Preconditions:
  - hand object_7 (true)
  - cats object_0 (true)
  - texture object_6 (true)
  - next object_7 object_6 (true)
  - next object_0 object_6 (true)
- Effects:
  - Add: vase object_7 object_0
  - Delete: next object_7 object_6
- Resulting relevant facts after Step 2:
  - vase object_7 object_0 (new)
  - next object_7 object_6 (removed)
  - next object_0 object_6 (still true)
  - vase object_8 object_0 (from Step 1)

Step 3 — t = 2.0s, duration ≈ 1.0s
Action: memory object_0 object_6 object_5
- Preconditions:
  - cats object_0 (true)
  - spring object_6 (true)
  - spring object_5 (true)
  - next object_0 object_6 (true)
- Effects:
  - Add: next object_0 object_5
  - Delete: next object_0 object_6
- Resulting relevant facts after Step 3:
  - next object_0 object_5 (new)
  - next object_0 object_6 (removed)
  - vase object_8 object_0, vase object_7 object_0 (from prior steps)

Step 4 — t = 3.0s, duration ≈ 1.0s
Action: paltry object_8 object_0 object_5
- Preconditions:
  - hand object_8 (true)
  - cats object_0 (true)
  - texture object_5 (true)
  - vase object_8 object_0 (true)
  - next object_0 object_5 (true)
- Effects:
  - Add: next object_8 object_5
  - Delete: vase object_8 object_0
- Resulting relevant facts after Step 4:
  - next object_8 object_5 (new)
  - vase object_8 object_0 (removed)
  - next object_0 object_5 (still true)
  - vase object_7 object_0 (still present)

Step 5 — t = 4.0s, duration ≈ 1.0s
Action: paltry object_7 object_0 object_5
- Preconditions:
  - hand object_7 (true)
  - cats object_0 (true)
  - texture object_5 (true)
  - vase object_7 object_0 (true)
  - next object_0 object_5 (true)
- Effects:
  - Add: next object_7 object_5
  - Delete: vase object_7 object_0
- Resulting relevant facts after Step 5:
  - next object_7 object_5 (new)
  - next object_8 object_5 (from Step 4)
  - vase object_7 object_0 (removed)

Goal check (after Step 5)
- Required goal: next object_7 object_5 and next object_8 object_5
- Achieved: next object_7 object_5 (true), next object_8 object_5 (true)
- Conclusion: Goal achieved at t ≈ 5.0s (after executing step 5).

Notes
- Each step above exactly matches the corresponding plan action and parameters.
- Preconditions listed are those required by the domain and were true at the time each action executed (per the sequence).
- Effects are the add/delete effects stated in the domain and applied in sequence to reach the final goal.
