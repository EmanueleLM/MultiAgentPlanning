Here is a clear, human-readable rendition of the given plan. Each step lists the exact action and parameters, along with a timestamp and unit duration.

- t=0, duration=1
  Action: wretched(object_5, object_9, object_10, object_3)
  Effect: Redirects the link for object_5 from next(object_5, object_9) to next(object_5, object_10).

- t=1, duration=1
  Action: clip(object_12, object_5, object_10)
  Effect: Creates vase(object_12, object_5) and removes next(object_12, object_10).

- t=2, duration=1
  Action: wretched(object_5, object_10, object_11, object_3)
  Effect: Redirects the link for object_5 from next(object_5, object_10) to next(object_5, object_11).

- t=3, duration=1
  Action: tightfisted(object_12, object_5, object_11)
  Effect: Creates next(object_12, object_11) and removes vase(object_12, object_5).

Outcome: Goal achieved — next(object_12, object_11) holds.
