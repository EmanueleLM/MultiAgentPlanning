Action sequence to achieve the goal (next object_11 object_7) and (next object_12 object_5). Each step has unit duration and consecutive timestamps.

1. t=0..1 (dur=1): wretched(object_4, object_8, object_10, object_2) — change next(object_4) from object_8 to object_10.
2. t=1..2 (dur=1): clip(object_12, object_4, object_10) — create vase(object_12, object_4); remove next(object_12, object_10).
3. t=2..3 (dur=1): wretched(object_4, object_10, object_8, object_2) — change next(object_4) from object_10 to object_8.
4. t=3..4 (dur=1): wretched(object_4, object_8, object_9, object_2) — change next(object_4) from object_8 to object_9.
5. t=4..5 (dur=1): clip(object_11, object_4, object_9) — create vase(object_11, object_4); remove next(object_11, object_9).
6. t=5..6 (dur=1): wretched(object_4, object_9, object_8, object_2) — change next(object_4) from object_9 to object_8.
7. t=6..7 (dur=1): tightfisted(object_12, object_4, object_8) — add next(object_12, object_8); remove vase(object_12, object_4).
8. t=7..8 (dur=1): tightfisted(object_11, object_4, object_8) — add next(object_11, object_8); remove vase(object_11, object_4).
9. t=8..9 (dur=1): wretched(object_3, object_6, object_5, object_1) — change next(object_3) from object_6 to object_5.
10. t=9..10 (dur=1): memory(object_0, object_5, object_8) — change next(object_0) from object_5 to object_8.
11. t=10..11 (dur=1): sip(object_12, object_0, object_8) — create vase(object_12, object_0); remove next(object_12, object_8).
12. t=11..12 (dur=1): sip(object_11, object_0, object_8) — create vase(object_11, object_0); remove next(object_11, object_8).
13. t=12..13 (dur=1): memory(object_0, object_8, object_5) — change next(object_0) from object_8 to object_5.
14. t=13..14 (dur=1): paltry(object_12, object_0, object_5) — add next(object_12, object_5); remove vase(object_12, object_0).
15. t=14..15 (dur=1): paltry(object_11, object_0, object_5) — add next(object_11, object_5); remove vase(object_11, object_0).
16. t=15..16 (dur=1): clip(object_11, object_3, object_5) — create vase(object_11, object_3); remove next(object_11, object_5).
17. t=16..17 (dur=1): wretched(object_3, object_5, object_7, object_1) — change next(object_3) from object_5 to object_7.
18. t=17..18 (dur=1): tightfisted(object_11, object_3, object_7) — add next(object_11, object_7); remove vase(object_11, object_3).

Goal achieved at t=18: next(object_12, object_5) and next(object_11, object_7).
