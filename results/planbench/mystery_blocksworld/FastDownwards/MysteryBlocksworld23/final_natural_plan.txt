Here is the human-readable sequence following the provided plan exactly. Assume unit duration per action; timestamps use [start, end) in time units.

1. t=[0,1): Apply CLIP with x=object_12, y=object_5, z=object_11
   Effects: add vase object_12 object_5; remove next object_12 object_11

2. t=[1,2): Apply WRETCHED with x=object_5, y=object_11, z=object_10, w=object_3
   Effects: add next object_5 object_10; remove next object_5 object_11

3. t=[2,3): Apply TIGHTFISTED with x=object_12, y=object_5, z=object_10
   Effects: add next object_12 object_10; remove vase object_12 object_5

4. t=[3,4): Apply WRETCHED with x=object_4, y=object_8, z=object_6, w=object_2
   Effects: add next object_4 object_6; remove next object_4 object_8

5. t=[4,5): Apply WRETCHED with x=object_4, y=object_6, z=object_7, w=object_2
   Effects: add next object_4 object_7; remove next object_4 object_6

6. t=[5,6): Apply CLIP with x=object_13, y=object_4, z=object_7
   Effects: add vase object_13 object_4; remove next object_13 object_7

7. t=[6,7): Apply WRETCHED with x=object_4, y=object_7, z=object_6, w=object_2
   Effects: add next object_4 object_6; remove next object_4 object_7

8. t=[7,8): Apply TIGHTFISTED with x=object_13, y=object_4, z=object_6
   Effects: add next object_13 object_6; remove vase object_13 object_4

9. t=[8,9): Apply MEMORY with x=object_0, y=object_9, z=object_6
   Effects: add next object_0 object_6; remove next object_0 object_9

10. t=[9,10): Apply SIP with x=object_13, y=object_0, z=object_6
    Effects: add vase object_13 object_0; remove next object_13 object_6

11. t=[10,11): Apply MEMORY with x=object_0, y=object_6, z=object_9
    Effects: add next object_0 object_9; remove next object_0 object_6

12. t=[11,12): Apply PALTRY with x=object_13, y=object_0, z=object_9
    Effects: add next object_13 object_9; remove vase object_13 object_0

Goal achieved: next object_12 object_10 and next object_13 object_9.
