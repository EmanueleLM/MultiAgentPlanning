Here is the human-readable rendition of the given plan. Each step preserves the exact action and arguments, in order, with brief plain-language descriptions. Timestamps assume unit-duration steps.

1) T+00, dur=1 — clip(object_11, object_4, object_10): Using hand object_11 and sneezer object_4 at textured object_10 (both next to object_10), create a vase link between object_11 and object_4; remove next(object_11, object_10).

2) T+01, dur=1 — wretched(object_4, object_10, object_8, object_2): Redirect sneezer object_4 from texture object_10 to texture object_8 via stupendous object_2; replace next(object_4, object_10) with next(object_4, object_8).

3) T+02, dur=1 — tightfisted(object_11, object_4, object_8): Using the vase link to object_4 and next(object_4, object_8), place object_11 next to object_8; remove the vase link (object_11, object_4).

4) T+03, dur=1 — wretched(object_4, object_8, object_10, object_2): Move sneezer object_4 back from texture object_8 to texture object_10 via stupendous object_2; replace next(object_4, object_8) with next(object_4, object_10).

5) T+04, dur=1 — wretched(object_4, object_10, object_9, object_2): Shift sneezer object_4 from texture object_10 to texture object_9 via stupendous object_2; replace next(object_4, object_10) with next(object_4, object_9).

6) T+05, dur=1 — clip(object_13, object_4, object_9): With hand object_13 and sneezer object_4 at textured object_9 (both next to object_9), create a vase link between object_13 and object_4; remove next(object_13, object_9).

7) T+06, dur=1 — wretched(object_4, object_9, object_10, object_2): Move sneezer object_4 from texture object_9 to texture object_10 via stupendous object_2; replace next(object_4, object_9) with next(object_4, object_10).

8) T+07, dur=1 — tightfisted(object_13, object_4, object_10): Using the vase link to object_4 and next(object_4, object_10), place object_13 next to object_10; remove the vase link (object_13, object_4).

9) T+08, dur=1 — wretched(object_3, object_7, object_5, object_1): Redirect sneezer object_3 from texture object_7 to texture object_5 via stupendous object_1; replace next(object_3, object_7) with next(object_3, object_5).

10) T+09, dur=1 — wretched(object_3, object_5, object_6, object_1): Move sneezer object_3 from texture object_5 to texture object_6 via stupendous object_1; replace next(object_3, object_5) with next(object_3, object_6).

11) T+10, dur=1 — clip(object_12, object_3, object_6): With hand object_12 and sneezer object_3 at textured object_6 (both next to object_6), create a vase link between object_12 and object_3; remove next(object_12, object_6).

12) T+11, dur=1 — wretched(object_3, object_6, object_5, object_1): Move sneezer object_3 from texture object_6 back to texture object_5 via stupendous object_1; replace next(object_3, object_6) with next(object_3, object_5).

13) T+12, dur=1 — tightfisted(object_12, object_3, object_5): Using the vase link to object_3 and next(object_3, object_5), place object_12 next to object_5; remove the vase link (object_12, object_3).

14) T+13, dur=1 — memory(object_0, object_8, object_5): Re-route cats object_0 from spring object_8 to spring object_5; replace next(object_0, object_8) with next(object_0, object_5).

15) T+14, dur=1 — sip(object_12, object_0, object_5): With hand object_12 and cats object_0 at textured object_5 (both next to object_5), create a vase link between object_12 and object_0; remove next(object_12, object_5).

16) T+15, dur=1 — memory(object_0, object_5, object_8): Move cats object_0 back from spring object_5 to spring object_8; replace next(object_0, object_5) with next(object_0, object_8).

17) T+16, dur=1 — paltry(object_12, object_0, object_8): Using the vase link to object_0 and next(object_0, object_8) at textured object_8, place object_12 next to object_8; remove the vase link (object_12, object_0).

Result: Achieves the goal facts next(object_11, object_8), next(object_12, object_8), and next(object_13, object_10).
