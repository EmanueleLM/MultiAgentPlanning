Here is the human-readable sequence of actions that achieves the goal. Each action takes 1 time unit; timestamps are cumulative.

1 [t=0]: wretched(object_3, object_6, object_7, object_1) — reroute next for object_3 from object_6 to object_7.
2 [t=1]: clip(object_13, object_3, object_7) — create vase(object_13, object_3); remove next(object_13, object_7).
3 [t=2]: clip(object_12, object_3, object_7) — create vase(object_12, object_3); remove next(object_12, object_7).
4 [t=3]: wretched(object_3, object_7, object_5, object_1) — reroute next for object_3 from object_7 to object_5.
5 [t=4]: tightfisted(object_13, object_3, object_5) — create next(object_13, object_5); remove vase(object_13, object_3).
6 [t=5]: tightfisted(object_12, object_3, object_5) — create next(object_12, object_5); remove vase(object_12, object_3).
7 [t=6]: memory(object_0, object_8, object_5) — move next for object_0 from object_8 to object_5.
8 [t=7]: sip(object_13, object_0, object_5) — create vase(object_13, object_0); remove next(object_13, object_5).
9 [t=8]: sip(object_12, object_0, object_5) — create vase(object_12, object_0); remove next(object_12, object_5).
10 [t=9]: wretched(object_4, object_9, object_10, object_2) — reroute next for object_4 from object_9 to object_10.
11 [t=10]: clip(object_11, object_4, object_10) — create vase(object_11, object_4); remove next(object_11, object_10).
12 [t=11]: wretched(object_4, object_10, object_8, object_2) — reroute next for object_4 from object_10 to object_8.
13 [t=12]: tightfisted(object_11, object_4, object_8) — create next(object_11, object_8); remove vase(object_11, object_4).
14 [t=13]: memory(object_0, object_5, object_8) — move next for object_0 from object_5 to object_8.
15 [t=14]: paltry(object_13, object_0, object_8) — create next(object_13, object_8); remove vase(object_13, object_0).
16 [t=15]: clip(object_13, object_4, object_8) — create vase(object_13, object_4); remove next(object_13, object_8).
17 [t=16]: paltry(object_12, object_0, object_8) — create next(object_12, object_8); remove vase(object_12, object_0).
18 [t=17]: clip(object_12, object_4, object_8) — create vase(object_12, object_4); remove next(object_12, object_8).
19 [t=18]: wretched(object_4, object_8, object_10, object_2) — reroute next for object_4 from object_8 to object_10.
20 [t=19]: tightfisted(object_13, object_4, object_10) — create next(object_13, object_10); remove vase(object_13, object_4).
21 [t=20]: wretched(object_4, object_10, object_9, object_2) — reroute next for object_4 from object_10 to object_9.
22 [t=21]: tightfisted(object_12, object_4, object_9) — create next(object_12, object_9); remove vase(object_12, object_4).
23 [t=22]: sip(object_11, object_0, object_8) — create vase(object_11, object_0); remove next(object_11, object_8).
24 [t=23]: memory(object_0, object_8, object_5) — move next for object_0 from object_8 to object_5.
25 [t=24]: paltry(object_11, object_0, object_5) — create next(object_11, object_5); remove vase(object_11, object_0).

Outcome: achieves all goals — next(object_11, object_5), next(object_12, object_9), and next(object_13, object_10).
