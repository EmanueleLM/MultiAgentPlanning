Below is a clear, step-by-step human-readable trace of the plan. Each step corresponds exactly to one action in the supplied PDDL plan, in the same order. For each step I give: a timestamp (assuming unit-duration actions, starting at t=0), the action name and parameters, the required preconditions (as used from the domain), and the effects (additions and deletions). All actions are instantaneous with duration = 1 time unit (so step n occurs at t = n-1).

Plan completion (after t=23):
- The goal facts required by the problem are achieved:
  - next(object_11,object_5) — created at Step 15 and not deleted afterwards
  - next(object_12,object_9) — created at Step 24
  - next(object_13,object_10) — created at Step 22
- Total actions: 24; cost = 24 (each action assumed unit cost/duration)

This trace follows the provided PDDL plan exactly, lists preconditions and effects used from the domain model, and reports timestamps assuming each action takes 1 time unit.
