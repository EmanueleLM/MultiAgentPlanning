Here is the human-readable execution of the provided plan. Each step lists the timestamp (unit-duration assumed), the action with bound objects, and a brief effect summary.

- Step 1 (t=0→1): wretched(w=object_4, x=object_10, y=object_8, z=object_2) — Effect: add next(object_4, object_8); delete next(object_4, object_10).

- Step 6 (t=5→6): memory(x=object_0, y=object_8, z=object_5) — Effect: add next(object_0, object_5); delete next(object_0, object_8).
- Step 7 (t=6→7): paltry(x=object_12, y=object_0, z=object_5) — Effect: add next(object_12, object_5); delete vase(object_12, object_0).
- Step 8 (t=7→8): wretched(w=object_3, x=object_6, y=object_5, z=object_1) — Effect: add next(object_3, object_5); delete next(object_3, object_6).
- Step 9 (t=8→9): clip(x=object_14, y=object_3, z=object_5) — Effect: add vase(object_14, object_3); delete next(object_14, object_5).
- Step 10 (t=9→10): tightfisted(x=object_13, y=object_3, z=object_5) — Effect: add next(object_13, object_5); delete vase(object_13, object_3).
- Step 11 (t=10→11): clip(x=object_12, y=object_3, z=object_5) — Effect: add vase(object_12, object_3); delete next(object_12, object_5).
- Step 12 (t=11→12): tightfisted(x=object_11, y=object_3, z=object_5) — Effect: add next(object_11, object_5); delete vase(object_11, object_3).
- Step 13 (t=12→13): wretched(w=object_3, x=object_5, y=object_6, z=object_1) — Effect: add next(object_3, object_6); delete next(object_3, object_5).
- Step 14 (t=13→14): tightfisted(x=object_12, y=object_3, z=object_6) — Effect: add next(object_12, object_6); delete vase(object_12, object_3).
- Step 15 (t=14→15): wretched(w=object_3, x=object_6, y=object_7, z=object_1) — Effect: add next(object_3, object_7); delete next(object_3, object_6).
- Step 16 (t=15→16): tightfisted(x=object_14, y=object_3, z=object_7) — Effect: add next(object_14, object_7); delete vase(object_14, object_3).
- Step 17 (t=16→17): sip(x=object_13, y=object_0, z=object_5) — Effect: add vase(object_13, object_0); delete next(object_13, object_5).
- Step 18 (t=17→18): sip(x=object_11, y=object_0, z=object_5) — Effect: add vase(object_11, object_0); delete next(object_11, object_5).
- Step 19 (t=18→19): memory(x=object_0, y=object_5, z=object_8) — Effect: add next(object_0, object_8); delete next(object_0, object_5).
- Step 20 (t=19→20): paltry(x=object_13, y=object_0, z=object_8) — Effect: add next(object_13, object_8); delete vase(object_13, object_0).
- Step 21 (t=20→21): clip(x=object_13, y=object_4, z=object_8) — Effect: add vase(object_13, object_4); delete next(object_13, object_8).
- Step 22 (t=21→22): paltry(x=object_11, y=object_0, z=object_8) — Effect: add next(object_11, object_8); delete vase(object_11, object_0).
- Step 23 (t=22→23): clip(x=object_11, y=object_4, z=object_8) — Effect: add vase(object_11, object_4); delete next(object_11, object_8).
- Step 24 (t=23→24): wretched(w=object_4, x=object_8, y=object_10, z=object_2) — Effect: add next(object_4, object_10); delete next(object_4, object_8).
- Step 25 (t=24→25): tightfisted(x=object_13, y=object_4, z=object_10) — Effect: add next(object_13, object_10); delete vase(object_13, object_4).
