Below is a clear, step-by-step, human-readable trace of the provided plan. Each step matches the plan exactly, shows a timestamp (1 time unit per step), lists the agent, the action and its parameters, the preconditions that are being used, and the effects made true/false by that action.

Timeline: each step is 1 time unit. Time shown as [start, end).

Step 1 — Time [0,1)

Step 4 — Time [3,4)
- Action: (paltry planner_a object_8 object_1 object_5)
- Agent: planner_a
- Preconditions checked:
  - planner_a has hand object_8
  - cats object_1
  - texture object_5
  - vase object_8 object_1 (created in Step 1)
  - next object_1 object_5 (created in Step 3)
- Effects:
  - Added: next object_8 object_5
  - Removed: vase object_8 object_1

Step 5 — Time [4,5)
- Action: (paltry planner_a object_7 object_1 object_5)
- Agent: planner_a
- Preconditions checked:
  - planner_a has hand object_7
  - cats object_1
  - texture object_5
  - vase object_7 object_1 (created in Step 2)
  - next object_1 object_5 (created in Step 3)
- Effects:
  - Added: next object_7 object_5
  - Removed: vase object_7 object_1

Step 6 — Time [5,6)
- Action: (memory orchestrator object_1 object_5 object_7)
- Agent: orchestrator
- Preconditions checked:
  - cats object_1
  - spring object_5
  - spring object_7
  - next object_1 object_5 (created in Step 3)
- Effects:
  - Added: next object_1 object_7
  - Removed: next object_1 object_5

Step 7 — Time [6,7)
- Action: (sip planner_b object_9 object_1 object_7)
- Agent: planner_b
- Preconditions checked:
  - planner_b has hand object_9
  - cats object_1
  - texture object_7
  - next object_9 object_7
- Effects:
  - Added: vase object_9 object_1
  - Removed: next object_9 object_7

Step 8 — Time [7,8)
- Action: (memory orchestrator object_1 object_7 object_6)
- Agent: orchestrator
- Preconditions checked:
  - cats object_1
  - spring object_7
  - spring object_6
  - next object_1 object_7 (created in Step 6)
- Effects:
  - Added: next object_1 object_6
  - Removed: next object_1 object_7

Step 9 — Time [8,9)
- Action: (paltry planner_b object_9 object_1 object_6)
- Agent: planner_b
- Preconditions checked:
  - planner_b has hand object_9
  - cats object_1
  - texture object_6
  - vase object_9 object_1 (created in Step 7)
  - next object_1 object_6 (created in Step 8)
- Effects:
  - Added: next object_9 object_6
  - Removed: vase object_9 object_1

Final status (relevant facts after all steps):
- next object_7 object_5 — true (created in Step 5)
- next object_8 object_5 — true (created in Step 4)
- next object_8 object_7 — true (was true initially and not removed)
- next object_9 object_6 — true (created in Step 9)

Goal achieved:
- (next object_7 object_5) — satisfied
- (next object_8 object_5) — satisfied
- (next object_8 object_7) — satisfied
- (next object_9 object_6) — satisfied

Plan cost/duration: 9 steps, total duration 9 time units.
