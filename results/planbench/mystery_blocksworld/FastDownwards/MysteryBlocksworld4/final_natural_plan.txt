Plan (3 steps, total cost = 3 units)

Initial assumptions (from the problem file):
- Slot s2 is free, allowed, and available to both analyst_a and analyst_b.
- analyst_a is the agent executing the following actions.

Step 1 — [time 0s, duration 1s]
Action: reserve analyst_a s2
- Natural-language: Reserve slot s2 for analyst_a.
- Preconditions checked (all satisfied at this time): free(s2) AND available(analyst_a, s2) AND allowed(s2).
- Effects (state changes after the action): reserved(s2) becomes true; reserved-for(s2, analyst_a) becomes true; free(s2) becomes false.

Step 2 — [time 1s, duration 1s]
Action: notify analyst_a s2
- Natural-language: Notify analyst_a about the reservation of slot s2.
- Preconditions checked (satisfied at this time): reserved(s2) AND reserved-for(s2, analyst_a). (These were established by Step 1.)
- Effects: notified(analyst_a, s2) becomes true.

Step 3 — [time 2s, duration 1s]
Action: finalize-meeting s2 analyst_a analyst_a
- Natural-language: Finalize the meeting scheduled in slot s2, using analyst_a as both notified participants (the plan uses the same agent for both required notifications).
- Preconditions checked (satisfied at this time): reserved(s2) AND notified(analyst_a, s2) AND notified(analyst_a, s2). (The same notified fact satisfies both required notification slots.)
- Effects: meeting-scheduled becomes true.

Final state / Goal:
- The goal meeting-scheduled is achieved after Step 3.

Notes:
- Timestamps and durations are illustrative (each step given 1s duration, sequential start times at 0s,1s,2s).
- The plan follows the provided PDDL actions exactly, without additions or deletions.
