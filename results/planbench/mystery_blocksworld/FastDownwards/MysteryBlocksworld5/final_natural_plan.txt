- t=0.0 (duration 1): clip object_9 object_4 object_7
  Using hand object_9 and sneezer object_4 at textured object_7; establishes vase(object_9, object_4) and removes next(object_9, object_7).

- t=1.0 (duration 1): wretched object_4 object_7 object_8 object_2
  Redirects object_4 from next(object_4, object_7) to next(object_4, object_8) using stupendous object_2 with required collections.

- t=2.0 (duration 1): tightfisted object_9 object_4 object_8
  Using vase(object_9, object_4) and next(object_4, object_8) to set next(object_9, object_8); removes vase(object_9, object_4).

Final state satisfies the goal: next(object_9, object_8).
