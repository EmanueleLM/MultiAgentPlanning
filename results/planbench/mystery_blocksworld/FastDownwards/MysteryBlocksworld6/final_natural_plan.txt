- Step 2 (t=1): wretched object_5 object_9 object_8 object_3
  - Effect: add (next object_5 object_8), del (next object_5 object_9)

- Step 3 (t=2): tightfisted object_10 object_5 object_8
  - Effect: add (next object_10 object_8), del (vase object_10 object_5)

- Step 4 (t=3): sip object_10 object_0 object_8
