Here is a clear, human-readable sequence of the plan steps (kept exactly as in the plan). Each step shows the action name, the object arguments, a short description of the argument roles (when helpful), the instantaneous timestamp (simple integer seconds) and a 1.0s duration, the preconditions used (noting they are provable at the time), and the net effect relevant to the goals.

Time 0s — Step 1
Action: scenarioa-wretched object_4 object_8 object_9 object_3
- Roles: ?o0 = object_4 (sneeze), ?o1 = object_8 (texture), ?o2 = object_9 (texture), ?o3 = object_3 (stupendous)
- Preconditions provable before this step: sneeze object_4; texture object_8; texture object_9; stupendous object_3; next object_4 object_8; collect object_8 object_3; collect object_9 object_3 — all present in the initial state (or trivially unioned).
- Effect (applied instantaneously at t=0): add next object_4 object_9; remove next object_4 object_8.
- Duration: 1.0s

Time 1s — Step 2
Action: scenarioa-clip object_10 object_4 object_9
- Roles: ?o0 = object_10 (hand), ?o1 = object_4 (sneeze), ?o2 = object_9 (texture)
- Preconditions provable before this step: hand object_10 (init); sneeze object_4 (init); texture object_9 (init); next object_4 object_9 (added by Step 1); next object_10 object_9 (present in init) — all satisfied.
- Effect (applied at t=1s): add vase object_10 object_4; remove next object_10 object_9.
- Duration: 1.0s

Time 2s — Step 3
Action: scenarioa-tightfisted object_10 object_4 object_6
- Roles: ?o0 = object_10 (hand), ?o1 = object_4 (sneeze), ?o2 = object_6 (texture)
- Preconditions provable before this step: hand object_10 (init); sneeze object_4 (init); texture object_6 (init); next object_4 object_6 (present in init); vase object_10 object_4 (added by Step 2) — all satisfied.
- Effect (applied at t=2s): add next object_10 object_6; remove vase object_10 object_4.
- Duration: 1.0s
- Important milestone: next object_10 object_6 (the scenarioA goal) is achieved at this step.

Time 3s — Step 4
Action: scenarioa-sip object_9 object_0 object_8
- Roles: ?o0 = object_9 (hand), ?o1 = object_0 (cats), ?o2 = object_8 (texture)
- Preconditions provable before this step: hand object_9 (init); cats object_0 (init); texture object_8 (init); next object_9 object_8 (init); next object_0 object_8 (init) — all satisfied.
- Effect (applied at t=3s): add vase object_9 object_0; remove next object_9 object_8.
- Duration: 1.0s

Time 4s — Step 5
Action: scenarioa-paltry object_9 object_0 object_7
- Roles: ?o0 = object_9 (hand), ?o1 = object_0 (cats), ?o2 = object_7 (texture)
- Preconditions provable before this step: hand object_9 (init); cats object_0 (init); texture object_7 (init); vase object_9 object_0 (added by Step 4); next object_0 object_7 (present in init) — all satisfied.
- Effect (applied at t=4s): add next object_9 object_7; remove vase object_9 object_0.
- Duration: 1.0s
- Important milestone: next object_9 object_7 (the remaining scenarioB goal) is achieved at this step.

Summary / Goals
- Goals listed in the integrated problem:
  - next object_10 object_6 — achieved at Time 2s (Step 3).
  - next object_10 object_5 — was true in the initial state.
  - next object_9 object_7 — achieved at Time 4s (Step 5).
- All goals are satisfied by the end of the execution.
- Plan cost: 5 (5 unit-cost actions, as indicated in the plan).

Notes
- All five actions are exactly those given in the plan and applied in that order.
- Each action’s preconditions were provable from the initial facts plus effects of earlier steps, so the sequence is valid and achieves the specified goals.
