Below is a clear, human-readable trace of the given plan. Each step matches exactly one action from the plan (same order, same parameters). I give a simple timestamp (each action takes 1 time unit) and list the concrete preconditions checked and the concrete effects produced.

Step 1 — t = 0.0 → 1.0
Action: clip object_9 object_3 object_5
Description: Using hand object_9, apply the "clip" operation with sneeze object_3 and texture object_5.
Preconditions (checked): hand(object_9), sneeze(object_3), texture(object_5), next(object_3,object_5), next(object_9,object_5).
Effects: add vase(object_9,object_3); remove next(object_9,object_5).

Step 2 — t = 1.0 → 2.0
Action: wretched object_3 object_5 object_6 object_1
Description: Run the "wretched" operation with sneeze object_3, textures object_5 and object_6, and stupendous object_1.
Preconditions (checked): sneeze(object_3), texture(object_5), texture(object_6), stupendous(object_1), next(object_3,object_5), collect(object_5,object_1), collect(object_6,object_1).
Effects: add next(object_3,object_6); remove next(object_3,object_5).

Step 3 — t = 2.0 → 3.0
Action: tightfisted object_9 object_3 object_6
Description: Using hand object_9, perform "tightfisted" with sneeze object_3 and texture object_6.
Preconditions (checked): hand(object_9), sneeze(object_3), texture(object_6), next(object_3,object_6), vase(object_9,object_3).
Effects: add next(object_9,object_6); remove vase(object_9,object_3).

Step 4 — t = 3.0 → 4.0
Action: sip object_10 object_0 object_5
Description: Using hand object_10, perform "sip" with cats object_0 and texture object_5.
Preconditions (checked): hand(object_10), cats(object_0), texture(object_5), next(object_10,object_5), next(object_0,object_5).
Effects: add vase(object_10,object_0); remove next(object_10,object_5).

Step 5 — t = 4.0 → 5.0
Action: memory object_0 object_5 object_7
Description: Apply "memory" for cats object_0, springs object_5 and object_7.
Preconditions (checked): cats(object_0), spring(object_5), spring(object_7), next(object_0,object_5).
Effects: add next(object_0,object_7); remove next(object_0,object_5).

Step 6 — t = 5.0 → 6.0
Action: paltry object_10 object_0 object_7
Description: Using hand object_10, perform "paltry" with cats object_0 and texture object_7.
Preconditions (checked): hand(object_10), cats(object_0), texture(object_7), vase(object_10,object_0), next(object_0,object_7).
Effects: add next(object_10,object_7); remove vase(object_10,object_0).

Step 7 — t = 6.0 → 7.0
Action: wretched object_5 object_8 object_9 object_3
Description: Run "wretched" with sneeze object_5, textures object_8 and object_9, stupendous object_3.
Preconditions (checked): sneeze(object_5), texture(object_8), texture(object_9), stupendous(object_3), next(object_5,object_8), collect(object_8,object_3), collect(object_9,object_3).
Effects: add next(object_5,object_9); remove next(object_5,object_8).

Step 8 — t = 7.0 → 8.0
Action: clip object_11 object_5 object_9
Description: Using hand object_11, apply "clip" with sneeze object_5 and texture object_9.
Preconditions (checked): hand(object_11), sneeze(object_5), texture(object_9), next(object_5,object_9), next(object_11,object_9).
Effects: add vase(object_11,object_5); remove next(object_11,object_9).

Step 9 — t = 8.0 → 9.0
Action: wretched object_5 object_9 object_8 object_3
Description: Run "wretched" with sneeze object_5, textures object_9 and object_8, stupendous object_3.
Preconditions (checked): sneeze(object_5), texture(object_9), texture(object_8), stupendous(object_3), next(object_5,object_9), collect(object_9,object_3), collect(object_8,object_3).
Effects: add next(object_5,object_8); remove next(object_5,object_9).

Step 10 — t = 9.0 → 10.0
Action: tightfisted object_11 object_5 object_8
Description: Using hand object_11, perform "tightfisted" with sneeze object_5 and texture object_8.
Preconditions (checked): hand(object_11), sneeze(object_5), texture(object_8), next(object_5,object_8), vase(object_11,object_5).
Effects: add next(object_11,object_8); remove vase(object_11,object_5).

Final goal check (all satisfied by the end of the plan):
- next(object_10,object_6) — became true at Step 3.
- next(object_9,object_6) — became true at Step 3.
- next(object_10,object_7) — became true at Step 6.
- next(object_11,object_8) — became true at Step 10.

All four goal predicates are achieved by t = 10.0 (end of Step 10).
