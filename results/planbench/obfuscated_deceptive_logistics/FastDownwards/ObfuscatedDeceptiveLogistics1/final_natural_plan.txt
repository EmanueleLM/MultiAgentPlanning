Here is the human-readable execution of the given plan (unit-duration steps, sequential):

1) t=0.0–1.0 — Execute: sip object_8 object_1 object_7
   - Effect: creates vase(object_8, object_1), removes next(object_8, object_7)

2) t=1.0–2.0 — Execute: memory object_1 object_7 object_6
   - Effect: changes next(object_1, object_7) to next(object_1, object_6)

3) t=2.0–3.0 — Execute: paltry object_8 object_1 object_6
   - Effect: creates next(object_8, object_6), removes vase(object_8, object_1)

Goal achieved: next(object_8, object_6).
