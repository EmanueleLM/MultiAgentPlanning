Step 1 — (player2_press_spring spring1 vase1 s0 s1 s0)
- Timestamp: t = 0s
- Duration: ~2s
- Action (human-readable): Player2 presses the spring labeled "spring1" while interacting with vase "vase1", causing the slot relation to move from s0→s1 to s1→s0.
- Preconditions checked (all satisfied before execution):
  - spring(spring1) — spring1 exists.
  - vase(vase1) — vase1 exists.
  - hand(player2) = empty — player2's hand is empty.
  - next(s0, s1) — the slot relation s0 → s1 is present.
- Effects produced immediately after the action:
  - stupendous(vase1) becomes true (vase1 becomes "stupendous").
  - next(s0, s1) is removed.
  - next(s1, s0) is added.
- Notes: This action prepares the vase by making it stupendous and flips the next relation so player1 can collect from s1→s0.

Step 2 — (player1_collect vase1 s1 s0 s0)
- Timestamp: t ≈ 2s (immediately after Step 1)
- Duration: ~2s
- Action (human-readable): Player1 collects the vase "vase1" from slot s1 to slot s0 and holds it in hand.
- Preconditions checked (all satisfied at this point):
  - vase(vase1) — vase1 exists.
  - hand(player1) = empty — player1's hand is empty.
  - stupendous(vase1) — vase1 is stupendous (established in Step 1).
  - next(s1, s0) — the slot relation s1 → s0 is present (established in Step 1).
- Effects produced immediately after the action:
  - collect(player1, vase1) becomes true (player1 has collected vase1).
  - hand(player1) = vase1 (player1 now holds vase1).
  - hand(player1) ≠ empty (player1's hand is no longer empty).
  - next(s1, s0) is removed.
  - next(s0, s0) is added.
- Notes: After this step the final goal (player1 has collected vase1 and vase1 is stupendous) is achieved.
