Here is the human-readable execution of the provided plan. Each step matches the plan exactly and uses 1 time unit per action.

- T+00:00 to T+00:01 — wretched x=object_4, y=object_7, z=object_8, w=object_2
- T+00:01 to T+00:02 — clip x=object_10, y=object_4, z=object_8
- T+00:02 to T+00:03 — wretched x=object_4, y=object_8, z=object_7, w=object_2
- T+00:03 to T+00:04 — tightfisted x=object_10, y=object_4, z=object_7
- T+00:04 to T+00:05 — wretched x=object_3, y=object_5, z=object_6, w=object_1
- T+00:05 to T+00:06 — clip x=object_11, y=object_3, z=object_6
- T+00:06 to T+00:07 — wretched x=object_3, y=object_6, z=object_5, w=object_1
- T+00:07 to T+00:08 — tightfisted x=object_11, y=object_3, z=object_5
- T+00:08 to T+00:09 — sip x=object_9, y=object_0, z=object_5
- T+00:09 to T+00:10 — sip x=object_11, y=object_0, z=object_5
- T+00:10 to T+00:11 — memory x=object_0, y=object_5, z=object_7
- T+00:11 to T+00:12 — paltry x=object_9, y=object_0, z=object_7
- T+00:12 to T+00:13 — paltry x=object_11, y=object_0, z=object_7

Result: Goal satisfied — next(object_10, object_7), next(object_11, object_7), and next(object_9, object_7) all hold.
