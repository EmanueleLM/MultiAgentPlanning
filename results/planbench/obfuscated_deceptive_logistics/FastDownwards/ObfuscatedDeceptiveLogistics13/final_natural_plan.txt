This is the sequence of actions required to achieve the goal state, based on the provided PDDL plan. Each step is assumed to take one unit of time.

| Step | Time | Action Type | Instruction |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 1 | T=1 | **Clip** | Agent **object\_11** performs the Clip action using **object\_5** and **object\_9**. (Establishes vase(object\_11, object\_5)). |
| 2 | T=2 | **Wretched** | Object **object\_5** (Sneeze) performs the Wretched action, moving its 'next' association from **object\_9** to **object\_8**, facilitated by **object\_3** (Stupendous). |
| 3 | T=3 | **Tightfisted** | Agent **object\_11** performs the Tightfisted action, disassembling the vase connection with **object\_5** and establishing a 'next' association with **object\_8**. |
| 4 | T=4 | **Clip** | Agent **object\_12** performs the Clip action using **object\_4** and **object\_6**. (Establishes vase(object\_12, object\_4)). |
| 5 | T=5 | **Sip** | Agent **object\_11** performs the Sip action using **object\_0** and **object\_8**. (Establishes vase(object\_11, object\_0)). |
| 6 | T=6 | **Sip** | Agent **object\_10** performs the Sip action using **object\_0** and **object\_8**. (Establishes vase(object\_10, object\_0)). |
| 7 | T=7 | **Memory** | Object **object\_0** (Cats) performs the Memory action, moving its 'next' association from **object\_8** (Spring) to **object\_6** (Spring). |
| 8 | T=8 | **Paltry** | Agent **object\_11** performs the Paltry action, disassembling the vase connection with **object\_0** and establishing a 'next' association with **object\_6**. |
| 9 | T=9 | **Clip** | Agent **object\_11** performs the Clip action using **object\_4** and **object\_6**. (Establishes vase(object\_11, object\_4)). |
| 10 | T=10 | **Paltry** | Agent **object\_10** performs the Paltry action, disassembling the vase connection with **object\_0** and establishing a 'next' association with **object\_6**. |
| 11 | T=11 | **Clip** | Agent **object\_10** performs the Clip action using **object\_4** and **object\_6**. (Establishes vase(object\_10, object\_4)). |
| 12 | T=12 | **Wretched** | Object **object\_4** (Sneeze) performs the Wretched action, moving its 'next' association from **object\_6** to **object\_7**, facilitated by **object\_2** (Stupendous). |
| 13 | T=13 | **Tightfisted** | Agent **object\_12** performs the Tightfisted action, disassembling the vase connection with **object\_4** and establishing a 'next' association with **object\_7**. |
| 14 | T=14 | **Tightfisted** | Agent **object\_11** performs the Tightfisted action, disassembling the vase connection with **object\_4** and establishing a 'next' association with **object\_7**. |
| 15 | T=15 | **Tightfisted** | Agent **object\_10** performs the Tightfisted action, disassembling the vase connection with **object\_4** and establishing a 'next' association with **object\_7**. |

***
The goal is achieved: objects **object\_10**, **object\_11**, and **object\_12** are now all associated 'next' to **object\_7**.
