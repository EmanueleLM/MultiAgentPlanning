This is the sequence of 22 instructions required to achieve the goal state, derived directly from the PDDL plan:

1. **Clip** `object_10` and `object_4` with respect to `object_8`.
2. **Wretched** linkage of `object_4` from `object_8` to `object_7`, facilitated by `object_2`.
3. **Tightfisted** release of `object_10` from `object_4` to link with `object_7`.
4. **Wretched** linkage of `object_3` from `object_5` to `object_6`, facilitated by `object_1`.
5. **Clip** `object_12` and `object_3` with respect to `object_6`.
6. **Sip** `object_9` and `object_0` with respect to `object_7`.
7. **Sip** `object_10` and `object_0` with respect to `object_7`.
8. **Memory** transfer of `object_0` linkage from `object_7` to `object_5`.
9. **Paltry** release of `object_9` from `object_0` to link with `object_5`.
10. **Sip** `object_11` and `object_0` with respect to `object_5`.
11. **Paltry** release of `object_10` from `object_0` to link with `object_5`.
12. **Wretched** linkage of `object_3` from `object_6` to `object_5`, facilitated by `object_1`.
13. **Clip** `object_9` and `object_3` with respect to `object_5`.
14. **Tightfisted** release of `object_12` from `object_3` to link with `object_5`.
15. **Clip** `object_10` and `object_3` with respect to `object_5`.
16. **Wretched** linkage of `object_3` from `object_5` to `object_6`, facilitated by `object_1`.
17. **Tightfisted** release of `object_9` from `object_3` to link with `object_6`.
18. **Tightfisted** release of `object_10` from `object_3` to link with `object_6`.
19. **Sip** `object_12` and `object_0` with respect to `object_5`.
20. **Memory** transfer of `object_0` linkage from `object_5` to `object_7`.
21. **Paltry** release of `object_12` from `object_0` to link with `object_7`.
22. **Paltry** release of `object_11` from `object_0` to link with `object_7`.
