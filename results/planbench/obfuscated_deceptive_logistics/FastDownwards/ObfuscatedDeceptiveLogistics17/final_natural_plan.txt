Human-readable action sequence (timestamps assume 1 time unit per action)

- 00:00 (duration 1) — clip(object_11, object_5, object_9)
  Bind hand object_11 to sneezy object_5 at textured node object_9; adds vase(object_11, object_5) and removes next(object_11, object_9).

- 00:01 (duration 1) — wretched(object_5, object_9, object_8, object_3)
  Move sneezy object_5 from textured node object_9 to textured node object_8 using stupendous object_3; updates next(object_5, ·) from object_9 to object_8.

- 00:02 (duration 1) — tightfisted(object_11, object_5, object_8)
  Using the vase link with sneezy object_5 now at object_8, place hand object_11 at textured node object_8; adds next(object_11, object_8) and removes vase(object_11, object_5).

- 00:03 (duration 1) — clip(object_10, object_4, object_7)
  Bind hand object_10 to sneezy object_4 at textured node object_7; adds vase(object_10, object_4) and removes next(object_10, object_7).

- 00:04 (duration 1) — sip(object_12, object_1, object_8)
  At textured node object_8 where hand object_12 and cats object_1 co-locate, create vase(object_12, object_1); removes next(object_12, object_8).

- 00:05 (duration 1) — memory(object_1, object_8, object_6)
  Move cats object_1 from spring object_8 to spring object_6; updates next(object_1, ·) from object_8 to object_6.

- 00:06 (duration 1) — wretched(object_4, object_7, object_6, object_2)
  Move sneezy object_4 from textured node object_7 to textured node object_6 using stupendous object_2; updates next(object_4, ·) from object_7 to object_6.

- 00:07 (duration 1) — tightfisted(object_10, object_4, object_6)
  Using the vase link with sneezy object_4 now at object_6, place hand object_10 at textured node object_6; adds next(object_10, object_6) and removes vase(object_10, object_4).

- 00:08 (duration 1) — paltry(object_12, object_1, object_6)
  With vase(object_12, object_1) and cats object_1 next to textured node object_6, place hand object_12 at object_6; adds next(object_12, object_6) and removes vase(object_12, object_1).

- 00:09 (duration 1) — clip(object_12, object_4, object_6)
  Bind hand object_12 to sneezy object_4 at textured node object_6; adds vase(object_12, object_4) and removes next(object_12, object_6).

- 00:10 (duration 1) — wretched(object_4, object_6, object_7, object_2)
  Move sneezy object_4 from textured node object_6 to textured node object_7 using stupendous object_2; updates next(object_4, ·) from object_6 to object_7.

- 00:11 (duration 1) — tightfisted(object_12, object_4, object_7)
  Using the vase link with sneezy object_4 now at object_7, place hand object_12 at textured node object_7; adds next(object_12, object_7) and removes vase(object_12, object_4).

Resulting goal achieved:
- next(object_10, object_6)
- next(object_11, object_8)
- next(object_12, object_7)
- next(object_13, object_9) (unchanged throughout)
