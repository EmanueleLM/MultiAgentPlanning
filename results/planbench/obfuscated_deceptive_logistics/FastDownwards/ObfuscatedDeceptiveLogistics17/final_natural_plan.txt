Below is a clear, step-by-step, human-readable execution of the given PDDL plan. Each step matches the PDDL action exactly (same action name and object arguments), shows a timestamp (start time) and duration (assumed 1.0 time unit each), lists the main preconditions that enabled the action, and shows the immediate effects (what predicate was added and what was removed). The sequence is presented in order and the final goal is shown satisfied at the end.

Step 1 — t=0.0s (duration 1.0)
Action: clip object_11 object_5 object_9
- Preconditions (satisfied before this step): hand(object_11), sneeze(object_5), texture(object_9), next(object_5, object_9), next(object_11, object_9)
- Effects: add vase(object_11, object_5); remove next(object_11, object_9)

Step 2 — t=1.0s (duration 1.0)
Action: wretched object_5 object_9 object_8 object_3
- Preconditions: sneeze(object_5), texture(object_9), texture(object_8), stupendous(object_3), next(object_5, object_9), collect(object_9, object_3), collect(object_8, object_3)
- Effects: add next(object_5, object_8); remove next(object_5, object_9)

Step 3 — t=2.0s (duration 1.0)
Action: tightfisted object_11 object_5 object_8
- Preconditions: hand(object_11), sneeze(object_5), texture(object_8), next(object_5, object_8), vase(object_11, object_5)
- Effects: add next(object_11, object_8); remove vase(object_11, object_5)

Step 4 — t=3.0s (duration 1.0)
Action: clip object_10 object_4 object_7
- Preconditions: hand(object_10), sneeze(object_4), texture(object_7), next(object_4, object_7), next(object_10, object_7)
- Effects: add vase(object_10, object_4); remove next(object_10, object_7)

Step 5 — t=4.0s (duration 1.0)
Action: sip object_12 object_1 object_8
- Preconditions: hand(object_12), cats(object_1), texture(object_8), next(object_12, object_8), next(object_1, object_8)
- Effects: add vase(object_12, object_1); remove next(object_12, object_8)

Step 6 — t=5.0s (duration 1.0)
Action: memory object_1 object_8 object_6
- Preconditions: cats(object_1), spring(object_8), spring(object_6), next(object_1, object_8)
- Effects: add next(object_1, object_6); remove next(object_1, object_8)

Step 7 — t=6.0s (duration 1.0)
Action: paltry object_12 object_1 object_6
- Preconditions: hand(object_12), cats(object_1), texture(object_6), vase(object_12, object_1), next(object_1, object_6)
- Effects: add next(object_12, object_6); remove vase(object_12, object_1)

Step 8 — t=7.0s (duration 1.0)
Action: wretched object_4 object_7 object_6 object_2
- Preconditions: sneeze(object_4), texture(object_7), texture(object_6), stupendous(object_2), next(object_4, object_7), collect(object_7, object_2), collect(object_6, object_2)
- Effects: add next(object_4, object_6); remove next(object_4, object_7)

Step 9 — t=8.0s (duration 1.0)
Action: clip object_12 object_4 object_6
- Preconditions: hand(object_12), sneeze(object_4), texture(object_6), next(object_4, object_6), next(object_12, object_6)
- Effects: add vase(object_12, object_4); remove next(object_12, object_6)

Step 10 — t=9.0s (duration 1.0)
Action: tightfisted object_10 object_4 object_6
- Preconditions: hand(object_10), sneeze(object_4), texture(object_6), next(object_4, object_6), vase(object_10, object_4)
- Effects: add next(object_10, object_6); remove vase(object_10, object_4)

Step 11 — t=10.0s (duration 1.0)
Action: wretched object_4 object_6 object_7 object_2
- Preconditions: sneeze(object_4), texture(object_6), texture(object_7), stupendous(object_2), next(object_4, object_6), collect(object_6, object_2), collect(object_7, object_2)
- Effects: add next(object_4, object_7); remove next(object_4, object_6)

Step 12 — t=11.0s (duration 1.0)
Action: tightfisted object_12 object_4 object_7
- Preconditions: hand(object_12), sneeze(object_4), texture(object_7), next(object_4, object_7), vase(object_12, object_4)
- Effects: add next(object_12, object_7); remove vase(object_12, object_4)

Final state highlights (after Step 12)
- next(object_10, object_6) — achieved by Step 10
- next(object_11, object_8) — achieved by Step 3
- next(object_12, object_7) — achieved by Step 12
- next(object_13, object_9) — unchanged from the initial state

Goal check
- Required goal predicates:
  - next object_10 object_6 — present
  - next object_11 object_8 — present
  - next object_12 object_7 — present
  - next object_13 object_9 — present
All four goal predicates are satisfied by the final state after Step 12.

Notes
- Each step above corresponds exactly to one action in the supplied PDDL plan (12 actions total).
- I assigned 1.0 time unit duration to each action and listed cumulative start times for clarity; the original plan did not specify durations, so these timestamps are illustrative to satisfy the request to report time/duration when possible.
