This plan details the sequence of 11 actions required to achieve the goal state `(next object_11 object_10)`.

1. **Execute Wretched:** Use object 3, moving its association from object 7 to object 6, based on the properties shared with object 1.
   *(Action: wretched object_3 object_7 object_6 object_1)*

2. **Execute Clip:** Use object 11 and object 3 to establish a `vase` connection between them, targeting object 6.
   *(Action: clip object_11 object_3 object_6)*

3. **Execute Wretched:** Use object 3, moving its association from object 6 to object 5, based on the properties shared with object 1.
   *(Action: wretched object_3 object_6 object_5 object_1)*

4. **Execute Tightfisted:** Use object 11 and object 3 to break the `vase` connection and establish a `next` connection for object 11 pointing to object 5.
   *(Action: tightfisted object_11 object_3 object_5)*

5. **Execute Memory:** Use object 0, moving its `next` connection from object 8 to object 5.
   *(Action: memory object_0 object_8 object_5)*

6. **Execute Sip:** Use object 11 and object 0 to establish a `vase` connection between them, targeting object 5. This removes the `next` connection of object 11 to object 5.
   *(Action: sip object_11 object_0 object_5)*

7. **Execute Memory:** Use object 0, moving its `next` connection from object 5 back to object 8.
   *(Action: memory object_0 object_5 object_8)*

8. **Execute Paltry:** Use object 11 and object 0 to break the `vase` connection and establish a `next` connection for object 11 pointing to object 8.
   *(Action: paltry object_11 object_0 object_8)*

9. **Execute Clip:** Use object 11 and object 4 to establish a `vase` connection between them, targeting object 8. This removes the `next` connection of object 11 to object 8.
   *(Action: clip object_11 object_4 object_8)*

10. **Execute Wretched:** Use object 4, moving its association from object 8 to object 10, based on the properties shared with object 2.
    *(Action: wretched object_4 object_8 object_10 object_2)*

11. **Execute Tightfisted:** Use object 11 and object 4 to break the `vase` connection and establish the final required `next` connection for object 11 pointing to object 10.
    *(Action: tightfisted object_11 object_4 object_10)*
