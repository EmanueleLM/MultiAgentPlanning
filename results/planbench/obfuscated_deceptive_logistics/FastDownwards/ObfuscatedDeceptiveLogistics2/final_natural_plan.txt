This plan details the sequence of actions required to achieve the goal state: (next object_7 object_5) and (next object_8 object_5).

| Step | Action | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 1 | **Sip** object_8 object_0 object_6 | Object 8 performs the Sip action involving Object 0 and Object 6. This establishes the relationship (vase object_8 object_0) and removes the connection (next object_8 object_6). |
| 2 | **Sip** object_7 object_0 object_6 | Object 7 performs the Sip action involving Object 0 and Object 6. This establishes the relationship (vase object_7 object_0) and removes the connection (next object_7 object_6). |
| 3 | **Memory** object_0 object_6 object_5 | Object 0 performs the Memory action, changing its link from Object 6 to Object 5. This establishes (next object_0 object_5) and removes (next object_0 object_6). |
| 4 | **Paltry** object_8 object_0 object_5 | Object 8 performs the Paltry action involving Object 0 and Object 5. This establishes the goal relationship (next object_8 object_5) and removes the preceding relationship (vase object_8 object_0). |
| 5 | **Paltry** object_7 object_0 object_5 | Object 7 performs the Paltry action involving Object 0 and Object 5. This establishes the final goal relationship (next object_7 object_5) and removes the relationship (vase object_7 object_0). |
