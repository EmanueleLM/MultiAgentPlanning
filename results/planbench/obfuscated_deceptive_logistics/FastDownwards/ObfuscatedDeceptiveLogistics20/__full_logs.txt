NATURAL-PLAN sas_plan_1
------------------------------
1) [t=0–1, duration 1] (sip object_8 object_1 object_7)
   - Use object_8 (hand) and object_1 (cats) at texture object_7 to create vase(object_8, object_1) and remove next(object_8, object_7).

2) [t=1–2, duration 1] (memory object_1 object_7 object_6)
   - Redirect object_1’s linkage from object_7 to object_6: add next(object_1, object_6) and delete next(object_1, object_7).

3) [t=2–3, duration 1] (paltry object_8 object_1 object_6)
   - Using the vase link and next(object_1, object_6) at texture object_6, set next(object_8, object_6) and remove vase(object_8, object_1).

Result: Goal achieved — next(object_8, object_6).

Here is the human-readable execution of the given plan (unit-duration steps, sequential):

1) t=0.0–1.0 — Execute: sip object_8 object_1 object_7
   - Effect: creates vase(object_8, object_1), removes next(object_8, object_7)

2) t=1.0–2.0 — Execute: memory object_1 object_7 object_6
   - Effect: changes next(object_1, object_7) to next(object_1, object_6)

3) t=2.0–3.0 — Execute: paltry object_8 object_1 object_6
   - Effect: creates next(object_8, object_6), removes vase(object_8, object_1)

Goal achieved: next(object_8, object_6).

NATURAL-PLAN sas_plan_10
------------------------------
Here is the human-readable execution of the given plan, following the actions exactly and in order.

- t=0, duration=1
  Action: memory(object_0, object_6, object_5)
  Description: Redirect object_0’s next-link from object_6 to object_5.
  Effects: add next(object_0, object_5); delete next(object_0, object_6)

- t=1, duration=1
  Action: sip(object_8, object_0, object_5)
  Description: Using object_5 as the textured hub shared by object_8 and object_0, bind them with a vase relation and release object_8’s link to object_5.
  Effects: add vase(object_8, object_0); delete next(object_8, object_5)

- t=2, duration=1
  Action: memory(object_0, object_5, object_6)
  Description: Redirect object_0’s next-link back from object_5 to object_6.
  Effects: add next(object_0, object_6); delete next(object_0, object_5)

- t=3, duration=1
  Action: paltry(object_8, object_0, object_6)
  Description: Using the vase relation between object_8 and object_0 and the texture at object_6, establish object_8’s next-link to object_6 and remove the vase.
  Effects: add next(object_8, object_6); delete vase(object_8, object_0)

Result: Goal achieved — next(object_7, object_6) remains true and next(object_8, object_6) is established.

PROBLEM
------------------------------
I am playing with a set of objects. Here are the actions I can do

Paltry object_0 object_1 object_2.
Sip object_0 object_1 object_2.
Clip object_0 object_1 object_2.
Wretched object_0 object_1 object_2 object_3.
Memory object_0 object_1 object_2.
Tightfisted object_0 object_1 object_2.

I have the following restrictions on my actions:
To perform paltry action, the following facts need to be true: hand object_0, cats object_1, texture object_2, vase object_0 object_1, and next object_1 object_2
Once paltry is performed the following facts will be true: next object_0 object_2
Once paltry is performed the following facts will be false: vase object_0 object_1
To perform sip action, the following facts need to be true: hand object_0, cats object_1, texture object_2, next object_0 object_2, and next object_1 object_2
Once sip is performed the following facts will be true: vase object_0 object_1
Once sip is performed the following facts will be false: next object_0 object_2
To perform clip action, the following facts need to be true: hand object_0, sneeze object_1, texture object_2, next object_1 object_2, and next object_0 object_2

------------------------------
- t=0s (dur=1): memory object_1 object_6 object_7
  Move the cat entity object_1 from being next to object_6 over to object_7 (both are spring-enabled).
  Effects: add next(object_1, object_7); delete next(object_1, object_6).

- t=1s (dur=1): sip object_9 object_1 object_7
  With hand object_9 and cat object_1 both at textured object_7, bind them.
  Effects: add vase(object_9, object_1); delete next(object_9, object_7).

- t=2s (dur=1): memory object_1 object_7 object_6
  Move the cat entity object_1 back from object_7 to object_6.
  Effects: add next(object_1, object_6); delete next(object_1, object_7).

- t=3s (dur=1): paltry object_9 object_1 object_6
  Using the vase link at textured object_6 with cat object_1 present, place object_9 next to object_6 and release the binding.
  Effects: add next(object_9, object_6); delete vase(object_9, object_1).

Result: Goal satisfied — next(object_8, object_7) remains true; next(object_9, object_6) is achieved.

NATURAL-PLAN sas_plan_1
------------------------------
Here is the human-readable execution of the provided plan (unit-duration = 1 time unit per action):

- Step 1 [t=0 → 1, duration 1]: clip(object_9, object_4, object_7)
  Description: With object_9 in hand and both object_4 and object_9 adjacent to object_7, latch object_9 to object_4 (establish vase(object_9, object_4)) and disengage object_9 from object_7.

- Step 2 [t=1 → 2, duration 1]: wretched(object_4, object_7, object_8, object_2)
  Description: Reroute object_4’s adjacency from object_7 to object_8 via the stupendous hub object_2 and the required collections, resulting in next(object_4, object_8) replacing next(object_4, object_7).

- Step 3 [t=2 → 3, duration 1]: tightfisted(object_9, object_4, object_8)
  Description: Using the vase link to object_4 and the fact that object_4 is adjacent to object_8, move object_9 to be adjacent to object_8 (add next(object_9, object_8)) and drop the vase link.

Goal achieved: next(object_9, object_8).

NATURAL-PLAN sas_plan_1
------------------------------
Here is a clear, human-readable execution of the plan. We assume unit-duration actions; timestamps show [start–end] in time units.

1) [0–1] wretched(object_3, object_5, object_6, object_1)
- Effect: Switch next from next(object_3, object_5) to next(object_3, object_6).

2) [1–2] clip(object_9, object_3, object_6)
- Effect: Create vase(object_9, object_3) and remove next(object_9, object_6).

3) [2–3] wretched(object_3, object_6, object_5, object_1)
- Effect: Switch next from next(object_3, object_6) back to next(object_3, object_5).

4) [3–4] tightfisted(object_9, object_3, object_5)
- Effect: Consume vase(object_9, object_3) to establish next(object_9, object_5).

5) [4–5] sip(object_9, object_0, object_5)
- Effect: Create vase(object_9, object_0) and remove next(object_9, object_5).

6) [5–6] memory(object_0, object_5, object_7)
- Effect: Move next from next(object_0, object_5) to next(object_0, object_7).

7) [6–7] paltry(object_9, object_0, object_7)
- Effect: Consume vase(object_9, object_0) to establish next(object_9, object_7).
- Goal A achieved: next(object_9, object_7).

8) [7–8] clip(b_object_10, b_object_5, b_object_9)
- Effect: Create vase(b_object_10, b_object_5) and remove next(b_object_10, b_object_9).

9) [8–9] wretched(b_object_5, b_object_9, b_object_8, b_object_3)
- Effect: Switch next from next(b_object_5, b_object_9) to next(b_object_5, b_object_8).

10) [9–10] tightfisted(b_object_10, b_object_5, b_object_8)
- Effect: Consume vase(b_object_10, b_object_5) to establish next(b_object_10, b_object_8).

11) [10–11] sip(b_object_10, b_object_0, b_object_8)
- Effect: Create vase(b_object_10, b_object_0) and remove next(b_object_10, b_object_8).

12) [11–12] memory(b_object_0, b_object_8, b_object_6)
- Effect: Move next from next(b_object_0, b_object_8) to next(b_object_0, b_object_6).

13) [12–13] paltry(b_object_10, b_object_0, b_object_6)
- Effect: Consume vase(b_object_10, b_object_0) to establish next(b_object_10, b_object_6).
- Goal B achieved: next(b_object_10, b_object_6).

Total duration: 13 time units. Final conjunctive goal satisfied:
- next(object_9, object_7)
- next(b_object_10, b_object_6)

PROBLEM
------------------------------
I am playing with a set of objects. Here are the actions I can do

Paltry object_0 object_1 object_2.
Sip object_0 object_1 object_2.
Clip object_0 object_1 object_2.
Wretched object_0 object_1 object_2 object_3.
Memory object_0 object_1 object_2.
Tightfisted object_0 object_1 object_2.

I have the following restrictions on my actions:
To perform paltry action, the following facts need to be true: hand object_0, cats object_1, texture object_2, vase object_0 object_1, and next object_1 object_2
Once paltry is performed the following facts will be true: next object_0 object_2
Once paltry is performed the following facts will be false: vase object_0 object_1
To perform sip action, the following facts need to be true: hand object_0, cats object_1, texture object_2, next object_0 object_2, and next object_1 object_2
Once sip is performed the following facts will be true: vase object_0 object_1

NATURAL-PLAN sas_plan_1
------------------------------
Here is the human-readable execution of the given plan, step by step, with simple timestamps.

1) t=00:00 (Δt=1)
   clip object_9 object_3 object_5
   - Use hand-held object_9 and sneezing object_3 at textured object_5 (with next object_3 object_5 and next object_9 object_5) to create vase object_9 object_3, removing next object_9 object_5.

2) t=00:01 (Δt=1)
   clip object_10 object_3 object_5
   - Use hand-held object_10 and sneezing object_3 at textured object_5 (with next object_3 object_5 and next object_10 object_5) to create vase object_10 object_3, removing next object_10 object_5.

3) t=00:02 (Δt=1)
   wretched object_3 object_5 object_6 object_1
   - With sneeze object_3, textures at object_5 and object_6, stupendous object_1, and collected links (collect object_5 object_1 and collect object_6 object_1), shift adjacency of object_3 from object_5 to object_6: add next object_3 object_6 and delete next object_3 object_5.

4) t=00:03 (Δt=1)
   tightfisted object_9 object_3 object_6
   - Using vase object_9 object_3 and next object_3 object_6 (with texture object_6), grant next object_9 object_6 and remove vase object_9 object_3.

5) t=00:04 (Δt=1)
   tightfisted object_10 object_3 object_6
   - Using vase object_10 object_3 and next object_3 object_6 (with texture object_6), grant next object_10 object_6 and remove vase object_10 object_3.

Result: Goals achieved — next object_10 object_6 and next object_9 object_6.

- t=00:00 (Δt=1): clip(object_9, object_3, object_5) — binds object_9 to object_3 (vase object_9 object_3), removing next(object_9, object_5).
- t=00:01 (Δt=1): clip(object_10, object_3, object_5) — binds object_10 to object_3 (vase object_10 object_3), removing next(object_10, object_5).
- t=00:02 (Δt=1): wretched(object_3, object_5, object_6, object_1) — moves object_3’s adjacency from object_5 to object_6 (adds next(object_3, object_6), removes next(object_3, object_5)).
- t=00:03 (Δt=1): tightfisted(object_9, object_3, object_6) — uses the vase link to place object_9 next to object_6 (adds next(object_9, object_6), removes vase(object_9, object_3)).
- t=00:04 (Δt=1): tightfisted(object_10, object_3, object_6) — uses the vase link to place object_10 next to object_6 (adds next(object_10, object_6), removes vase(object_10, object_3)).

Result: Goal achieved — next(object_10, object_6) and next(object_9, object_6).

As initial conditions I have that, cats object_0, collect object_5 object_1, collect object_6 object_1, collect object_7 object_2, collect object_8 object_2, hand object_10, hand object_11, hand object_9, next object_0 object_5, next object_10 object_8, next object_11 object_6, next object_3 object_5, next object_4 object_7, next object_9 object_5, sneeze object_3, sneeze object_4, spring object_5, spring object_7, stupendous object_1, stupendous object_2, texture object_5, texture object_6, texture object_7 and texture object_8.
My goal is to have that next object_10 object_7, next object_11 object_7 and next object_9 object_7.

My plan is as follows:

Here is the human-readable execution of the provided plan. Each step matches the plan exactly and uses 1 time unit per action.

- T+00:00 to T+00:01 — wretched x=object_4, y=object_7, z=object_8, w=object_2
- T+00:01 to T+00:02 — clip x=object_10, y=object_4, z=object_8
- T+00:02 to T+00:03 — wretched x=object_4, y=object_8, z=object_7, w=object_2
- T+00:03 to T+00:04 — tightfisted x=object_10, y=object_4, z=object_7
- T+00:04 to T+00:05 — wretched x=object_3, y=object_5, z=object_6, w=object_1
- T+00:05 to T+00:06 — clip x=object_11, y=object_3, z=object_6
- T+00:06 to T+00:07 — wretched x=object_3, y=object_6, z=object_5, w=object_1
- T+00:07 to T+00:08 — tightfisted x=object_11, y=object_3, z=object_5
- T+00:08 to T+00:09 — sip x=object_9, y=object_0, z=object_5
- T+00:09 to T+00:10 — sip x=object_11, y=object_0, z=object_5
- T+00:10 to T+00:11 — memory x=object_0, y=object_5, z=object_7

Inputs you must use: operators={operators_spec} instances={instances_spec} validation={plan_analysis}.

Here is the human-readable execution trace that follows the plan exactly and achieves the goal (next object_10 object_7, next object_11 object_9, next object_12 object_8). Each step uses unit time; timestamps increase by 1.

- T+00 (dur=1): WRETCHED(o0=object_5, o1=object_8, o2=object_9, o3=object_3) — Switch object_5’s adjacency from object_8 to object_9 (via stupendous object_3 and valid collects).
- T+01 (dur=1): CLIP(o0=object_10, o1=object_5, o2=object_9) — Couple hand object_10 with sneezer object_5 at location object_9 (create vase(10,5), drop next(10,9)).
- T+02 (dur=1): WRETCHED(o0=object_4, o1=object_7, o2=object_6, o3=object_2) — Switch object_4’s adjacency from object_7 to object_6 (via stupendous object_2 and valid collects).
- T+03 (dur=1): SIP(o0=object_12, o1=object_0, o2=object_6) — Couple hand object_12 with cat object_0 at location object_6 (create vase(12,0), drop next(12,6)).
- T+04 (dur=1): SIP(o0=object_11, o1=object_0, o2=object_6) — Couple hand object_11 with cat object_0 at location object_6 (create vase(11,0), drop next(11,6)).
- T+05 (dur=1): WRETCHED(o0=object_5, o1=object_9, o2=object_8, o3=object_3) — Switch object_5’s adjacency from object_9 back to object_8 (via stupendous object_3 and valid collects).
- T+06 (dur=1): TIGHTFISTED(o0=object_10, o1=object_5, o2=object_8) — Move hand object_10 with sneezer object_5 to object_8 and release (add next(10,8), delete vase(10,5)).
- T+07 (dur=1): SIP(o0=object_10, o1=object_1, o2=object_8) — Couple hand object_10 with cat object_1 at location object_8 (create vase(10,1), drop next(10,8)).
- T+08 (dur=1): MEMORY(o0=object_1, o1=object_8, o2=object_6) — Repoint cat object_1’s adjacency from object_8 to object_6.
- T+09 (dur=1): PALTRY(o0=object_10, o1=object_1, o2=object_6) — Move hand object_10 (with cat object_1) to object_6 and release (add next(10,6), delete vase(10,1)).
- T+10 (dur=1): CLIP(o0=object_10, o1=object_4, o2=object_6) — Couple hand object_10 with sneezer object_4 at location object_6 (create vase(10,4), drop next(10,6)).
- T+11 (dur=1): WRETCHED(o0=object_4, o1=object_6, o2=object_7, o3=object_2) — Switch object_4’s adjacency from object_6 to object_7 (via stupendous object_2 and valid collects).
- T+12 (dur=1): TIGHTFISTED(o0=object_10, o1=object_4, o2=object_7) — Move hand object_10 with sneezer object_4 to object_7 and release (add next(10,7), delete vase(10,4)).
- T+13 (dur=1): MEMORY(o0=object_0, o1=object_6, o2=object_8) — Repoint cat object_0’s adjacency from object_6 to object_8.
- T+14 (dur=1): PALTRY(o0=object_12, o1=object_0, o2=object_8) — Move hand object_12 (with cat object_0) to object_8 and release (add next(12,8), delete vase(12,0)).
- T+15 (dur=1): PALTRY(o0=object_11, o1=object_0, o2=object_8) — Move hand object_11 (with cat object_0) to object_8 and release (add next(11,8), delete vase(11,0)).
- T+16 (dur=1): CLIP(o0=object_11, o1=object_5, o2=object_8) — Couple hand object_11 with sneezer object_5 at location object_8 (create vase(11,5), drop next(11,8)).
- T+17 (dur=1): WRETCHED(o0=object_5, o1=object_8, o2=object_9, o3=object_3) — Switch object_5’s adjacency from object_8 to object_9 (via stupendous object_3 and valid collects).

Here is a clear, step-by-step translation of the provided PDDL plan into human-readable actions. Each step preserves the exact action and arguments from the plan, with a timestamp and duration, plus a concise summary of its key effects.

1) t=0–1 (duration 1): wretched object_5 object_8 object_9 object_3
   - adds (next object_5 object_9); deletes (next object_5 object_8)

2) t=1–2 (duration 1): clip object_10 object_5 object_9
   - adds (vase object_10 object_5); deletes (next object_10 object_9)

3) t=2–3 (duration 1): wretched object_4 object_7 object_6 object_2
   - adds (next object_4 object_6); deletes (next object_4 object_7)

FINAL-PLAN
------------------------------
I’m missing the two crucial inputs needed to build the PDDL:

- action_model_summary: the exact predicates plus the six actions paltry, sip, clip, wretched, memory, tightfisted with their parameters, preconditions, and add/delete effects.
- scenario_b_facts: the complete initial state facts and goal facts for Scenario B, plus any object typing information (or confirmation to use a single type).

Please provide:
1) The full predicate list (names and argument schemas).
2) For each of the six actions: parameters, preconditions, add effects, delete effects (no negative preconditions unless explicitly required).
3) Scenario B: list of objects (or confirm object_0 … object_12), initial facts, and goal facts.
4) Any type declarations (or confirm a single type object).

Once I have those, I will produce a single Fast Downward–compatible STRIPS domain and one problem file wrapped in <domain></domain> and <problem></problem> tags.

My plan is as follows:

[PLAN]
================================================================================


FINAL-PLAN
------------------------------
I’m missing two critical pieces to produce the exact STRIPS PDDL you requested:

1) The action model: the six operators’ exact names, parameters, preconditions (including any negative preconditions), and effects (add and delete lists), restricted to the given predicates:
- Unary: hand, cats, sneeze, spring, stupendous, texture
- Binary: vase, next, collect

2) Scenario 2 (public information): the complete list of initial facts and the goal facts, expressed only with the above predicates and the objects object_0 … object_13.

Without these, I would have to invent content, which you explicitly prohibited. Please provide:

- For each of the six actions:
  - :action name
  - :parameters (using only objects; no types)
  - :precondition (conjunction of literals; allow negatives if needed)
  - :effect (add/delete lists)
- Scenario 2 initial state:
  - All true unary facts, e.g., (hand object_k), (cats object_m), etc.
  - All true binary facts, e.g., (vase object_i object_j), (next object_x object_y), (collect object_p object_q)
- Scenario 2 goals:
  - Full list of goal literals (positive and, if applicable, negative)

Notes:
- I will set :requirements to exactly (:strips :negative-preconditions) as requested (no typing).
- I won’t introduce any new predicates or features and won’t output a plan.
- If Scenario 2 contains any “avoid/would rather/earliest” preferences, please translate them into exact state goals or required (negative) literals, since we cannot encode temporal/trajectory constraints in STRIPS with the fixed predicate set.

  Using the vase link with sneezy object_4 now at object_6, place hand object_10 at textured node object_6; adds next(object_10, object_6) and removes vase(object_10, object_4).

- 00:08 (duration 1) — paltry(object_12, object_1, object_6)
  With vase(object_12, object_1) and cats object_1 next to textured node object_6, place hand object_12 at object_6; adds next(object_12, object_6) and removes vase(object_12, object_1).

- 00:09 (duration 1) — clip(object_12, object_4, object_6)
  Bind hand object_12 to sneezy object_4 at textured node object_6; adds vase(object_12, object_4) and removes next(object_12, object_6).

- 00:10 (duration 1) — wretched(object_4, object_6, object_7, object_2)
  Move sneezy object_4 from textured node object_6 to textured node object_7 using stupendous object_2; updates next(object_4, ·) from object_6 to object_7.

- 00:11 (duration 1) — tightfisted(object_12, object_4, object_7)
  Using the vase link with sneezy object_4 now at object_7, place hand object_12 at textured node object_7; adds next(object_12, object_7) and removes vase(object_12, object_4).

Resulting goal achieved:

Paltry requires a vase(11, x) with cats(x) and next(x,10); only cats object is object_0, but next object_0 object_10 cannot be made (spring 10 is absent, and object_0 is not sneeze). Tightfisted requires a vase(11, y) with sneeze(y) and next(y,10); while object_4 can reach next 4 10 via wretched (using stupendous 2), we cannot create vase(11,4) because no shared next with object_11 exists initially or can be created without an existing vase. The only initial vase that can be formed is vase(11,3) via clip after setting next 3 6, but object_3 cannot reach 10 due to collection constraints (no o3 collecting both 6 and 10). Minimal addition to make it solvable: add collect object_6 object_2, enabling wretched object_3 object_6 object_10 object_2; then a feasible plan exists:\n- wretched object_3 object_7 object_6 object_1\n- clip object_11 object_3 object_6\n- wretched object_3 object_6 object_10 object_2\n- tightfisted object_11 object_3 object_10"

NATURAL-PLAN sas_plan_1
------------------------------
Here is the human-readable version of the given plan. Each step lists the action name and its parameters exactly as in the plan, with a short description and a unit-time schedule (1 time unit per action).

1) t=0–1
- Action: clip object_11 object_5 object_9
- What it does: Using object_11 with object_5 at relation to object_9, create a vase link between object_11 and object_5, removing next(object_11, object_9).

2) t=1–2
- Action: wretched object_5 object_9 object_8 object_3
- What it does: Redirect object_5’s relation from next(object_5, object_9) to next(object_5, object_8) using the stupendous hub object_3 and the required collections.

3) t=2–3
- Action: tightfisted object_11 object_5 object_8
- What it does: From the vase(object_11, object_5) and next(object_5, object_8), establish next(object_11, object_8) and remove the vase link.

4) t=3–4
- Action: clip object_10 object_4 object_7
- What it does: Using object_10 with object_4 at relation to object_7, create vase(object_10, object_4), removing next(object_10, object_7).

5) t=4–5
- Action: sip object_12 object_1 object_8
- What it does: With object_12 and object_1 both related to object_8, create vase(object_12, object_1) and remove next(object_12, object_8).

6) t=5–6
- Action: memory object_1 object_8 object_6
- What it does: Shift object_1’s relation from next(object_1, object_8) to next(object_1, object_6) using spring objects 8 and 6.

7) t=6–7
- Action: wretched object_4 object_7 object_6 object_2
- What it does: Redirect object_4’s relation from next(object_4, object_7) to next(object_4, object_6) using stupendous object_2 and the required collections.

8) t=7–8
- Action: tightfisted object_10 object_4 object_6
- What it does: From vase(object_10, object_4) and next(object_4, object_6), establish next(object_10, object_6) and remove the vase link.

9) t=8–9
- Action: paltry object_12 object_1 object_6
- What it does: Using the vase(object_12, object_1) and next(object_1, object_6), establish next(object_12, object_6) and remove the vase link.

10) t=9–10
- Action: clip object_12 object_4 object_6
- What it does: With object_12 and object_4 both related to object_6, create vase(object_12, object_4), removing next(object_12, object_6).

11) t=10–11
- Action: wretched object_4 object_6 object_7 object_2
- What it does: Redirect object_4’s relation from next(object_4, object_6) back to next(object_4, object_7) using stupendous object_2.

12) t=11–12
- Action: tightfisted object_12 object_4 object_7
- What it does: From vase(object_12, object_4) and next(object_4, object_7), establish next(object_12, object_7) and remove the vase link.

Final goals satisfied at t=12:
- next(object_10, object_6)
- next(object_11, object_8)
- next(object_12, object_7)
- next(object_13, object_9) (this one was already true initially and remains true)

Here is the human-readable execution of the plan, following the given action sequence exactly. Each step takes 1 time unit.

1) t=0–1 (duration 1): wretched object_3 object_7 object_6 object_1
   - Re-route next for object_3 from object_7 to object_6 (using stupendous object_1 and required collects).

2) t=1–2 (duration 1): clip object_11 object_3 object_6
   - Form vase(object_11, object_3) at texture object_6; remove next(object_11, object_6).

3) t=2–3 (duration 1): wretched object_3 object_6 object_5 object_1
   - Re-route next for object_3 from object_6 to object_5 (using stupendous object_1 and required collects).

4) t=3–4 (duration 1): tightfisted object_11 object_3 object_5
   - Use vase(object_11, object_3) and next(object_3, object_5) to set next(object_11, object_5); remove vase(object_11, object_3).

5) t=4–5 (duration 1): memory object_0 object_8 object_5
   - Move next for cats object_0 from object_8 to object_5.

6) t=5–6 (duration 1): sip object_11 object_0 object_5
   - Create vase(object_11, object_0) via shared next(..., object_5); remove next(object_11, object_5).

7) t=6–7 (duration 1): memory object_0 object_5 object_8
   - Move next for cats object_0 from object_5 back to object_8.

8) t=7–8 (duration 1): paltry object_11 object_0 object_8
   - Use vase(object_11, object_0) and next(object_0, object_8) to set next(object_11, object_8); remove vase(object_11, object_0).

9) t=8–9 (duration 1): clip object_11 object_4 object_8
   - Form vase(object_11, object_4) at texture object_8; remove next(object_11, object_8).

10) t=9–10 (duration 1): wretched object_4 object_8 object_10 object_2
    - Re-route next for object_4 from object_8 to object_10 (using stupendous object_2 and required collects).

11) t=10–11 (duration 1): tightfisted object_11 object_4 object_10
    - Use vase(object_11, object_4) and next(object_4, object_10) to set next(object_11, object_10); remove vase(object_11, object_4).

Goal achieved: next(object_11, object_10).

[PLAN]
================================================================================


FINAL-PLAN
------------------------------
I’m missing the analysts’ “public information” that specifies the exact preconditions and effects for the six actions and the Facts/Goal for each scenario. I can’t safely invent those without violating your constraints. Please provide:

1) Action schemas (must use only the predicates: hand, cats, texture, vase, next, sneeze, spring, stupendous, collect)
- For each action: paltry, sip, clip, wretched, memory, tightfisted
  - Preconditions: list of ground/lifted literals (allowing negated preconditions if intended)
  - Effects: add list and delete list (no conditionals, no quantifiers, no numeric fluents)

2) Scenario S1
- Full object list used in the scenario (I can also include object_0 through object_12 if you want them present)
- Initial state: complete set of true ground atoms over the allowed predicates
- Goal: conjunction of goal literals over the allowed predicates (specify if any negated goals are required)
- Any ordering/temporal preferences that must be enforced as hard constraints (I’ll encode these via additional predicates/preconditions)

3) Scenario S2
- Same details as S1: objects, initial facts, goal, and any hard ordering constraints

4) Typing
- If you need multiple types, list the types and each object’s type; otherwise I will use a single universal type “thing” with :typing enabled.

Once I have these details, I’ll produce one STRIPS-compatible domain and two solvable problems (scenario_s1 and scenario_s2) with exactly the six actions and only the specified predicates, suitable for FastDownward.

NATURAL-PLAN sas_plan_10
------------------------------
Here is the human-readable sequence of actions that follows the plan exactly and reaches the goal next object_11 object_9.

1) t=0 to t=1 (duration 1)
   Action: wretched object_4 object_10 object_8 object_2
   Effect: Redirect next for object_4 from object_10 to object_8 (remove next object_4 object_10; add next object_4 object_8).

2) t=1 to t=2 (duration 1)
   Action: clip object_11 object_4 object_8
   Effect: Create a vase link between object_11 and object_4 and clear next from object_11 to object_8 (add vase object_11 object_4; remove next object_11 object_8).

3) t=2 to t=3 (duration 1)
   Action: wretched object_4 object_8 object_9 object_2
   Effect: Redirect next for object_4 from object_8 to object_9 (remove next object_4 object_8; add next object_4 object_9).

4) t=3 to t=4 (duration 1)
   Action: tightfisted object_11 object_4 object_9
   Effect: Use the vase link to establish next from object_11 to object_9 and then remove the vase link (add next object_11 object_9; remove vase object_11 object_4).

Goal achieved: next object_11 object_9.
