This is the sequence of human-readable actions required to achieve the desired state:

| Step | Action | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 1 | **CLIP** object\_12, object\_5, object\_11 | Handheld Object 12 interacts with sneezing Object 5 and textured Object 11, establishing a `vase` connection between Object 12 and Object 5, and simultaneously removing the `next` relationship between Object 12 and Object 11. |
| 2 | **WRETCHED** object\_5, object\_11, object\_10, object\_3 | Sneezing Object 5 switches its `next` relationship from textured Object 11 to textured Object 10, utilizing stupendous Object 3 as the common container for collection. |
| 3 | **TIGHTFISTED** object\_12, object\_5, object\_10 | Handheld Object 12 interacts with sneezing Object 5 and textured Object 10, removing the `vase` connection between Object 12 and Object 5, and establishing a `next` relationship between Object 12 and Object 10. (Goal 1 achieved: `next object_12 object_10`) |
| 4 | **WRETCHED** object\_4, object\_8, object\_6, object\_2 | Sneezing Object 4 switches its `next` relationship from textured Object 8 to textured Object 6, utilizing stupendous Object 2 as the common container for collection. |
| 5 | **WRETCHED** object\_4, object\_6, object\_7, object\_2 | Sneezing Object 4 switches its `next` relationship from textured Object 6 to textured Object 7, utilizing stupendous Object 2 as the common container for collection. |
| 6 | **CLIP** object\_13, object\_4, object\_7 | Handheld Object 13 interacts with sneezing Object 4 and textured Object 7, establishing a `vase` connection between Object 13 and Object 4, and simultaneously removing the `next` relationship between Object 13 and Object 7. |
| 7 | **WRETCHED** object\_4, object\_7, object\_6, object\_2 | Sneezing Object 4 switches its `next` relationship from textured Object 7 to textured Object 6, utilizing stupendous Object 2 as the common container for collection. |
| 8 | **TIGHTFISTED** object\_13, object\_4, object\_6 | Handheld Object 13 interacts with sneezing Object 4 and textured Object 6, removing the `vase` connection between Object 13 and Object 4, and establishing a `next` relationship between Object 13 and Object 6. |
| 9 | **MEMORY** object\_0, object\_9, object\_6 | Cats Object 0 switches its `next` relationship from spring Object 9 to spring Object 6. |
| 10 | **SIP** object\_13, object\_0, object\_6 | Handheld Object 13 interacts with cats Object 0 and textured Object 6, establishing a `vase` connection between Object 13 and Object 0, and simultaneously removing the `next` relationship between Object 13 and Object 6. |
| 11 | **MEMORY** object\_0, object\_6, object\_9 | Cats Object 0 switches its `next` relationship from spring Object 6 back to spring Object 9. |
| 12 | **PALTRY** object\_13, object\_0, object\_9 | Handheld Object 13 interacts with cats Object 0 and textured Object 9, removing the `vase` connection between Object 13 and Object 0, and establishing a `next` relationship between Object 13 and Object 9. (Goal 2 achieved: `next object_13 object_9`) |
