Action sequence (18 steps), following the provided plan exactly. Each action assumed to take duration 1 time unit.

1) [t=0, dur=1] Clip object_13 to object_4 at textured object_7.
   - Effect: create vase(object_13, object_4); remove next(object_13, object_7).

2) [t=1, dur=1] Clip object_12 to object_4 at textured object_7.
   - Effect: create vase(object_12, object_4); remove next(object_12, object_7).

3) [t=2, dur=1] Wretched: reroute sneezing object_4 from texture object_7 to texture object_10 using stupendous object_2.
   - Effect: remove next(object_4, object_7); add next(object_4, object_10).

4) [t=3, dur=1] Tightfisted: advance object_13 via its vase link to object_4 along texture object_10.

6) [t=5, dur=1] Wretched: reroute sneezing object_4 from texture object_10 to texture object_6 using stupendous object_2.
   - Effect: remove next(object_4, object_10); add next(object_4, object_6).

7) [t=6, dur=1] Tightfisted: advance object_12 via its vase link to object_4 along texture object_6.

   - Goal progress: achieves next(object_12, object_6).

8) [t=7, dur=1] Wretched: reroute sneezing object_4 from texture object_6 to texture object_8 using stupendous object_2.
   - Effect: remove next(object_4, object_6); add next(object_4, object_8).

9) [t=8, dur=1] Clip object_12 to object_4 at textured object_11.
   - Effect: create vase(object_12, object_4); remove next(object_12, object_11).

10) [t=9, dur=1] Clip object_14 to object_4 at textured object_8.
    - Effect: create vase(object_14, object_4); remove next(object_14, object_8).

11) [t=10, dur=1] Tightfisted: advance object_14 via its vase link to object_4 along texture object_11.
    - Effect: remove vase(object_14, object_4); add next(object_14, object_11).
    - Goal progress: achieves next(object_14, object_11).

12) [t=11, dur=1] Wretched: reroute sneezing object_4 from texture object_8 to texture object_9 using stupendous object_2.
    - Effect: remove next(object_4, object_8); add next(object_4, object_9).

13) [t=12, dur=1] Tightfisted: advance object_12 via its vase link to object_4 along texture object_9.
    - Effect: remove vase(object_12, object_4); add next(object_12, object_9).
    - Goal progress: achieves next(object_12, object_9).

14) [t=13, dur=1] Wretched: reroute sneezing object_3 from texture object_6 to texture object_10 using stupendous object_2.
    - Effect: remove next(object_3, object_6); add next(object_3, object_10).

15) [t=14, dur=1] Clip object_11 to object_3 at textured object_10.
    - Effect: create vase(object_11, object_3); remove next(object_11, object_10).

16) [t=15, dur=1] Wretched: reroute sneezing object_3 from texture object_10 to texture object_7 using stupendous object_2.
    - Effect: remove next(object_3, object_10); add next(object_3, object_7).
