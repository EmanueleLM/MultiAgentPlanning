This is the sequence of human-readable instructions derived from the PDDL plan for the Obfuscated Deceptive Logistics scenario.

| Step | Time | Action | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 1 | T=1 | **Memory object\_1 object\_6 object\_7** | Execute the **Memory** procedure, linking Object 1 from Object 6 to Object 7. (Effect: establishes `next object_1 object_7` and removes `next object_1 object_6`). |
| 2 | T=2 | **Sip object\_9 object\_1 object\_7** | Execute the **Sip** procedure, using Object 9, Object 1, and Object 7. (Effect: establishes the container relationship `vase object_9 object_1` and removes `next object_9 object_7`). |
| 3 | T=3 | **Memory object\_1 object\_7 object\_6** | Execute the **Memory** procedure again, linking Object 1 from Object 7 back to Object 6. (Effect: establishes `next object_1 object_6` and removes `next object_1 object_7`). |
| 4 | T=4 | **Paltry object\_9 object\_1 object\_6** | Execute the **Paltry** procedure, using Object 9, Object 1, and Object 6. (Effect: establishes the final required link `next object_9 object_6` and removes `vase object_9 object_1`). |

The final state satisfies the goal: `(next object_8 object_7)` and `(next object_9 object_6)`.
