Here is the human-readable execution of the provided plan (unit-duration = 1 time unit per action):

- Step 1 [t=0 → 1, duration 1]: clip(object_9, object_4, object_7)
  Description: With object_9 in hand and both object_4 and object_9 adjacent to object_7, latch object_9 to object_4 (establish vase(object_9, object_4)) and disengage object_9 from object_7.

- Step 2 [t=1 → 2, duration 1]: wretched(object_4, object_7, object_8, object_2)
  Description: Reroute object_4’s adjacency from object_7 to object_8 via the stupendous hub object_2 and the required collections, resulting in next(object_4, object_8) replacing next(object_4, object_7).

- Step 3 [t=2 → 3, duration 1]: tightfisted(object_9, object_4, object_8)
  Description: Using the vase link to object_4 and the fact that object_4 is adjacent to object_8, move object_9 to be adjacent to object_8 (add next(object_9, object_8)) and drop the vase link.

Goal achieved: next(object_9, object_8).
