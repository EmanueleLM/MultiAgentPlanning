This plan translates the PDDL actions into a clear sequence of human-readable instructions designed to achieve the final linkage condition: `(next object_9 object_7)`.

| Step | Action and Parameters | Description of Action |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **1** | **Wretched** (object\_3, object\_5, object\_6, object\_1) | Execute the Wretched maneuver: Re-route the linkage of object\_3 from object\_5 to object\_6. This action is facilitated by the shared collector (object\_1) and required properties of object\_3 (sneeze) and the texture of object\_5 and object\_6. |
| **2** | **Clip** (object\_9, object\_3, object\_6) | Execute the Clip action: Using the held object\_9, establish a 'vase' connection between object\_9 and object\_3, referencing texture object\_6. This simultaneously breaks the current `next` linkage for object\_9 (which was linking it to object\_6). |
| **3** | **Wretched** (object\_3, object\_6, object\_5, object\_1) | Execute the Wretched maneuver again: Re-route the linkage of object\_3 back from object\_6 to object\_5, utilizing the shared collector object\_1. |
| **4** | **Tightfisted** (object\_9, object\_3, object\_5) | Perform the Tightfisted action: Use object\_9 and object\_3, directed towards texture object\_5. This breaks the existing 'vase' connection between object\_9 and object\_3, establishing a new `next` link from object\_9 to object\_5. |
| **5** | **Sip** (object\_9, object\_0, object\_5) | Execute the Sip action: Using the held object\_9, establish a 'vase' connection between object\_9 and object\_0, referencing texture object\_5. This simultaneously breaks the `next` link that object\_9 had established with object\_5. |
| **6** | **Memory** (object\_0, object\_5, object\_7) | Apply the Memory maneuver: Re-route the linkage of the 'cats' object\_0 from spring object\_5 to spring object\_7. |
| **7** | **Paltry** (object\_9, object\_0, object\_7) | Perform the Paltry action: Use the held object\_9 and 'cats' object\_0, directed towards texture object\_7. This breaks the 'vase' connection and successfully establishes the final goal linkage: **(next object\_9 object\_7)**. |
