Here is a clear, human-readable execution of the plan. We assume unit-duration actions; timestamps show [start–end] in time units.

1) [0–1] wretched(object_3, object_5, object_6, object_1)
- Effect: Switch next from next(object_3, object_5) to next(object_3, object_6).

2) [1–2] clip(object_9, object_3, object_6)
- Effect: Create vase(object_9, object_3) and remove next(object_9, object_6).

3) [2–3] wretched(object_3, object_6, object_5, object_1)
- Effect: Switch next from next(object_3, object_6) back to next(object_3, object_5).

4) [3–4] tightfisted(object_9, object_3, object_5)
- Effect: Consume vase(object_9, object_3) to establish next(object_9, object_5).

5) [4–5] sip(object_9, object_0, object_5)
- Effect: Create vase(object_9, object_0) and remove next(object_9, object_5).

6) [5–6] memory(object_0, object_5, object_7)
- Effect: Move next from next(object_0, object_5) to next(object_0, object_7).

7) [6–7] paltry(object_9, object_0, object_7)
- Effect: Consume vase(object_9, object_0) to establish next(object_9, object_7).
- Goal A achieved: next(object_9, object_7).

8) [7–8] clip(b_object_10, b_object_5, b_object_9)
- Effect: Create vase(b_object_10, b_object_5) and remove next(b_object_10, b_object_9).

9) [8–9] wretched(b_object_5, b_object_9, b_object_8, b_object_3)
- Effect: Switch next from next(b_object_5, b_object_9) to next(b_object_5, b_object_8).

10) [9–10] tightfisted(b_object_10, b_object_5, b_object_8)
- Effect: Consume vase(b_object_10, b_object_5) to establish next(b_object_10, b_object_8).

11) [10–11] sip(b_object_10, b_object_0, b_object_8)
- Effect: Create vase(b_object_10, b_object_0) and remove next(b_object_10, b_object_8).

12) [11–12] memory(b_object_0, b_object_8, b_object_6)
- Effect: Move next from next(b_object_0, b_object_8) to next(b_object_0, b_object_6).

13) [12–13] paltry(b_object_10, b_object_0, b_object_6)
- Effect: Consume vase(b_object_10, b_object_0) to establish next(b_object_10, b_object_6).
- Goal B achieved: next(b_object_10, b_object_6).

Total duration: 13 time units. Final conjunctive goal satisfied:
- next(object_9, object_7)
- next(b_object_10, b_object_6)
