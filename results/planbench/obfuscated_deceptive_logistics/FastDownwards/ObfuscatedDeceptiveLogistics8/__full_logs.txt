This is the sequence of human-readable instructions derived from the PDDL plan for the Obfuscated Deceptive Logistics scenario.

| Step | Time | Action | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 1 | T=1 | **Memory object\_1 object\_6 object\_7** | Execute the **Memory** procedure, linking Object 1 from Object 6 to Object 7. (Effect: establishes `next object_1 object_7` and removes `next object_1 object_6`). |
| 2 | T=2 | **Sip object\_9 object\_1 object\_7** | Execute the **Sip** procedure, using Object 9, Object 1, and Object 7. (Effect: establishes the container relationship `vase object_9 object_1` and removes `next object_9 object_7`). |
| 3 | T=3 | **Memory object\_1 object\_7 object\_6** | Execute the **Memory** procedure again, linking Object 1 from Object 7 back to Object 6. (Effect: establishes `next object_1 object_6` and removes `next object_1 object_7`). |
| 4 | T=4 | **Paltry object\_9 object\_1 object\_6** | Execute the **Paltry** procedure, using Object 9, Object 1, and Object 6. (Effect: establishes the final required link `next object_9 object_6` and removes `vase object_9 object_1`). |

The final state satisfies the goal: `(next object_8 object_7)` and `(next object_9 object_6)`.

Once paltry is performed the following facts will be true: next object_0 object_2
Once paltry is performed the following facts will be false: vase object_0 object_1
To perform sip action, the following facts need to be true: hand object_0, cats object_1, texture object_2, next object_0 object_2, and next object_1 object_2
Once sip is performed the following facts will be true: vase object_0 object_1
Once sip is performed the following facts will be false: next object_0 object_2
To perform clip action, the following facts need to be true: hand object_0, sneeze object_1, texture object_2, next object_1 object_2, and next object_0 object_2
Once clip is performed the following facts will be true: vase object_0 object_1
Once clip is performed the following facts will be false: next object_0 object_2
To perform wretched action, the following facts need to be true: sneeze object_0, texture object_1, texture object_2, stupendous object_3, next object_0 object_1, collect object_1 object_3, and collect object_2 object_3
Once wretched is performed the following facts will be true: next object_0 object_2

NATURAL-PLAN sas_plan_1
------------------------------
This is the sequence of human-readable actions required to achieve the goal:

| Step | Time | Action | Details |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 1 | T=0:00 | **CLIP** | Use Object 9, Object 4, and Object 7. This establishes the `(vase object_9 object_4)` state, removing the previous link `(next object_9 object_7)`. |
| 2 | T=0:01 | **WRETCHED** | Use Object 4, Object 7, Object 8, and Object 2. This action re-establishes a sequential link for Object 4, setting `(next object_4 object_8)`, and removing the link `(next object_4 object_7)`. |
| 3 | T=0:02 | **TIGHTFISTED** | Use Object 9, Object 4, and Object 8. This action achieves the goal state `(next object_9 object_8)` by leveraging the intermediate `(vase object_9 object_4)` and `(next object_4 object_8)` states. It also removes the `(vase object_9 object_4)` state. |

**Goal Achieved:** `(next object_9 object_8)` is established.

NATURAL-PLAN sas_plan_1
------------------------------
This plan translates the PDDL actions into a clear sequence of human-readable instructions designed to achieve the final linkage condition: `(next object_9 object_7)`.

| Step | Action and Parameters | Description of Action |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **1** | **Wretched** (object\_3, object\_5, object\_6, object\_1) | Execute the Wretched maneuver: Re-route the linkage of object\_3 from object\_5 to object\_6. This action is facilitated by the shared collector (object\_1) and required properties of object\_3 (sneeze) and the texture of object\_5 and object\_6. |
| **2** | **Clip** (object\_9, object\_3, object\_6) | Execute the Clip action: Using the held object\_9, establish a 'vase' connection between object\_9 and object\_3, referencing texture object\_6. This simultaneously breaks the current `next` linkage for object\_9 (which was linking it to object\_6). |
| **3** | **Wretched** (object\_3, object\_6, object\_5, object\_1) | Execute the Wretched maneuver again: Re-route the linkage of object\_3 back from object\_6 to object\_5, utilizing the shared collector object\_1. |
| **4** | **Tightfisted** (object\_9, object\_3, object\_5) | Perform the Tightfisted action: Use object\_9 and object\_3, directed towards texture object\_5. This breaks the existing 'vase' connection between object\_9 and object\_3, establishing a new `next` link from object\_9 to object\_5. |
| **5** | **Sip** (object\_9, object\_0, object\_5) | Execute the Sip action: Using the held object\_9, establish a 'vase' connection between object\_9 and object\_0, referencing texture object\_5. This simultaneously breaks the `next` link that object\_9 had established with object\_5. |
| **6** | **Memory** (object\_0, object\_5, object\_7) | Apply the Memory maneuver: Re-route the linkage of the 'cats' object\_0 from spring object\_5 to spring object\_7. |
| **7** | **Paltry** (object\_9, object\_0, object\_7) | Perform the Paltry action: Use the held object\_9 and 'cats' object\_0, directed towards texture object\_7. This breaks the 'vase' connection and successfully establishes the final goal linkage: **(next object\_9 object\_7)**. |

Clip object_0 object_1 object_2.
Wretched object_0 object_1 object_2 object_3.
Memory object_0 object_1 object_2.
Tightfisted object_0 object_1 object_2.

I have the following restrictions on my actions:
To perform paltry action, the following facts need to be true: hand object_0, cats object_1, texture object_2, vase object_0 object_1, and next object_1 object_2
Once paltry is performed the following facts will be true: next object_0 object_2
Once paltry is performed the following facts will be false: vase object_0 object_1
To perform sip action, the following facts need to be true: hand object_0, cats object_1, texture object_2, next object_0 object_2, and next object_1 object_2
Once sip is performed the following facts will be true: vase object_0 object_1
Once sip is performed the following facts will be false: next object_0 object_2
To perform clip action, the following facts need to be true: hand object_0, sneeze object_1, texture object_2, next object_1 object_2, and next object_0 object_2
Once clip is performed the following facts will be true: vase object_0 object_1
Once clip is performed the following facts will be false: next object_0 object_2
To perform wretched action, the following facts need to be true: sneeze object_0, texture object_1, texture object_2, stupendous object_3, next object_0 object_1, collect object_1 object_3, and collect object_2 object_3
Once wretched is performed the following facts will be true: next object_0 object_2
Once wretched is performed the following facts will be false: next object_0 object_1
To perform memory action, the following facts need to be true: cats object_0, spring object_1, spring object_2, and next object_0 object_1

Once tightfisted is performed the following facts will be true: next object_0 object_2
Once tightfisted is performed the following facts will be false: vase object_0 object_1

[STATEMENT]
As initial conditions I have that, cats object_0, cats object_1, collect object_6 object_2, collect object_7 object_2, collect object_8 object_3, collect object_9 object_3, hand object_10, next object_0 object_8, next object_1 object_6, next object_10 object_9, next object_4 object_6, next object_5 object_9, sneeze object_4, sneeze object_5, spring object_6, spring object_8, stupendous object_2, stupendous object_3, texture object_6, texture object_7, texture object_8 and texture object_9.
My goal is to have that next object_10 object_6.

My plan is as follows:

NATURAL-PLAN sas_plan_1
------------------------------
This sequence of instructions outlines the steps required to achieve the goal state, based on the provided PDDL plan.

**Instructions:**

1. **Clip (object_10, object_5, object_9):** Apply the Clip procedure using object 10 and the 'sneeze' attribute of object 5, relating them to the texture of object 9. This establishes a 'vase' relationship between object 10 and object 5, and removes object 10's 'next' association with object 9.
2. **Wretched (object_5, object_9, object_8, object_3):** Execute the Wretched maneuver on object 5. Move its 'next' association from object 9 to object 8, utilizing the connectivity defined by the 'stupendous' object 3.
3. **Tightfisted (object_10, object_5, object_8):** Perform the Tightfisted action using object 10 and object 5 (which has the 'vase' relationship). Link object 10 to object 8 (which has 'texture'). This removes the 'vase' relationship between object 10 and object 5 and sets object 10 to be 'next' to object 8.
4. **Sip (object_10, object_0, object_8):** Initiate the Sip procedure using object 10 and the 'cats' object 0, referencing the texture of object 8. This creates a 'vase' relationship between object 10 and object 0, and removes object 10's 'next' association with object 8.
5. **Memory (object_0, object_8, object_6):** Utilize the Memory operation on the 'cats' object 0, leveraging the 'spring' attributes of object 8 and object 6. This sets object 0 to be 'next' to object 6.
6. **Paltry (object_10, object_0, object_6):** Execute the Paltry action using object 10 (hand) and object 0 (cats), referencing object 6 (texture). This relies on the established 'vase' link between object 10 and object 0, and object 0 now being 'next' to object 6. The action sets object 10 to be 'next' to object 6, and removes the 'vase' link between object 10 and object 0.

*(Goal achieved: object_10 is now 'next' to object_6.)*

PROBLEM
------------------------------
I am playing with a set of objects. Here are the actions I can do

Paltry object_0 object_1 object_2.
Sip object_0 object_1 object_2.
Clip object_0 object_1 object_2.
Wretched object_0 object_1 object_2 object_3.
Memory object_0 object_1 object_2.
Tightfisted object_0 object_1 object_2.

I have the following restrictions on my actions:
To perform paltry action, the following facts need to be true: hand object_0, cats object_1, texture object_2, vase object_0 object_1, and next object_1 object_2
Once paltry is performed the following facts will be true: next object_0 object_2
Once paltry is performed the following facts will be false: vase object_0 object_1
To perform sip action, the following facts need to be true: hand object_0, cats object_1, texture object_2, next object_0 object_2, and next object_1 object_2
Once sip is performed the following facts will be true: vase object_0 object_1
Once sip is performed the following facts will be false: next object_0 object_2
To perform clip action, the following facts need to be true: hand object_0, sneeze object_1, texture object_2, next object_1 object_2, and next object_0 object_2
Once clip is performed the following facts will be true: vase object_0 object_1

NATURAL-PLAN sas_plan_3
------------------------------
This sequence of instructions translates the PDDL plan into human-readable actions, achieving the desired goal state (where `next object_10 object_5` and `next object_9 object_7`). Each action incurs a unit cost of 1.

| Step | Time | Action Translation |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 1 | Unit Cost 1 | Execute the **Clip** action on `object_9`, `object_4`, and `object_8`. This establishes a temporary linkage (`vase`) between `object_9` and `object_4`, while disconnecting `object_9` from `object_8`. |
| 2 | Unit Cost 2 | Execute the **Wretched** action, focusing on `object_4`, `object_8`, `object_7`, and `object_2`. This modifies the successor of `object_4` from `object_8` to `object_7`, facilitated by their shared association with the stupendous item `object_2`. |
| 3 | Unit Cost 3 | Execute the **Tightfisted** action on `object_9`, `object_4`, and `object_7`. This utilizes the temporary linkage established in Step 1 and the new successor relationship established in Step 2 to finalize the required linkage: `object_9` is now connected to `object_7`. The temporary `vase` linkage is removed. |

PROBLEM
------------------------------
I am playing with a set of objects. Here are the actions I can do

Paltry object_0 object_1 object_2.
Sip object_0 object_1 object_2.
Clip object_0 object_1 object_2.
Wretched object_0 object_1 object_2 object_3.
Memory object_0 object_1 object_2.
Tightfisted object_0 object_1 object_2.

I have the following restrictions on my actions:
To perform paltry action, the following facts need to be true: hand object_0, cats object_1, texture object_2, vase object_0 object_1, and next object_1 object_2
Once paltry is performed the following facts will be true: next object_0 object_2
Once paltry is performed the following facts will be false: vase object_0 object_1
To perform sip action, the following facts need to be true: hand object_0, cats object_1, texture object_2, next object_0 object_2, and next object_1 object_2
Once sip is performed the following facts will be true: vase object_0 object_1
Once sip is performed the following facts will be false: next object_0 object_2
To perform clip action, the following facts need to be true: hand object_0, sneeze object_1, texture object_2, next object_1 object_2, and next object_0 object_2
Once clip is performed the following facts will be true: vase object_0 object_1
Once clip is performed the following facts will be false: next object_0 object_2
To perform wretched action, the following facts need to be true: sneeze object_0, texture object_1, texture object_2, stupendous object_3, next object_0 object_1, collect object_1 object_3, and collect object_2 object_3
Once wretched is performed the following facts will be true: next object_0 object_2
Once wretched is performed the following facts will be false: next object_0 object_1
To perform memory action, the following facts need to be true: cats object_0, spring object_1, spring object_2, and next object_0 object_1
Once memory is performed the following facts will be true: next object_0 object_2
Once memory is performed the following facts will be false: next object_0 object_1
To perform tightfisted action, the following facts need to be true: hand object_0, sneeze object_1, texture object_2, next object_1 object_2, and vase object_0 object_1
Once tightfisted is performed the following facts will be true: next object_0 object_2
Once tightfisted is performed the following facts will be false: vase object_0 object_1

[STATEMENT]
As initial conditions I have that, cats object_0, collect object_5 object_1, collect object_6 object_1, collect object_7 object_2, collect object_8 object_2, hand object_10, hand object_9, next object_0 object_5, next object_10 object_5, next object_3 object_5, next object_4 object_8, next object_9 object_5, sneeze object_3, sneeze object_4, spring object_5, spring object_7, stupendous object_1, stupendous object_2, texture object_5, texture object_6, texture object_7 and texture object_8.
My goal is to have that next object_10 object_6 and next object_9 object_6.

NATURAL-PLAN sas_plan_1
------------------------------
This plan details the sequence of actions required to achieve the joint goal `(next object_10 object_6)` and `(next object_9 object_6)`.

| Step | Action Name | Arguments | Human-Readable Instruction |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 1 | **Clip** | `object_9`, `object_3`, `object_5` | Perform the **Clip** operation involving `object_9`, `object_3`, and `object_5`. This creates a `vase` link between `object_9` and `object_3`, removing the 'next' link from `object_9` to `object_5`. |
| 2 | **Clip** | `object_10`, `object_3`, `object_5` | Perform the **Clip** operation involving `object_10`, `object_3`, and `object_5`. This creates a `vase` link between `object_10` and `object_3`, removing the 'next' link from `object_10` to `object_5`. |
| 3 | **Wretched** | `object_3`, `object_5`, `object_6`, `object_1` | Execute the **Wretched** process using `object_3`, `object_5`, `object_6`, and `object_1`. This shifts the 'next' association of `object_3` from `object_5` to `object_6`. |
| 4 | **Tightfisted** | `object_9`, `object_3`, `object_6` | Execute the **Tightfisted** procedure involving `object_9`, `object_3`, and `object_6`. This establishes the desired 'next' link between `object_9` and `object_6`, dissolving the `vase` link between `object_9` and `object_3`. |
| 5 | **Tightfisted** | `object_10`, `object_3`, `object_6` | Execute the **Tightfisted** procedure involving `object_10`, `object_3`, and `object_6`. This establishes the desired 'next' link between `object_10` and `object_6`, dissolving the `vase` link between `object_10` and `object_3`. |
