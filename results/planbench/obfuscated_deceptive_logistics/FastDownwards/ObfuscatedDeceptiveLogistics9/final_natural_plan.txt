This is the sequence of actions required to transition the environment to the goal state:

### Logistics Plan

1. **Wretched Procedure:** Apply the 'Wretched' action involving object 5, moving its linkage from object 8 to object 9. (Requires: object 5 is sneezing, objects 8 and 9 are textures collected by stupendous object 3.)

2. **Clip Operation:** Perform the 'Clip' action using handheld object 11 and sneezing object 5, focusing on texture object 9. This establishes the relationship `(vase object_11 object_5)` and removes `(next object_11 object_9)`.

3. **Wretched Procedure:** Apply the 'Wretched' action involving object 5 again, reversing its linkage from object 9 back to object 8. (Requires: object 5 is sneezing, objects 9 and 8 are textures collected by stupendous object 3.)

4. **Tightfisted Action:** Perform the 'Tightfisted' action using handheld object 11 and sneezing object 5 relative to texture object 8. This establishes the goal linkage: `(next object_11 object_8)`.

5. **Clip Operation:** Perform the 'Clip' action using handheld object 10 and sneezing object 4, focusing on texture object 6. This establishes the relationship `(vase object_10 object_4)` and removes `(next object_10 object_6)`.

6. **Wretched Procedure:** Apply the 'Wretched' action involving object 4, moving its linkage from object 6 to object 7. (Requires: object 4 is sneezing, objects 6 and 7 are textures collected by stupendous object 2.)

7. **Tightfisted Action:** Perform the 'Tightfisted' action using handheld object 10 and sneezing object 4 relative to texture object 7. This establishes the final goal linkage: `(next object_10 object_7)`.
