FINAL-PLAN
------------------------------
I’m missing the source inputs needed to compile the final PDDL. Please provide the following so I can generate FastDownward-compatible depots0 and depots0-scenario-b exactly as requested:

1) operators (six actions)
- The full schemas for exactly six actions, each with:
  - Action name
  - Parameters (including variable names and, if applicable, types)
  - Preconditions (positive and any negative preconditions)
  - Effects (add and delete lists; no penalty/shortfall constructs)
- I will encode these verbatim; no additions or omissions.

2) scenarios
- scenarios.objects: the complete, exact list of objects to declare. I will not add or remove any.
  - Please confirm that object_8 and object_6 are included, since the goal must be (next object_8 object_6).
  - If you want typing, include the types and each object’s type; otherwise I will produce an untyped domain.
- ScenarioB initial facts: the full set of true predicates at time zero for ScenarioB.
  - Include all required base facts to make the six actions applicable.
  - If there are phase/sequence constraints implicit in the scenario, list them or the predicates that encode them so I can enforce ordering explicitly.

3) audit_report
- Any hard constraints or ordering/phase requirements that must be enforced directly (not as penalties).
- Any prohibitions or mandatory conditions that must hold throughout or at termination.
- If specific “timeline” or “contiguity” requirements exist, provide their structure (e.g., phase/day objects and successor links).

4) Predicate arities (confirmation)
- You asked to include these predicates in the domain:
  - hand, cats, sneeze, spring, texture, stupendous
  - vase (?x ?y), next (?x ?y), collect (?x ?y)
- I will assume arity 1 for hand, cats, sneeze, spring, texture, stupendous unless you specify otherwise. Please confirm if any differ.

Notes on the compiled output
- Domain name: depots0
- Problem name: depots0-scenario-b
- Requirements will be limited to :strips, :typing (only if types are provided), and :negative-preconditions. I will not include features not supported by FastDownward.
- No placeholder tokens; fully expanded predicates, objects, actions.
- No costs unless you explicitly require them; if costs are needed, I’ll use (increase (total-cost) …) with :action-costs in both files.
- I will set the problem goal to (next object_8 object_6).
- Any enumerated phases/timelines in audit_report or scenarios will be modeled with explicit objects and successor links, with contiguity enforced to prevent reordering.

Paste the operators, scenarios (with ScenarioB objects and initial facts), and audit_report, and I’ll return the final <domain>…</domain> and <problem>…</problem> artifacts.

NATURAL-PLAN sas_plan_1
------------------------------
Human-readable action sequence (unit-duration steps)

1) t=0→1 — sip object_8 object_1 object_7
- Effect: Creates vase(object_8, object_1) and removes next(object_8, object_7).

2) t=1→2 — memory object_1 object_7 object_6
- Effect: Repoints object_1’s link from next(object_1, object_7) to next(object_1, object_6).

3) t=2→3 — paltry object_8 object_1 object_6
- Effect: Adds next(object_8, object_6) and removes vase(object_8, object_1).

Result: Goal achieved — next(object_8, object_6).
