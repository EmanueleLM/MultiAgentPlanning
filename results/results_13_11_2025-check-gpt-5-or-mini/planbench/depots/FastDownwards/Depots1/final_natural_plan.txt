Here is the human-readable execution of the plan (assuming 1 time unit per action):

1) t=0–1: Perform sip with x=object_8, y=object_1, z=object_7.
   - Preconditions met: hand(object_8), cats(object_1), texture(object_7), next(object_8, object_7), next(object_1, object_7).
   - Effects: add vase(object_8, object_1); delete next(object_8, object_7).

2) t=1–2: Perform memory with x=object_1, y=object_7, z=object_6.
   - Preconditions met: cats(object_1), spring(object_7), spring(object_6), next(object_1, object_7).
   - Effects: add next(object_1, object_6); delete next(object_1, object_7).

3) t=2–3: Perform paltry with x=object_8, y=object_1, z=object_6.
   - Preconditions met: hand(object_8), cats(object_1), texture(object_6), vase(object_8, object_1), next(object_1, object_6).
   - Effects: add next(object_8, object_6); delete vase(object_8, object_1).

Goal achieved: next(object_8, object_6) holds after step 3.
