- Effect: add vase(object_10, object_4); delete next(object_10, object_8)

3) t=2 → 3
- Action: wretched(object_4, object_8, object_7, object_2)
- Effect: next(object_4, object_8) → next(object_4, object_7) [replaces next on object_4]

4) t=3 → 4
- Action: tightfisted(object_10, object_4, object_7)
- Effect: add next(object_10, object_7); delete vase(object_10, object_4)

5) t=4 → 5
- Action: wretched(object_3, object_5, object_6, object_1)
