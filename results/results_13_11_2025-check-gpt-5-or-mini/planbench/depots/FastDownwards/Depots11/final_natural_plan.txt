Here is the human-readable sequence of actions that follows the given plan exactly. Each step is unit-duration, with timestamps shown as [start→end).

1. [t=0→1) WRETCHED(object_4, object_7, object_8, object_2)
   - Effects: add next(object_4, object_8); delete next(object_4, object_7)

2. [t=1→2) CLIP(object_9, object_4, object_8)
   - Effects: add vase(object_9, object_4); delete next(object_9, object_8)

3. [t=2→3) SIP(object_11, object_0, object_5)
   - Effects: add vase(object_11, object_0); delete next(object_11, object_5)

4. [t=3→4) SIP(object_10, object_0, object_5)

5. [t=4→5) WRETCHED(object_4, object_8, object_7, object_2)
   - Effects: add next(object_4, object_7); delete next(object_4, object_8)

6. [t=5→6) TIGHTFISTED(object_9, object_4, object_7)
   - Effects: add next(object_9, object_7); delete vase(object_9, object_4)

7. [t=6→7) WRETCHED(object_3, object_6, object_5, object_1)
   - Effects: add next(object_3, object_5); delete next(object_3, object_6)

8. [t=7→8) MEMORY(object_0, object_5, object_7)
   - Effects: add next(object_0, object_7); delete next(object_0, object_5)

9. [t=8→9) SIP(object_9, object_0, object_7)
   - Effects: add vase(object_9, object_0); delete next(object_9, object_7)

10. [t=9→10) PALTRY(object_11, object_0, object_7)
    - Effects: add next(object_11, object_7); delete vase(object_11, object_0)

11. [t=10→11) PALTRY(object_10, object_0, object_7)
    - Effects: add next(object_10, object_7); delete vase(object_10, object_0)

12. [t=11→12) CLIP(object_10, object_4, object_7)
    - Effects: add vase(object_10, object_4); delete next(object_10, object_7)

13. [t=12→13) WRETCHED(object_4, object_7, object_8, object_2)

15. [t=14→15) MEMORY(object_0, object_7, object_5)
    - Effects: add next(object_0, object_5); delete next(object_0, object_7)

16. [t=15→16) PALTRY(object_9, object_0, object_5)
    - Effects: add next(object_9, object_5); delete vase(object_9, object_0)

17. [t=16→17) CLIP(object_9, object_3, object_5)
    - Effects: add vase(object_9, object_3); delete next(object_9, object_5)
