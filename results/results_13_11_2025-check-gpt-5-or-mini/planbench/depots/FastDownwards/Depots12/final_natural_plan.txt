Here is the human-readable sequence of actions that follows the given plan exactly. Each action is one time unit long; timestamps assume sequential execution.

1. t=0, duration=1 — wretched(object_5, object_8, object_9, object_3): Move sneezer object_5’s link from object_8 to textured object_9 using stupendous object_3.
2. t=1, duration=1 — clip(object_10, object_5, object_9): At textured object_9, bind hand object_10 to sneeze object_5 (create vase(object_10, object_5)) and drop next(object_10, object_9).
3. t=2, duration=1 — wretched(object_4, object_7, object_6, object_2): Move sneezer object_4’s link from object_7 to textured object_6 using stupendous object_2.
4. t=3, duration=1 — sip(object_12, object_0, object_6): At textured object_6, bind hand object_12 to cats object_0 (create vase(object_12, object_0)) and drop next(object_12, object_6).
5. t=4, duration=1 — sip(object_11, object_0, object_6): At textured object_6, bind hand object_11 to cats object_0 (create vase(object_11, object_0)) and drop next(object_11, object_6).
6. t=5, duration=1 — wretched(object_5, object_9, object_8, object_3): Move sneezer object_5’s link from object_9 to textured object_8 using stupendous object_3.
7. t=6, duration=1 — tightfisted(object_10, object_5, object_8): Using sneeze object_5 at textured object_8, move hand object_10 next to object_8 and remove vase(object_10, object_5).
8. t=7, duration=1 — sip(object_10, object_1, object_8): At textured object_8, bind hand object_10 to cats object_1 (create vase(object_10, object_1)) and drop next(object_10, object_8).
9. t=8, duration=1 — memory(object_1, object_8, object_6): Move cats object_1’s link from spring object_8 to spring object_6.
10. t=9, duration=1 — paltry(object_10, object_1, object_6): Using vase(object_10, object_1) and next(object_1, object_6), place hand object_10 next to textured object_6 and remove vase(object_10, object_1).
11. t=10, duration=1 — clip(object_10, object_4, object_6): At textured object_6, bind hand object_10 to sneeze object_4 (create vase(object_10, object_4)) and drop next(object_10, object_6).
12. t=11, duration=1 — wretched(object_4, object_6, object_7, object_2): Move sneezer object_4’s link from object_6 back to textured object_7 using stupendous object_2.
13. t=12, duration=1 — tightfisted(object_10, object_4, object_7): Using sneeze object_4 at textured object_7, move hand object_10 next to object_7 and remove vase(object_10, object_4).
14. t=13, duration=1 — memory(object_0, object_6, object_8): Move cats object_0’s link from spring object_6 to spring object_8.
15. t=14, duration=1 — paltry(object_12, object_0, object_8): Using vase(object_12, object_0) and next(object_0, object_8), place hand object_12 next to textured object_8 and remove vase(object_12, object_0).
16. t=15, duration=1 — paltry(object_11, object_0, object_8): Using vase(object_11, object_0) and next(object_0, object_8), place hand object_11 next to textured object_8 and remove vase(object_11, object_0).
17. t=16, duration=1 — clip(object_11, object_5, object_8): At textured object_8, bind hand object_11 to sneeze object_5 (create vase(object_11, object_5)) and drop next(object_11, object_8).
18. t=17, duration=1 — wretched(object_5, object_8, object_9, object_3): Move sneezer object_5’s link from object_8 back to textured object_9 using stupendous object_3.
19. t=18, duration=1 — tightfisted(object_11, object_5, object_9): Using sneeze object_5 at textured object_9, move hand object_11 next to object_9 and remove vase(object_11, object_5).

Result: Achieved goals — next(object_10, object_7), next(object_11, object_9), and next(object_12, object_8).
