Here is a clear, human-readable rendition of the plan. Each step lists when it happens, its duration (assumed 1 time unit), the exact action with parameters, and a brief description of its effect.

1. [t=0–1] clip(object_11, object_5, object_9)
   - Pair object_11 (hand) with object_5 (sneeze) at texture object_9: create vase(object_11, object_5) and remove next(object_11, object_9).

2. [t=1–2] wretched(object_5, object_9, object_8, object_3)
   - Shift sneezer object_5’s link from object_9 to object_8 (both textured, collected by object_3): add next(object_5, object_8) and remove next(object_5, object_9).

3. [t=2–3] tightfisted(object_11, object_5, object_8)
   - Use the vase(object_11, object_5) and next(object_5, object_8) to move object_11’s link to object_8: add next(object_11, object_8) and remove vase(object_11, object_5).

4. [t=3–4] clip(object_12, object_4, object_6)
   - Pair object_12 (hand) with object_4 (sneeze) at texture object_6: create vase(object_12, object_4) and remove next(object_12, object_6).

5. [t=4–5] sip(object_11, object_0, object_8)
   - With both near texture object_8, pair object_11 (hand) and object_0 (cats): create vase(object_11, object_0) and remove next(object_11, object_8).

6. [t=5–6] sip(object_10, object_0, object_8)
   - Similarly pair object_10 (hand) and object_0 (cats) at texture object_8: create vase(object_10, object_0) and remove next(object_10, object_8).

7. [t=6–7] memory(object_0, object_8, object_6)
   - Move cat object_0’s link from spring object_8 to spring object_6: add next(object_0, object_6) and remove next(object_0, object_8).

8. [t=7–8] paltry(object_11, object_0, object_6)
   - Using vase(object_11, object_0) and next(object_0, object_6), set object_11’s link to object_6: add next(object_11, object_6) and remove vase(object_11, object_0).

9. [t=8–9] clip(object_11, object_4, object_6)
   - Pair object_11 (hand) with object_4 (sneeze) at texture object_6: create vase(object_11, object_4) and remove next(object_11, object_6).

10. [t=9–10] paltry(object_10, object_0, object_6)
    - Using vase(object_10, object_0) and next(object_0, object_6), set object_10’s link to object_6: add next(object_10, object_6) and remove vase(object_10, object_0).

11. [t=10–11] clip(object_10, object_4, object_6)
    - Pair object_10 (hand) with object_4 (sneeze) at texture object_6: create vase(object_10, object_4) and remove next(object_10, object_6).

12. [t=11–12] wretched(object_4, object_6, object_7, object_2)
    - Shift sneezer object_4’s link from texture object_6 to texture object_7 (both collected by object_2): add next(object_4, object_7) and remove next(object_4, object_6).

13. [t=12–13] tightfisted(object_12, object_4, object_7)
    - Using vase(object_12, object_4) and next(object_4, object_7), set object_12’s link to object_7: add next(object_12, object_7) and remove vase(object_12, object_4).

14. [t=13–14] tightfisted(object_11, object_4, object_7)
    - Using vase(object_11, object_4) and next(object_4, object_7), set object_11’s link to object_7: add next(object_11, object_7) and remove vase(object_11, object_4).

15. [t=14–15] tightfisted(object_10, object_4, object_7)
    - Using vase(object_10, object_4) and next(object_4, object_7), set object_10’s link to object_7: add next(object_10, object_7) and remove vase(object_10, object_4).

Result: All goals achieved — next(object_10, object_7), next(object_11, object_7), and next(object_12, object_7). Total steps: 15, total time: 15 units.
