Human-readable action sequence (Statement 1). All actions are sequential with unit duration.

1. t=0, duration=1: clip(object_11, object_5, object_9)
2. t=1, duration=1: wretched(object_5, object_9, object_8, object_3)
3. t=2, duration=1: tightfisted(object_11, object_5, object_8)
4. t=3, duration=1: clip(object_12, object_4, object_6)
5. t=4, duration=1: sip(object_11, object_0, object_8)
6. t=5, duration=1: sip(object_10, object_0, object_8)
7. t=6, duration=1: memory(object_0, object_8, object_6)
8. t=7, duration=1: paltry(object_11, object_0, object_6)
9. t=8, duration=1: clip(object_11, object_4, object_6)
10. t=9, duration=1: paltry(object_10, object_0, object_6)
11. t=10, duration=1: clip(object_10, object_4, object_6)
12. t=11, duration=1: wretched(object_4, object_6, object_7, object_2)
13. t=12, duration=1: tightfisted(object_12, object_4, object_7)
14. t=13, duration=1: tightfisted(object_11, object_4, object_7)
15. t=14, duration=1: tightfisted(object_10, object_4, object_7)

Final goal achieved: next(object_10, object_7), next(object_11, object_7), next(object_12, object_7).
