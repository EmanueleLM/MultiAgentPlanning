Here is a clear, human-readable sequence that follows the given plan exactly. Each step is sequential with duration 1 and timestamps t=start→end.

1) t=0→1: clip object_9 object_4 object_8 — add vase(object_9, object_4); delete next(object_9, object_8)
2) t=1→2: clip object_11 object_4 object_8 — add vase(object_11, object_4); delete next(object_11, object_8)
3) t=2→3: sip object_12 object_0 object_5 — add vase(object_12, object_0); delete next(object_12, object_5)
4) t=3→4: wretched object_4 object_8 object_7 object_2 — add next(object_4, object_7); delete next(object_4, object_8)
5) t=4→5: tightfisted object_9 object_4 object_7 — add next(object_9, object_7); delete vase(object_9, object_4)
6) t=5→6: tightfisted object_11 object_4 object_7 — add next(object_11, object_7); delete vase(object_11, object_4)
7) t=6→7: clip object_10 object_4 object_7 — add vase(object_10, object_4); delete next(object_10, object_7)
8) t=7→8: wretched object_3 object_6 object_5 object_1 — add next(object_3, object_5); delete next(object_3, object_6)
9) t=8→9: memory object_0 object_5 object_7 — add next(object_0, object_7); delete next(object_0, object_5)
10) t=9→10: sip object_9 object_0 object_7 — add vase(object_9, object_0); delete next(object_9, object_7)
11) t=10→11: paltry object_12 object_0 object_7 — add next(object_12, object_7); delete vase(object_12, object_0)
12) t=11→12: clip object_12 object_4 object_7 — add vase(object_12, object_4); delete next(object_12, object_7)
13) t=12→13: wretched object_4 object_7 object_8 object_2 — add next(object_4, object_8); delete next(object_4, object_7)
14) t=13→14: tightfisted object_12 object_4 object_8 — add next(object_12, object_8); delete vase(object_12, object_4)
15) t=14→15: tightfisted object_10 object_4 object_8 — add next(object_10, object_8); delete vase(object_10, object_4)
16) t=15→16: sip object_11 object_0 object_7 — add vase(object_11, object_0); delete next(object_11, object_7)
17) t=16→17: memory object_0 object_7 object_5 — add next(object_0, object_5); delete next(object_0, object_7)
18) t=17→18: paltry object_9 object_0 object_5 — add next(object_9, object_5); delete vase(object_9, object_0)
19) t=18→19: paltry object_11 object_0 object_5 — add next(object_11, object_5); delete vase(object_11, object_0)
20) t=19→20: clip object_11 object_3 object_5 — add vase(object_11, object_3); delete next(object_11, object_5)
21) t=20→21: wretched object_3 object_5 object_6 object_1 — add next(object_3, object_6); delete next(object_3, object_5)
22) t=21→22: tightfisted object_11 object_3 object_6 — add next(object_11, object_6); delete vase(object_11, object_3)

Result: achieves the goal facts — next(object_10, object_8), next(object_11, object_6), next(object_12, object_8), next(object_9, object_5).
