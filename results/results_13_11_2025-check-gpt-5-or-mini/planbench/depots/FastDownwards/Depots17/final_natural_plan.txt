Here is a clear, human-readable rendering of the given plan. Each action is listed in order, with a 1-unit duration and start→end timestamps. Effects are summarized to show what each step accomplishes.

- t=0→1 [duration 1]: clip object_11 object_5 object_9
  - Effect: add vase(object_11, object_5); remove next(object_11, object_9)

- t=1→2 [duration 1]: wretched object_5 object_9 object_8 object_3
  - Effect: add next(object_5, object_8); remove next(object_5, object_9)

- t=2→3 [duration 1]: tightfisted object_11 object_5 object_8
  - Effect: add next(object_11, object_8); remove vase(object_11, object_5)

- t=3→4 [duration 1]: clip object_10 object_4 object_7
  - Effect: add vase(object_10, object_4); remove next(object_10, object_7)

- t=4→5 [duration 1]: sip object_12 object_1 object_8
  - Effect: add vase(object_12, object_1); remove next(object_12, object_8)

- t=5→6 [duration 1]: memory object_1 object_8 object_6
  - Effect: add next(object_1, object_6); remove next(object_1, object_8)

- t=6→7 [duration 1]: wretched object_4 object_7 object_6 object_2
  - Effect: add next(object_4, object_6); remove next(object_4, object_7)

- t=7→8 [duration 1]: tightfisted object_10 object_4 object_6
  - Effect: add next(object_10, object_6); remove vase(object_10, object_4)

- t=8→9 [duration 1]: paltry object_12 object_1 object_6
  - Effect: add next(object_12, object_6); remove vase(object_12, object_1)

- t=9→10 [duration 1]: clip object_12 object_4 object_6
  - Effect: add vase(object_12, object_4); remove next(object_12, object_6)

- t=10→11 [duration 1]: wretched object_4 object_6 object_7 object_2
  - Effect: add next(object_4, object_7); remove next(object_4, object_6)

- t=11→12 [duration 1]: tightfisted object_12 object_4 object_7
  - Effect: add next(object_12, object_7); remove vase(object_12, object_4)

Total duration: 12 time units.

Final goals achieved:
- next(object_10, object_6)
- next(object_11, object_8)
- next(object_12, object_7)
- next(object_13, object_9)
