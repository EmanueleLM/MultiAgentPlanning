Human-readable execution plan (Scenario S2), matching the provided plan exactly. Assume each action takes 1 time unit.

1. t=0–1: wretched(object_3, object_7, object_6, object_1)
   - Redirect next from next(object_3, object_7) to next(object_3, object_6).

2. t=1–2: clip(object_11, object_3, object_6)
   - Create vase(object_11, object_3); remove next(object_11, object_6).

3. t=2–3: wretched(object_3, object_6, object_5, object_1)
   - Redirect next from next(object_3, object_6) to next(object_3, object_5).

4. t=3–4: tightfisted(object_11, object_3, object_5)
   - Create next(object_11, object_5); remove vase(object_11, object_3).

5. t=4–5: memory(object_0, object_8, object_5)
   - Redirect next from next(object_0, object_8) to next(object_0, object_5).

6. t=5–6: sip(object_11, object_0, object_5)
   - Create vase(object_11, object_0); remove next(object_11, object_5).

7. t=6–7: memory(object_0, object_5, object_8)
   - Redirect next from next(object_0, object_5) to next(object_0, object_8).

8. t=7–8: paltry(object_11, object_0, object_8)
   - Create next(object_11, object_8); remove vase(object_11, object_0).

9. t=8–9: clip(object_11, object_4, object_8)
   - Create vase(object_11, object_4); remove next(object_11, object_8).

10. t=9–10: wretched(object_4, object_8, object_10, object_2)
    - Redirect next from next(object_4, object_8) to next(object_4, object_10).

11. t=10–11: tightfisted(object_11, object_4, object_10)
    - Create next(object_11, object_10); remove vase(object_11, object_4).

Goal reached: next(object_11, object_10).
