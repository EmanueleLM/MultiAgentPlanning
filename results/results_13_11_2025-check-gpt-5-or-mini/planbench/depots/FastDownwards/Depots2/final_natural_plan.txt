Here is the human-readable sequence of actions following the provided plan exactly. Assume each action takes 1 time unit.

1) t=0–1 | Action: sip object_8 object_0 object_6
- Description: Use object_8 (in hand) with object_0 at textured location object_6, linking them.
- Key effects: add vase(object_8, object_0); delete next(object_8, object_6).

2) t=1–2 | Action: sip object_7 object_0 object_6
- Description: Use object_7 (in hand) with object_0 at textured location object_6, linking them.
- Key effects: add vase(object_7, object_0); delete next(object_7, object_6).

3) t=2–3 | Action: memory object_0 object_6 object_5
- Description: Shift object_0’s “next” relation from object_6 to object_5.
- Key effects: add next(object_0, object_5); delete next(object_0, object_6).

4) t=3–4 | Action: paltry object_8 object_0 object_5
- Description: Move linkage from vase to “next” for object_8 using object_0 at textured object_5.
- Key effects: add next(object_8, object_5); delete vase(object_8, object_0).

5) t=4–5 | Action: paltry object_7 object_0 object_5
- Description: Move linkage from vase to “next” for object_7 using object_0 at textured object_5.
- Key effects: add next(object_7, object_5); delete vase(object_7, object_0).

Goal achieved: next(object_7, object_5) and next(object_8, object_5).
