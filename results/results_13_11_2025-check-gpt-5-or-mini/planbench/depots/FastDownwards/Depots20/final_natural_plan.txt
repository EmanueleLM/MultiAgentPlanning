Here is the human-readable sequence matching the provided plan. Each action is sequential with unit duration; timestamps denote start→end.

1) Time 0→1: Apply wretched(object_5, object_9, object_10, object_3)
- Preconditions (satisfied): sneeze(object_5); texture(object_9); texture(object_10); stupendous(object_3); next(object_5, object_9); collect(object_9, object_3); collect(object_10, object_3).
- Effect: Establish next(object_5, object_10) and remove next(object_5, object_9).

2) Time 1→2: Apply clip(object_12, object_5, object_10)
- Preconditions (satisfied): hand(object_12); sneeze(object_5); texture(object_10); next(object_5, object_10); next(object_12, object_10).
- Effect: Establish vase(object_12, object_5) and remove next(object_12, object_10).

3) Time 2→3: Apply wretched(object_5, object_10, object_11, object_3)
- Preconditions (satisfied): sneeze(object_5); texture(object_10); texture(object_11); stupendous(object_3); next(object_5, object_10); collect(object_10, object_3); collect(object_11, object_3).
- Effect: Establish next(object_5, object_11) and remove next(object_5, object_10).

4) Time 3→4: Apply tightfisted(object_12, object_5, object_11)
- Preconditions (satisfied): hand(object_12); sneeze(object_5); texture(object_11); next(object_5, object_11); vase(object_12, object_5).
- Effect: Establish next(object_12, object_11) and remove vase(object_12, object_5).

Goal achieved at Time 4: next(object_12, object_11).
