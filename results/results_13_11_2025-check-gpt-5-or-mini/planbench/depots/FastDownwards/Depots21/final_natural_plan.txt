Here is the human-readable execution of the provided plan. Each action lists its start time (t) and duration (assumed 1 time unit), and summarizes the key state changes.

1) t=0, duration=1
   Action: wretched(object_5, object_9, object_10, object_3)
   Effect: next(object_5, object_9) becomes false; next(object_5, object_10) becomes true.

2) t=1, duration=1
   Action: clip(object_12, object_5, object_10)
   Effect: next(object_12, object_10) becomes false; vase(object_12, object_5) becomes true.

3) t=2, duration=1
   Action: wretched(object_5, object_10, object_11, object_3)
   Effect: next(object_5, object_10) becomes false; next(object_5, object_11) becomes true.

4) t=3, duration=1
   Action: tightfisted(object_12, object_5, object_11)
   Effect: vase(object_12, object_5) becomes false; next(object_12, object_11) becomes true.

Goal achieved after step 4: next(object_12, object_11).
