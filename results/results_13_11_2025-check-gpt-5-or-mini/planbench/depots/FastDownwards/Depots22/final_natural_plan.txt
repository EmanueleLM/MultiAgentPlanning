Here is the human-readable sequence of actions that follows the provided plan exactly. Timestamps assume unit duration (1 time unit per action) and execute sequentially.

1) t=0 → t=1 — clip(object_12, object_4, object_10)
- At textured object_10, hand-held object_12 clips sneezing object_4.
- Effect: create vase(object_12, object_4); remove next(object_12, object_10).

2) t=1 → t=2 — wretched(object_4, object_10, object_8, object_2)
- Sneezing object_4 moves from textured object_10 to textured object_8 under stupendous object_2.
- Effect: set next(object_4, object_8); remove next(object_4, object_10).

3) t=2 → t=3 — tightfisted(object_12, object_4, object_8)
- With vase(object_12, object_4) and object_4 at object_8, hand-held object_12 advances to object_8.
- Effect: set next(object_12, object_8); remove vase(object_12, object_4).

4) t=3 → t=4 — wretched(object_3, object_7, object_6, object_1)
- Sneezing object_3 moves from textured object_7 to textured object_6 under stupendous object_1.
- Effect: set next(object_3, object_6); remove next(object_3, object_7).

5) t=4 → t=5 — clip(object_11, object_3, object_6)
- At textured object_6, hand-held object_11 clips sneezing object_3.
- Effect: create vase(object_11, object_3); remove next(object_11, object_6).

6) t=5 → t=6 — wretched(object_3, object_6, object_7, object_1)
- Sneezing object_3 moves back from textured object_6 to textured object_7 under stupendous object_1.
- Effect: set next(object_3, object_7); remove next(object_3, object_6).

7) t=6 → t=7 — tightfisted(object_11, object_3, object_7)
- With vase(object_11, object_3) and object_3 at object_7, hand-held object_11 advances to object_7.
- Effect: set next(object_11, object_7); remove vase(object_11, object_3).

Outcome: Goal achieved — next(object_11, object_7) and next(object_12, object_8).
