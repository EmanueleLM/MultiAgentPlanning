Here is the human-readable execution of the plan, step by step. Each action is listed exactly as in the plan, with a timestamp and unit duration.

- Step 1 (t=0, duration=1): clip object_12 object_5 object_11
  - Creates vase(object_12, object_5) and removes next(object_12, object_11).

- Step 2 (t=1, duration=1): wretched object_5 object_11 object_10 object_3
  - Sets next(object_5, object_10) and removes next(object_5, object_11).

- Step 3 (t=2, duration=1): tightfisted object_12 object_5 object_10
  - Sets next(object_12, object_10) and removes vase(object_12, object_5).

- Step 4 (t=3, duration=1): wretched object_4 object_8 object_6 object_2
  - Sets next(object_4, object_6) and removes next(object_4, object_8).

- Step 5 (t=4, duration=1): wretched object_4 object_6 object_7 object_2
  - Sets next(object_4, object_7) and removes next(object_4, object_6).

- Step 6 (t=5, duration=1): clip object_13 object_4 object_7
  - Creates vase(object_13, object_4) and removes next(object_13, object_7).

- Step 7 (t=6, duration=1): wretched object_4 object_7 object_6 object_2
  - Sets next(object_4, object_6) and removes next(object_4, object_7).

- Step 8 (t=7, duration=1): tightfisted object_13 object_4 object_6
  - Sets next(object_13, object_6) and removes vase(object_13, object_4).

- Step 9 (t=8, duration=1): memory object_0 object_9 object_6
  - Sets next(object_0, object_6) and removes next(object_0, object_9).

- Step 10 (t=9, duration=1): sip object_13 object_0 object_6
  - Creates vase(object_13, object_0) and removes next(object_13, object_6).

- Step 11 (t=10, duration=1): memory object_0 object_6 object_9
  - Sets next(object_0, object_9) and removes next(object_0, object_6).

- Step 12 (t=11, duration=1): paltry object_13 object_0 object_9
  - Sets next(object_13, object_9) and removes vase(object_13, object_0).

Result: After Step 12, the goals are satisfied:
- next(object_12, object_10)
- next(object_13, object_9)
