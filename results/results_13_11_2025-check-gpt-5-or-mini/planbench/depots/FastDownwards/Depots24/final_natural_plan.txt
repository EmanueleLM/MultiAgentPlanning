Here is a clear, human-readable sequence of the actions, matching the provided plan exactly. Each action is listed with a start time and unit duration (1.0).

- Step 1 — t=0.0, dur=1.0: clip(object_12, object_5, object_11)
  - Effect: add vase(object_12, object_5); delete next(object_12, object_11)

- Step 2 — t=1.0, dur=1.0: wretched(object_5, object_11, object_10, object_3)
  - Effect: add next(object_5, object_10); delete next(object_5, object_11)

- Step 3 — t=2.0, dur=1.0: tightfisted(object_12, object_5, object_10)
  - Effect: add next(object_12, object_10); delete vase(object_12, object_5)

- Step 4 — t=3.0, dur=1.0: wretched(object_4, object_8, object_6, object_2)
  - Effect: add next(object_4, object_6); delete next(object_4, object_8)

- Step 5 — t=4.0, dur=1.0: wretched(object_4, object_6, object_7, object_2)
  - Effect: add next(object_4, object_7); delete next(object_4, object_6)

- Step 6 — t=5.0, dur=1.0: clip(object_13, object_4, object_7)
  - Effect: add vase(object_13, object_4); delete next(object_13, object_7)

- Step 7 — t=6.0, dur=1.0: wretched(object_4, object_7, object_6, object_2)
  - Effect: add next(object_4, object_6); delete next(object_4, object_7)

- Step 8 — t=7.0, dur=1.0: tightfisted(object_13, object_4, object_6)
  - Effect: add next(object_13, object_6); delete vase(object_13, object_4)

- Step 9 — t=8.0, dur=1.0: memory(object_0, object_9, object_6)
  - Effect: add next(object_0, object_6); delete next(object_0, object_9)

- Step 10 — t=9.0, dur=1.0: sip(object_13, object_0, object_6)
  - Effect: add vase(object_13, object_0); delete next(object_13, object_6)

- Step 11 — t=10.0, dur=1.0: memory(object_0, object_6, object_9)
  - Effect: add next(object_0, object_9); delete next(object_0, object_6)

- Step 12 — t=11.0, dur=1.0: paltry(object_13, object_0, object_9)
  - Effect: add next(object_13, object_9); delete vase(object_13, object_0)

Final goal achieved:
- next(object_12, object_10) established at Step 3
- next(object_13, object_9) established at Step 12
