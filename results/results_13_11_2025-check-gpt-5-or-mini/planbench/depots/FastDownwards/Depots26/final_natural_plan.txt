Here is the human-readable execution of the provided plan, step by step. Each step lists the action with its parameters, a brief plain-language effect, and a simple timestamp. All steps are unit-duration.

1. t=1, Δt=1 — wretched(object_3, object_6, object_7, object_1)
   - Move the “next” link of object_3 from object_6 to object_7 (using textures on 6 and 7 and stupendous object_1).

2. t=2, Δt=1 — clip(object_13, object_3, object_7)
   - Create vase(object_13, object_3) and remove next(object_13, object_7).

3. t=3, Δt=1 — clip(object_12, object_3, object_7)
   - Create vase(object_12, object_3) and remove next(object_12, object_7).

4. t=4, Δt=1 — wretched(object_3, object_7, object_5, object_1)
   - Move the “next” link of object_3 from object_7 to object_5.

5. t=5, Δt=1 — tightfisted(object_13, object_3, object_5)
   - From vase(object_13, object_3), set next(object_13, object_5) and remove that vase link.

6. t=6, Δt=1 — tightfisted(object_12, object_3, object_5)
   - From vase(object_12, object_3), set next(object_12, object_5) and remove that vase link.

7. t=7, Δt=1 — memory(object_0, object_8, object_5)
   - Move the “next” link of object_0 from object_8 to object_5.

8. t=8, Δt=1 — sip(object_13, object_0, object_5)
   - Create vase(object_13, object_0) and remove next(object_13, object_5).

9. t=9, Δt=1 — sip(object_12, object_0, object_5)
   - Create vase(object_12, object_0) and remove next(object_12, object_5).

10. t=10, Δt=1 — wretched(object_4, object_9, object_10, object_2)
    - Move the “next” link of object_4 from object_9 to object_10.

11. t=11, Δt=1 — clip(object_11, object_4, object_10)
    - Create vase(object_11, object_4) and remove next(object_11, object_10).

12. t=12, Δt=1 — wretched(object_4, object_10, object_8, object_2)
    - Move the “next” link of object_4 from object_10 to object_8.

13. t=13, Δt=1 — tightfisted(object_11, object_4, object_8)
    - From vase(object_11, object_4), set next(object_11, object_8) and remove that vase link.

14. t=14, Δt=1 — memory(object_0, object_5, object_8)
    - Move the “next” link of object_0 from object_5 to object_8.

15. t=15, Δt=1 — paltry(object_13, object_0, object_8)
    - From vase(object_13, object_0) and next(object_0, object_8), set next(object_13, object_8) and remove that vase link.

16. t=16, Δt=1 — clip(object_13, object_4, object_8)
    - Create vase(object_13, object_4) and remove next(object_13, object_8).

17. t=17, Δt=1 — paltry(object_12, object_0, object_8)
    - From vase(object_12, object_0) and next(object_0, object_8), set next(object_12, object_8) and remove that vase link.

18. t=18, Δt=1 — clip(object_12, object_4, object_8)
    - Create vase(object_12, object_4) and remove next(object_12, object_8).

19. t=19, Δt=1 — wretched(object_4, object_8, object_10, object_2)
    - Move the “next” link of object_4 from object_8 to object_10.

20. t=20, Δt=1 — tightfisted(object_13, object_4, object_10)
    - From vase(object_13, object_4), set next(object_13, object_10) and remove that vase link.

21. t=21, Δt=1 — wretched(object_4, object_10, object_9, object_2)
    - Move the “next” link of object_4 from object_10 to object_9.

22. t=22, Δt=1 — tightfisted(object_12, object_4, object_9)
    - From vase(object_12, object_4), set next(object_12, object_9) and remove that vase link.

23. t=23, Δt=1 — sip(object_11, object_0, object_8)
    - Create vase(object_11, object_0) and remove next(object_11, object_8).

24. t=24, Δt=1 — memory(object_0, object_8, object_5)
    - Move the “next” link of object_0 from object_8 to object_5.

25. t=25, Δt=1 — paltry(object_11, object_0, object_5)
