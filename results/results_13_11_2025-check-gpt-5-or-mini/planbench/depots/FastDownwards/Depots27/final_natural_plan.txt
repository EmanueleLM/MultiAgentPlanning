Here is the human-readable action sequence that follows the given plan exactly. Each step lists a timestamp (t) and assumes unit duration (dur=1):

1) [t=0, dur=1] wretched(a=object_5, b=object_10, c=object_11, d=object_3) → set next(object_5, object_11); remove next(object_5, object_10)

2) [t=1, dur=1] clip(x=object_12, y=object_5, z=object_11) → add vase(object_12, object_5); remove next(object_12, object_11)

3) [t=2, dur=1] wretched(a=object_5, b=object_11, c=object_10, d=object_3) → set next(object_5, object_10); remove next(object_5, object_11)

4) [t=3, dur=1] tightfisted(x=object_12, y=object_5, z=object_10) → add next(object_12, object_10); remove vase(object_12, object_5)

5) [t=4, dur=1] wretched(a=object_5, b=object_10, c=object_9, d=object_3) → set next(object_5, object_9); remove next(object_5, object_10)

6) [t=5, dur=1] wretched(a=object_4, b=object_7, c=object_8, d=object_2) → set next(object_4, object_8); remove next(object_4, object_7)

7) [t=6, dur=1] clip(x=object_14, y=object_4, z=object_8) → add vase(object_14, object_4); remove next(object_14, object_8)

8) [t=7, dur=1] wretched(a=object_4, b=object_8, c=object_6, d=object_2) → set next(object_4, object_6); remove next(object_4, object_8)

9) [t=8, dur=1] tightfisted(x=object_14, y=object_4, z=object_6) → add next(object_14, object_6); remove vase(object_14, object_4)

10) [t=9, dur=1] sip(x=object_14, y=object_0, z=object_6) → add vase(object_14, object_0); remove next(object_14, object_6)

11) [t=10, dur=1] sip(x=object_13, y=object_0, z=object_6) → add vase(object_13, object_0); remove next(object_13, object_6)

12) [t=11, dur=1] memory(x=object_0, y=object_6, z=object_9) → set next(object_0, object_9); remove next(object_0, object_6)

13) [t=12, dur=1] paltry(x=object_14, y=object_0, z=object_9) → add next(object_14, object_9); remove vase(object_14, object_0)

14) [t=13, dur=1] paltry(x=object_13, y=object_0, z=object_9) → add next(object_13, object_9); remove vase(object_13, object_0)

15) [t=14, dur=1] clip(x=object_13, y=object_5, z=object_9) → add vase(object_13, object_5); remove next(object_13, object_9)

16) [t=15, dur=1] wretched(a=object_5, b=object_9, c=object_10, d=object_3) → set next(object_5, object_10); remove next(object_5, object_9)

17) [t=16, dur=1] tightfisted(x=object_13, y=object_5, z=object_10) → add next(object_13, object_10); remove vase(object_13, object_5)
