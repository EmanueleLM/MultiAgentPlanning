Here is a clear, step-by-step rendering of the plan. Each action lists its start time (t), a unit duration of 1, the action with its parameters, and its effects (adds and deletes) exactly per the specification.

- Step 1 — t=0, duration=1
  - Action: wretched(object_4, object_9, object_10, object_2)
  - Add: next(object_4, object_10)
  - Delete: next(object_4, object_9)

- Step 2 — t=1, duration=1
  - Action: clip(object_11, object_4, object_10)
  - Add: vase(object_11, object_4)
  - Delete: next(object_11, object_10)

- Step 3 — t=2, duration=1
  - Action: wretched(object_4, object_10, object_8, object_2)
  - Add: next(object_4, object_8)
  - Delete: next(object_4, object_10)

- Step 4 — t=3, duration=1
  - Action: wretched(object_3, object_6, object_5, object_1)
  - Add: next(object_3, object_5)
  - Delete: next(object_3, object_6)

- Step 5 — t=4, duration=1
  - Action: wretched(object_4, object_8, object_9, object_2)
  - Add: next(object_4, object_9)
  - Delete: next(object_4, object_8)

- Step 6 — t=5, duration=1
  - Action: clip(object_14, object_4, object_9)
  - Add: vase(object_14, object_4)
  - Delete: next(object_14, object_9)

- Step 7 — t=6, duration=1
  - Action: tightfisted(object_11, object_4, object_9)
  - Add: next(object_11, object_9)
  - Delete: vase(object_11, object_4)

- Step 8 — t=7, duration=1
  - Action: wretched(object_4, object_9, object_8, object_2)
  - Add: next(object_4, object_8)
  - Delete: next(object_4, object_9)

- Step 9 — t=8, duration=1
  - Action: tightfisted(object_14, object_4, object_8)
  - Add: next(object_14, object_8)
  - Delete: vase(object_14, object_4)

- Step 10 — t=9, duration=1
  - Action: wretched(object_3, object_5, object_7, object_1)
  - Add: next(object_3, object_7)
  - Delete: next(object_3, object_5)

- Step 11 — t=10, duration=1
  - Action: clip(object_13, object_3, object_7)
  - Add: vase(object_13, object_3)
  - Delete: next(object_13, object_7)

- Step 12 — t=11, duration=1
  - Action: sip(object_14, object_0, object_8)
  - Add: vase(object_14, object_0)
  - Delete: next(object_14, object_8)

- Step 13 — t=12, duration=1
  - Action: wretched(object_3, object_7, object_5, object_1)
  - Add: next(object_3, object_5)
  - Delete: next(object_3, object_7)

- Step 14 — t=13, duration=1
  - Action: tightfisted(object_13, object_3, object_5)
  - Add: next(object_13, object_5)
  - Delete: vase(object_13, object_3)

- Step 15 — t=14, duration=1
  - Action: memory(object_0, object_8, object_5)
  - Add: next(object_0, object_5)
  - Delete: next(object_0, object_8)

- Step 16 — t=15, duration=1
  - Action: paltry(object_14, object_0, object_5)
  - Add: next(object_14, object_5)
  - Delete: vase(object_14, object_0)

- Step 17 — t=16, duration=1
  - Action: clip(object_14, object_3, object_5)
  - Add: vase(object_14, object_3)
  - Delete: next(object_14, object_5)

- Step 18 — t=17, duration=1
  - Action: wretched(object_3, object_5, object_7, object_1)
  - Add: next(object_3, object_7)
  - Delete: next(object_3, object_5)

- Step 19 — t=18, duration=1
  - Action: tightfisted(object_14, object_3, object_7)
  - Add: next(object_14, object_7)
  - Delete: vase(object_14, object_3)

- Step 20 — t=19, duration=1
  - Action: sip(object_12, object_0, object_5)
  - Add: vase(object_12, object_0)
  - Delete: next(object_12, object_5)

- Step 21 — t=20, duration=1
  - Action: memory(object_0, object_5, object_8)
  - Add: next(object_0, object_8)
  - Delete: next(object_0, object_5)

- Step 22 — t=21, duration=1
  - Action: paltry(object_12, object_0, object_8)
  - Add: next(object_12, object_8)
  - Delete: vase(object_12, object_0)

Final goal achieved:
- next(object_11, object_9)
- next(object_12, object_8)
- next(object_13, object_5)
- next(object_14, object_7)
