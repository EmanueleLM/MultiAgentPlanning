Below is the human-readable sequence of actions that follows the provided plan exactly. Actions are instantaneous; we annotate each with a timestamp (seconds) and assume unit duration = 1.

1. t=0, dur=1: wretched(a=object_4, b=object_10, c=object_8, d=object_2) — rewires: next(object_4,object_10) → next(object_4,object_8)
2. t=1, dur=1: wretched(a=object_3, b=object_5, c=object_6, d=object_1) — rewires: next(object_3,object_5) → next(object_3,object_6)
3. t=2, dur=1: clip(x=object_13, y=object_3, z=object_6) — removes next(object_13,object_6); adds vase(object_13,object_3)
