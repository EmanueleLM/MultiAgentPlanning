FINAL-PLAN
------------------------------
I’m missing the source inputs needed to compile the final PDDL. Please provide the following so I can generate FastDownward-compatible depots0 and depots0-scenario-b exactly as requested:

1) operators (six actions)
- The full schemas for exactly six actions, each with:
  - Action name
  - Parameters (including variable names and, if applicable, types)
  - Preconditions (positive and any negative preconditions)
  - Effects (add and delete lists; no penalty/shortfall constructs)
- I will encode these verbatim; no additions or omissions.

2) scenarios
- scenarios.objects: the complete, exact list of objects to declare. I will not add or remove any.
  - Please confirm that object_8 and object_6 are included, since the goal must be (next object_8 object_6).
  - If you want typing, include the types and each object’s type; otherwise I will produce an untyped domain.
- ScenarioB initial facts: the full set of true predicates at time zero for ScenarioB.
  - Include all required base facts to make the six actions applicable.
  - If there are phase/sequence constraints implicit in the scenario, list them or the predicates that encode them so I can enforce ordering explicitly.

3) audit_report
- Any hard constraints or ordering/phase requirements that must be enforced directly (not as penalties).
- Any prohibitions or mandatory conditions that must hold throughout or at termination.
- If specific “timeline” or “contiguity” requirements exist, provide their structure (e.g., phase/day objects and successor links).

4) Predicate arities (confirmation)
- You asked to include these predicates in the domain:
  - hand, cats, sneeze, spring, texture, stupendous
  - vase (?x ?y), next (?x ?y), collect (?x ?y)
- I will assume arity 1 for hand, cats, sneeze, spring, texture, stupendous unless you specify otherwise. Please confirm if any differ.

Notes on the compiled output
- Domain name: depots0
- Problem name: depots0-scenario-b
- Requirements will be limited to :strips, :typing (only if types are provided), and :negative-preconditions. I will not include features not supported by FastDownward.
- No placeholder tokens; fully expanded predicates, objects, actions.
- No costs unless you explicitly require them; if costs are needed, I’ll use (increase (total-cost) …) with :action-costs in both files.
- I will set the problem goal to (next object_8 object_6).
- Any enumerated phases/timelines in audit_report or scenarios will be modeled with explicit objects and successor links, with contiguity enforced to prevent reordering.

Paste the operators, scenarios (with ScenarioB objects and initial facts), and audit_report, and I’ll return the final <domain>…</domain> and <problem>…</problem> artifacts.

NATURAL-PLAN sas_plan_1
------------------------------
Human-readable action sequence (unit-duration steps)

1) t=0→1 — sip object_8 object_1 object_7
- Effect: Creates vase(object_8, object_1) and removes next(object_8, object_7).

2) t=1→2 — memory object_1 object_7 object_6
- Effect: Repoints object_1’s link from next(object_1, object_7) to next(object_1, object_6).

3) t=2→3 — paltry object_8 object_1 object_6
- Effect: Adds next(object_8, object_6) and removes vase(object_8, object_1).

Result: Goal achieved — next(object_8, object_6).

NATURAL-PLAN sas_plan_10
------------------------------
Here is the human-readable execution of the plan (assuming 1 time unit per action):

1) t=0–1: Perform sip with x=object_8, y=object_1, z=object_7.
   - Preconditions met: hand(object_8), cats(object_1), texture(object_7), next(object_8, object_7), next(object_1, object_7).
   - Effects: add vase(object_8, object_1); delete next(object_8, object_7).

2) t=1–2: Perform memory with x=object_1, y=object_7, z=object_6.
   - Preconditions met: cats(object_1), spring(object_7), spring(object_6), next(object_1, object_7).
   - Effects: add next(object_1, object_6); delete next(object_1, object_7).

3) t=2–3: Perform paltry with x=object_8, y=object_1, z=object_6.
   - Preconditions met: hand(object_8), cats(object_1), texture(object_6), vase(object_8, object_1), next(object_1, object_6).
   - Effects: add next(object_8, object_6); delete vase(object_8, object_1).

Goal achieved: next(object_8, object_6) holds after step 3.

PROBLEM
------------------------------
I am playing with a set of objects. Here are the actions I can do

Paltry object_0 object_1 object_2.

NATURAL-PLAN sas_plan_1
------------------------------
Here is the human-readable sequence of actions following the provided plan exactly. Assume each action takes 1 time unit.

1) t=0–1 | Action: sip object_8 object_0 object_6
- Description: Use object_8 (in hand) with object_0 at textured location object_6, linking them.
- Key effects: add vase(object_8, object_0); delete next(object_8, object_6).

2) t=1–2 | Action: sip object_7 object_0 object_6
- Description: Use object_7 (in hand) with object_0 at textured location object_6, linking them.
- Key effects: add vase(object_7, object_0); delete next(object_7, object_6).

3) t=2–3 | Action: memory object_0 object_6 object_5
- Description: Shift object_0’s “next” relation from object_6 to object_5.
- Key effects: add next(object_0, object_5); delete next(object_0, object_6).

4) t=3–4 | Action: paltry object_8 object_0 object_5
- Description: Move linkage from vase to “next” for object_8 using object_0 at textured object_5.
- Key effects: add next(object_8, object_5); delete vase(object_8, object_0).

5) t=4–5 | Action: paltry object_7 object_0 object_5
- Description: Move linkage from vase to “next” for object_7 using object_0 at textured object_5.
- Key effects: add next(object_7, object_5); delete vase(object_7, object_0).

Goal achieved: next(object_7, object_5) and next(object_8, object_5).

NATURAL-PLAN sas_plan_1
------------------------------
Here is the human-readable sequence of actions that follows the provided plan exactly and achieves the goal. I report discrete timestamps (t) in unit steps; each action takes Δt = 1 unit.

- Step 1 (t=0 → 1): sip(a=object_8, b=object_0, c=object_6)
  - Preconditions used: hand(object_8), cats(object_0), texture(object_6), next(object_8, object_6), next(object_0, object_6)
  - Effects: add vase(object_8, object_0); delete next(object_8, object_6)

- Step 2 (t=1 → 2): sip(a=object_7, b=object_0, c=object_6)
  - Preconditions used: hand(object_7), cats(object_0), texture(object_6), next(object_7, object_6), next(object_0, object_6)
  - Effects: add vase(object_7, object_0); delete next(object_7, object_6)

- Step 3 (t=2 → 3): memory(a=object_0, b=object_6, c=object_5)
  - Preconditions used: cats(object_0), spring(object_6), spring(object_5), next(object_0, object_6)
  - Effects: add next(object_0, object_5); delete next(object_0, object_6)

- Step 4 (t=3 → 4): paltry(a=object_8, b=object_0, c=object_5)
  - Preconditions used: hand(object_8), cats(object_0), texture(object_5), vase(object_8, object_0), next(object_0, object_5)
  - Effects: add next(object_8, object_5); delete vase(object_8, object_0)

- Step 5 (t=4 → 5): paltry(a=object_7, b=object_0, c=object_5)
  - Preconditions used: hand(object_7), cats(object_0), texture(object_5), vase(object_7, object_0), next(object_0, object_5)
  - Effects: add next(object_7, object_5); delete vase(object_7, object_0)

Result: Goal achieved — next(object_7, object_5) and next(object_8, object_5) are both true. Total steps: 5 (unit cost).
