Here is the human-readable sequence of actions that follows the provided plan exactly and achieves the goal. I report discrete timestamps (t) in unit steps; each action takes Δt = 1 unit.

- Step 1 (t=0 → 1): sip(a=object_8, b=object_0, c=object_6)
  - Preconditions used: hand(object_8), cats(object_0), texture(object_6), next(object_8, object_6), next(object_0, object_6)
  - Effects: add vase(object_8, object_0); delete next(object_8, object_6)

- Step 2 (t=1 → 2): sip(a=object_7, b=object_0, c=object_6)
  - Preconditions used: hand(object_7), cats(object_0), texture(object_6), next(object_7, object_6), next(object_0, object_6)
  - Effects: add vase(object_7, object_0); delete next(object_7, object_6)

- Step 3 (t=2 → 3): memory(a=object_0, b=object_6, c=object_5)
  - Preconditions used: cats(object_0), spring(object_6), spring(object_5), next(object_0, object_6)
  - Effects: add next(object_0, object_5); delete next(object_0, object_6)

- Step 4 (t=3 → 4): paltry(a=object_8, b=object_0, c=object_5)
  - Preconditions used: hand(object_8), cats(object_0), texture(object_5), vase(object_8, object_0), next(object_0, object_5)
  - Effects: add next(object_8, object_5); delete vase(object_8, object_0)

- Step 5 (t=4 → 5): paltry(a=object_7, b=object_0, c=object_5)
  - Preconditions used: hand(object_7), cats(object_0), texture(object_5), vase(object_7, object_0), next(object_0, object_5)
  - Effects: add next(object_7, object_5); delete vase(object_7, object_0)

Result: Goal achieved — next(object_7, object_5) and next(object_8, object_5) are both true. Total steps: 5 (unit cost).
