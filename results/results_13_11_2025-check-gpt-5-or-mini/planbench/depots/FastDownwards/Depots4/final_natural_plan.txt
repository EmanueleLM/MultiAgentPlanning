Here is the human-readable sequence of actions that follows the provided plan exactly and achieves the goal.

- Step 1 [t: s0→s1, duration: 1]: memory(object_1, object_6, object_7)
  - Preconditions (met at s0): cats(object_1), spring(object_6), spring(object_7), next(object_1, object_6), cur(s0), succ(s0, s1)
  - Effect: move the next-link of object_1 from object_6 to object_7
    - Delete: next(object_1, object_6)
    - Add: next(object_1, object_7)
    - Advance time to cur(s1)

- Step 2 [t: s1→s2, duration: 1]: sip(object_9, object_1, object_7)
  - Preconditions (met at s1): hand(object_9), cats(object_1), texture(object_7), next(object_9, object_7), next(object_1, object_7), cur(s1), succ(s1, s2)
  - Effect: create a vase relation between object_9 and object_1, and clear object_9’s next to object_7
    - Add: vase(object_9, object_1)
    - Delete: next(object_9, object_7)
    - Advance time to cur(s2)

- Step 3 [t: s2→s3, duration: 1]: memory(object_1, object_7, object_6)
  - Preconditions (met at s2): cats(object_1), spring(object_7), spring(object_6), next(object_1, object_7), cur(s2), succ(s2, s3)
  - Effect: move the next-link of object_1 from object_7 back to object_6
    - Delete: next(object_1, object_7)
    - Add: next(object_1, object_6)
    - Advance time to cur(s3)

- Step 4 [t: s3→s4, duration: 1]: paltry(object_9, object_1, object_6)
  - Preconditions (met at s3): hand(object_9), cats(object_1), texture(object_6), vase(object_9, object_1), next(object_1, object_6), cur(s3), succ(s3, s4)
  - Effect: set object_9’s next to object_6 and remove the vase relation
    - Add: next(object_9, object_6)
    - Delete: vase(object_9, object_1)
    - Advance time to cur(s4)

Result at s4:
- Goal holds: next(object_8, object_7) remained true throughout; next(object_9, object_6) achieved; cur(s4) true.
