Assumptions: classical STRIPS with unit action cost; we report timestamps as consecutive unit-time steps (duration 1 per action).

- Step 1 [t=0–1, duration 1]: Execute wretched(a=object_3, b=object_5, c=object_6, d=object_1).
  - Preconditions met: sneeze(object_3), texture(object_5), texture(object_6), stupendous(object_1), next(object_3, object_5), collect(object_5, object_1), collect(object_6, object_1).
  - Effects: add next(object_3, object_6); delete next(object_3, object_5).

- Step 2 [t=1–2, duration 1]: Execute clip(a=object_9, b=object_3, c=object_6).
  - Preconditions met: hand(object_9), sneeze(object_3), texture(object_6), next(object_3, object_6), next(object_9, object_6).
  - Effects: add vase(object_9, object_3); delete next(object_9, object_6).

- Step 3 [t=2–3, duration 1]: Execute wretched(a=object_3, b=object_6, c=object_5, d=object_1).
  - Preconditions met: sneeze(object_3), texture(object_6), texture(object_5), stupendous(object_1), next(object_3, object_6), collect(object_6, object_1), collect(object_5, object_1).
  - Effects: add next(object_3, object_5); delete next(object_3, object_6).

- Step 4 [t=3–4, duration 1]: Execute tightfisted(a=object_9, b=object_3, c=object_5).
  - Preconditions met: hand(object_9), sneeze(object_3), texture(object_5), next(object_3, object_5), vase(object_9, object_3).
  - Effects: add next(object_9, object_5); delete vase(object_9, object_3).

- Step 5 [t=4–5, duration 1]: Execute sip(a=object_9, b=object_0, c=object_5).
  - Preconditions met: hand(object_9), cats(object_0), texture(object_5), next(object_9, object_5), next(object_0, object_5).
  - Effects: add vase(object_9, object_0); delete next(object_9, object_5).

- Step 6 [t=5–6, duration 1]: Execute memory(a=object_0, b=object_5, c=object_7).
  - Preconditions met: cats(object_0), spring(object_5), spring(object_7), next(object_0, object_5).
  - Effects: add next(object_0, object_7); delete next(object_0, object_5).

- Step 7 [t=6–7, duration 1]: Execute paltry(a=object_9, b=object_0, c=object_7).
  - Preconditions met: hand(object_9), cats(object_0), texture(object_7), vase(object_9, object_0), next(object_0, object_7).
  - Effects: add next(object_9, object_7); delete vase(object_9, object_0).

Result: Goal achieved — next(object_9, object_7) holds at t=7. Total actions: 7; total duration: 7 time units.
