Here is the human-readable sequence that follows the plan exactly and achieves the goal next(object_9, object_7). Each step takes 1 time unit and starts immediately after the previous one.

1) t=0–1 (dur=1): wretched object_3 object_5 object_6 object_1
- Effect: switch next(object_3, object_5) to next(object_3, object_6).

2) t=1–2 (dur=1): clip object_9 object_3 object_6
- Effect: create vase(object_9, object_3) and remove next(object_9, object_6).

3) t=2–3 (dur=1): wretched object_3 object_6 object_5 object_1
- Effect: switch next(object_3, object_6) back to next(object_3, object_5).

4) t=3–4 (dur=1): tightfisted object_9 object_3 object_5
- Effect: create next(object_9, object_5) and remove vase(object_9, object_3).

5) t=4–5 (dur=1): sip object_9 object_0 object_5
- Effect: create vase(object_9, object_0) and remove next(object_9, object_5).

6) t=5–6 (dur=1): memory object_0 object_5 object_7
- Effect: switch next(object_0, object_5) to next(object_0, object_7).

7) t=6–7 (dur=1): paltry object_9 object_0 object_7
- Effect: create next(object_9, object_7) and remove vase(object_9, object_0).

Goal achieved: next(object_9, object_7).
