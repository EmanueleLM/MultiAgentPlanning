Here is a clear, human-readable rendering of the given plan. Each step shows the action, its parameters, the stage/timestamp it spans, and the key state change.

1) Time s0→s1 (duration 1): clip object_10 object_5 object_9
- Preconditions used: hand(object_10), sneeze(object_5), texture(object_9), next(object_5,object_9), next(object_10,object_9)
- Effects: add vase(object_10,object_5); delete next(object_10,object_9)

2) Time s1→s2 (duration 1): wretched object_5 object_9 object_8 object_3
- Preconditions used: sneeze(object_5), texture(object_9), texture(object_8), stupendous(object_3), next(object_5,object_9), collect(object_9,object_3), collect(object_8,object_3)
- Effects: add next(object_5,object_8); delete next(object_5,object_9)

3) Time s2→s3 (duration 1): tightfisted object_10 object_5 object_8
- Preconditions used: hand(object_10), sneeze(object_5), texture(object_8), next(object_5,object_8), vase(object_10,object_5)
- Effects: add next(object_10,object_8); delete vase(object_10,object_5)

4) Time s3→s4 (duration 1): sip object_10 object_0 object_8
- Preconditions used: hand(object_10), cats(object_0), texture(object_8), next(object_10,object_8), next(object_0,object_8)
- Effects: add vase(object_10,object_0); delete next(object_10,object_8)

5) Time s4→s5 (duration 1): memory object_0 object_8 object_6
- Preconditions used: cats(object_0), spring(object_8), spring(object_6), next(object_0,object_8)
- Effects: add next(object_0,object_6); delete next(object_0,object_8)

6) Time s5→s6 (duration 1): paltry object_10 object_0 object_6
- Preconditions used: hand(object_10), cats(object_0), texture(object_6), vase(object_10,object_0), next(object_0,object_6)
- Effects: add next(object_10,object_6); delete vase(object_10,object_0)
- Goal achieved: next(object_10,object_6) is true at s6.
