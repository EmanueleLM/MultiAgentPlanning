Here is the human-readable sequence of actions that follows the given plan exactly and achieves the goal next object_10 object_6 and next object_9 object_6. Assume each action takes 1 time unit.

- t=0 → t=1: clip(object_9, object_3, object_5)
  - Uses hand object_9, sneeze object_3, texture object_5, with next object_3 object_5 and next object_9 object_5.
  - Effect: adds vase object_9 object_3; removes next object_9 object_5.

- t=1 → t=2: clip(object_10, object_3, object_5)
  - Uses hand object_10, sneeze object_3, texture object_5, with next object_3 object_5 and next object_10 object_5.
  - Effect: adds vase object_10 object_3; removes next object_10 object_5.

- t=2 → t=3: wretched(object_3, object_5, object_6, object_1)
  - Uses sneeze object_3; texture object_5 and texture object_6; stupendous object_1; collect object_5 object_1 and collect object_6 object_1; with next object_3 object_5.
  - Effect: switches next for object_3 from object_5 to object_6 (adds next object_3 object_6; removes next object_3 object_5).

- t=3 → t=4: tightfisted(object_9, object_3, object_6)
  - Uses hand object_9, sneeze object_3, texture object_6, next object_3 object_6, and vase object_9 object_3.
  - Effect: adds next object_9 object_6; removes vase object_9 object_3.

- t=4 → t=5: tightfisted(object_10, object_3, object_6)
  - Uses hand object_10, sneeze object_3, texture object_6, next object_3 object_6, and vase object_10 object_3.
  - Effect: adds next object_10 object_6; removes vase object_10 object_3.

Result: Goal achieved — next object_9 object_6 and next object_10 object_6 are both true.
