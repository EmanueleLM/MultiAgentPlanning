Here is the human-readable execution of the given plan (unit-duration steps). Each action lists its parameters and the key state change it makes.

1. t=0→1 (dur=1): wretched(a=object_5, b=object_8, c=object_9, d=object_3)
   - Effect: replaces next(object_5, object_8) with next(object_5, object_9).

2. t=1→2 (dur=1): clip(x=object_11, y=object_5, z=object_9)
   - Effect: adds vase(object_11, object_5) and deletes next(object_11, object_9).

3. t=2→3 (dur=1): wretched(a=object_5, b=object_9, c=object_8, d=object_3)
   - Effect: replaces next(object_5, object_9) with next(object_5, object_8).

4. t=3→4 (dur=1): tightfisted(x=object_11, y=object_5, z=object_8)
   - Effect: adds next(object_11, object_8) and deletes vase(object_11, object_5).

5. t=4→5 (dur=1): clip(x=object_10, y=object_4, z=object_6)
   - Effect: adds vase(object_10, object_4) and deletes next(object_10, object_6).

6. t=5→6 (dur=1): wretched(a=object_4, b=object_6, c=object_7, d=object_2)
   - Effect: replaces next(object_4, object_6) with next(object_4, object_7).

7. t=6→7 (dur=1): tightfisted(x=object_10, y=object_4, z=object_7)
   - Effect: adds next(object_10, object_7) and deletes vase(object_10, object_4).

Goal achieved:
- next(object_11, object_8) is established at step 4.
- next(object_10, object_7) is established at step 7.
