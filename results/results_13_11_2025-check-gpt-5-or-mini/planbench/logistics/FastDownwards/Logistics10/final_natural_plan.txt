Here is a human-readable execution of the provided plan (sequential, assuming unit duration per action). Each action name and its arguments exactly match the plan.

1) t=0..1, duration 1
   Action: wretched(object_5, object_8, object_9, object_3)
   Effect: Redirects next for object_5 from object_8 to object_9.

2) t=1..2, duration 1
   Action: clip(object_11, object_5, object_9)
   Effect: Creates vase(object_11, object_5) and removes next(object_11, object_9).

3) t=2..3, duration 1
   Action: wretched(object_5, object_9, object_8, object_3)
   Effect: Redirects next for object_5 from object_9 back to object_8.

4) t=3..4, duration 1
   Action: tightfisted(object_11, object_5, object_8)
   Effect: Creates next(object_11, object_8) and removes vase(object_11, object_5).

5) t=4..5, duration 1
   Action: clip(object_10, object_4, object_6)
   Effect: Creates vase(object_10, object_4) and removes next(object_10, object_6).

6) t=5..6, duration 1
   Action: wretched(object_4, object_6, object_7, object_2)
   Effect: Redirects next for object_4 from object_6 to object_7.

7) t=6..7, duration 1
   Action: tightfisted(object_10, object_4, object_7)
   Effect: Creates next(object_10, object_7) and removes vase(object_10, object_4).

Resulting goals achieved at t=7:
- next(object_11, object_8)
- next(object_10, object_7)
