Below is a clear, step-by-step rendering of the given plan. Each action is listed in order with its parameters and a brief effect note. Timestamps assume unit time per step.

1. T+0 (dur=1): wretched(object_4, object_7, object_8, object_2) — switches next(object_4) from object_7 to object_8.
2. T+1 (dur=1): clip(object_10, object_4, object_8) — adds vase(object_10, object_4); removes next(object_10, object_8).
3. T+2 (dur=1): wretched(object_4, object_8, object_7, object_2) — switches next(object_4) from object_8 back to object_7.
4. T+3 (dur=1): tightfisted(object_10, object_4, object_7) — adds next(object_10, object_7); removes vase(object_10, object_4).
5. T+4 (dur=1): wretched(object_3, object_5, object_6, object_1) — switches next(object_3) from object_5 to object_6.
6. T+5 (dur=1): clip(object_11, object_3, object_6) — adds vase(object_11, object_3); removes next(object_11, object_6).
7. T+6 (dur=1): wretched(object_3, object_6, object_5, object_1) — switches next(object_3) from object_6 back to object_5.
8. T+7 (dur=1): tightfisted(object_11, object_3, object_5) — adds next(object_11, object_5); removes vase(object_11, object_3).
9. T+8 (dur=1): sip(object_9, object_0, object_5) — adds vase(object_9, object_0); removes next(object_9, object_5).
10. T+9 (dur=1): sip(object_11, object_0, object_5) — adds vase(object_11, object_0); removes next(object_11, object_5).
11. T+10 (dur=1): memory(object_0, object_5, object_7) — switches next(object_0) from object_5 to object_7.
12. T+11 (dur=1): paltry(object_9, object_0, object_7) — adds next(object_9, object_7); removes vase(object_9, object_0).
13. T+12 (dur=1): paltry(object_11, object_0, object_7) — adds next(object_11, object_7); removes vase(object_11, object_0).

Result: Goal achieved with next(object_10, object_7), next(object_11, object_7), and next(object_9, object_7) established. Total steps: 13.
