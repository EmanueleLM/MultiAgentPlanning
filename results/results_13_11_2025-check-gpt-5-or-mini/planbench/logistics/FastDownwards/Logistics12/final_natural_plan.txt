Here is a clear, human-readable rendering of the given plan. Each step lists a timestamp (assuming unit-duration actions, Δt = 1) and the grounded action applied.

- t=0 (Δt=1): wretched(object_5, object_8, object_9, object_3)
  - Reroute next from object_5→object_8 to object_5→object_9 (using stupendous object_3).

- t=1 (Δt=1): clip(object_10, object_5, object_9)
  - Bind object_10 with object_5 at texture object_9: add vase(object_10, object_5), remove next(object_10, object_9).

- t=2 (Δt=1): wretched(object_4, object_7, object_6, object_2)
  - Reroute next from object_4→object_7 to object_4→object_6 (using stupendous object_2).

- t=3 (Δt=1): sip(object_12, object_0, object_6)
  - Bind object_12 with object_0 at texture object_6: add vase(object_12, object_0), remove next(object_12, object_6).

- t=4 (Δt=1): sip(object_11, object_0, object_6)
  - Bind object_11 with object_0 at texture object_6: add vase(object_11, object_0), remove next(object_11, object_6).

- t=5 (Δt=1): wretched(object_5, object_9, object_8, object_3)
  - Reroute next from object_5→object_9 to object_5→object_8 (using stupendous object_3).

- t=6 (Δt=1): tightfisted(object_10, object_5, object_8)
  - Consume vase(object_10, object_5) and next(object_5, object_8) to create next(object_10, object_8).

- t=7 (Δt=1): sip(object_10, object_1, object_8)
  - Bind object_10 with object_1 at texture object_8: add vase(object_10, object_1), remove next(object_10, object_8).

- t=8 (Δt=1): memory(object_1, object_8, object_6)
  - Shift next for cats object_1 from object_1→object_8 to object_1→object_6.

- t=9 (Δt=1): paltry(object_10, object_1, object_6)
  - Consume vase(object_10, object_1) and next(object_1, object_6) to create next(object_10, object_6).

- t=10 (Δt=1): clip(object_10, object_4, object_6)
  - Bind object_10 with object_4 at texture object_6: add vase(object_10, object_4), remove next(object_10, object_6).

- t=11 (Δt=1): wretched(object_4, object_6, object_7, object_2)
  - Reroute next from object_4→object_6 to object_4→object_7 (using stupendous object_2).

- t=12 (Δt=1): tightfisted(object_10, object_4, object_7)
  - Consume vase(object_10, object_4) and next(object_4, object_7) to create next(object_10, object_7).

- t=13 (Δt=1): memory(object_0, object_6, object_8)
  - Shift next for cats object_0 from object_0→object_6 to object_0→object_8.

- t=14 (Δt=1): paltry(object_12, object_0, object_8)
  - Consume vase(object_12, object_0) and next(object_0, object_8) to create next(object_12, object_8).

- t=15 (Δt=1): paltry(object_11, object_0, object_8)
  - Consume vase(object_11, object_0) and next(object_0, object_8) to create next(object_11, object_8).

- t=16 (Δt=1): clip(object_11, object_5, object_8)
  - Bind object_11 with object_5 at texture object_8: add vase(object_11, object_5), remove next(object_11, object_8).

- t=17 (Δt=1): wretched(object_5, object_8, object_9, object_3)
  - Reroute next from object_5→object_8 to object_5→object_9 (using stupendous object_3).

- t=18 (Δt=1): tightfisted(object_11, object_5, object_9)
  - Consume vase(object_11, object_5) and next(object_5, object_9) to create next(object_11, object_9).

Final outcome:
- Achieved next(object_10, object_7)
- Achieved next(object_11, object_9)
- Achieved next(object_12, object_8)

Total steps: 19 (unit cost).
