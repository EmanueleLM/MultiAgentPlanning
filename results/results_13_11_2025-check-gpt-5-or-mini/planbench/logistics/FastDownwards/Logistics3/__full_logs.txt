NATURAL-PLAN sas_plan_1
------------------------------
Goal: make next(object_8, object_6) true.

- Step 1 (t=0.0–1.0, duration 1): memory object_1 object_6 object_7
  - Preconditions (hold): cats object_1; spring object_6; spring object_7; next object_1 object_6.
  - Effects: add next object_1 object_7; delete next object_1 object_6.

- Step 2 (t=1.0–2.0, duration 1): sip object_8 object_1 object_7
  - Preconditions (hold): hand object_8; cats object_1; texture object_7; next object_8 object_7; next object_1 object_7.
  - Effects: add vase object_8 object_1; delete next object_8 object_7.

- Step 3 (t=2.0–3.0, duration 1): memory object_1 object_7 object_6
  - Preconditions (hold): cats object_1; spring object_7; spring object_6; next object_1 object_7.
  - Effects: add next object_1 object_6; delete next object_1 object_7.

- Step 4 (t=3.0–4.0, duration 1): paltry object_8 object_1 object_6
  - Preconditions (hold): hand object_8; cats object_1; texture object_6; vase object_8 object_1; next object_1 object_6.
  - Effects: add next object_8 object_6; delete vase object_8 object_1.

Result: next object_8 object_6 is achieved at t=4.0.

NATURAL-PLAN sas_plan_1
------------------------------
Here is the human-readable execution of the plan (unit-duration steps, 1 time unit each):

1) t=0–1: memory(object_0, object_6, object_5)
   - Preconditions: cats(object_0), spring(object_6), spring(object_5), next(object_0, object_6)
   - Effect: add next(object_0, object_5); remove next(object_0, object_6)

2) t=1–2: sip(object_8, object_0, object_5)
   - Preconditions: hand(object_8), cats(object_0), texture(object_5), next(object_8, object_5), next(object_0, object_5)
   - Effect: add vase(object_8, object_0); remove next(object_8, object_5)

3) t=2–3: memory(object_0, object_5, object_6)
   - Preconditions: cats(object_0), spring(object_5), spring(object_6), next(object_0, object_5)
   - Effect: add next(object_0, object_6); remove next(object_0, object_5)

4) t=3–4: paltry(object_8, object_0, object_6)
   - Preconditions: hand(object_8), cats(object_0), texture(object_6), vase(object_8, object_0), next(object_0, object_6)
   - Effect: add next(object_8, object_6); remove vase(object_8, object_0)

Goal satisfied at t=4:
- next(object_7, object_6) remains true from the start, and
- next(object_8, object_6) is established in Step 4.

FINAL-PLAN
------------------------------
I’m missing the normalized action schema and the Scenario 2 instance details. Without them, I can’t produce a faithful, constraint-tight STRIPS PDDL without inventing predicates, actions, objects, or connectivity.

Please provide the following so I can deliver the final Fast Downward–compatible domain and problem:

- Predicates: the complete declared predicate list (names, arguments over a single type obj).
- Actions: each action’s name, parameters (typed as obj), preconditions, add effects, and delete effects. Note any negative preconditions explicitly.
- Objects: all Scenario 2 objects (typed as obj).
- Init: all true initial facts over those objects.
- Goal: all required terminal facts. If an ordered sequence is mandated, include the ordering constraints so I can encode them as explicit predicates or goal conditions.
- Timeline/slots/phases: if Scenario 2 enumerates discrete phases, days, or time slots, list them and the required contiguity/order so I can model successor links and forbid ping-pong transitions.
- Hard constraints derived from preferences (avoid/would rather/earliest/exactly/at most), so I can encode them directly rather than via penalties.
- Any genuine cost model (only if required), otherwise I’ll omit :action-costs.

Once you share these, I’ll return a single-type, fully expanded STRIPS PDDL domain and matching problem, enclosed in <domain></domain> and <problem></problem>, with only :strips, :typing, and :negative-preconditions (and :action-costs if truly needed), and with all ordering and constraints enforced so infeasible plans are impossible.

NATURAL-PLAN sas_plan_1
------------------------------
Human-readable execution plan (each step starts at the given timestamp and takes duration 1)

- t=0, dur=1: Execute sip with parameters (object_8, object_0, object_6).
  Effect: creates vase(object_8, object_0); removes next(object_8, object_6).

- t=1, dur=1: Execute sip with parameters (object_7, object_0, object_6).
  Effect: creates vase(object_7, object_0); removes next(object_7, object_6).

- t=2, dur=1: Execute memory with parameters (object_0, object_6, object_5).
  Effect: adds next(object_0, object_5); removes next(object_0, object_6).

- t=3, dur=1: Execute paltry with parameters (object_8, object_0, object_5).
  Effect: adds next(object_8, object_5); removes vase(object_8, object_0).

- t=4, dur=1: Execute paltry with parameters (object_7, object_0, object_5).
  Effect: adds next(object_7, object_5); removes vase(object_7, object_0).

Outcome: Goal achieved — next(object_7, object_5) and next(object_8, object_5) both hold.

NATURAL-PLAN sas_plan_1
------------------------------
Here is the human-readable execution of the plan that achieves the goal:

1) t=0, duration=1: (sip object_8 object_0 object_6)
   Effects: add (vase object_8 object_0); del (next object_8 object_6)

2) t=1, duration=1: (sip object_7 object_0 object_6)
   Effects: add (vase object_7 object_0); del (next object_7 object_6)

3) t=2, duration=1: (memory object_0 object_6 object_5)
   Effects: add (next object_0 object_5); del (next object_0 object_6)

4) t=3, duration=1: (paltry object_8 object_0 object_5)
   Effects: add (next object_8 object_5); del (vase object_8 object_0)

5) t=4, duration=1: (paltry object_7 object_0 object_5)
   Effects: add (next object_7 object_5); del (vase object_7 object_0)

Final goal reached: (next object_7 object_5) and (next object_8 object_5).
Total actions: 5; total time (assuming unit durations): 5.
