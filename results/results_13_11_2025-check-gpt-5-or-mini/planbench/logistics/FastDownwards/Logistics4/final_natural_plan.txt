Here is the human-readable execution of the given plan, with unit-duration steps and timestamps.

- t=0 → t=1: Execute memory(object_1, object_6, object_7)
  - Preconditions: object_1 is a cat; object_6 and object_7 are spring; next(object_1, object_6) holds.
  - Effect: Move the “next” relation for object_1 from object_6 to object_7.
    - Adds: next(object_1, object_7)
    - Deletes: next(object_1, object_6)

- t=1 → t=2: Execute sip(object_9, object_1, object_7)
  - Preconditions: object_9 has hand; object_1 is a cat; object_7 has texture; next(object_9, object_7) and next(object_1, object_7) hold.
  - Effect: Create a vase link between object_9 and object_1; remove next(object_9, object_7).
    - Adds: vase(object_9, object_1)
    - Deletes: next(object_9, object_7)

- t=2 → t=3: Execute memory(object_1, object_7, object_6)
  - Preconditions: object_1 is a cat; object_7 and object_6 are spring; next(object_1, object_7) holds.
  - Effect: Move the “next” relation for object_1 from object_7 back to object_6.
    - Adds: next(object_1, object_6)
    - Deletes: next(object_1, object_7)

- t=3 → t=4: Execute paltry(object_9, object_1, object_6)
  - Preconditions: object_9 has hand; object_1 is a cat; object_6 has texture; vase(object_9, object_1) holds; next(object_1, object_6) holds.
  - Effect: Make object_9 next to object_6; remove the vase link between object_9 and object_1.
    - Adds: next(object_9, object_6)
    - Deletes: vase(object_9, object_1)

Goal achieved at t=4:
- next(object_8, object_7) remains true throughout.
- next(object_9, object_6) becomes true after the final step.
