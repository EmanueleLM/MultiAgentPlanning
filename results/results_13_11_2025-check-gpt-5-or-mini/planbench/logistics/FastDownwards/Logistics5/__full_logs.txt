NATURAL-PLAN sas_plan_1
------------------------------
Goal: make next(object_8, object_6) true.

- Step 1 (t=0.0–1.0, duration 1): memory object_1 object_6 object_7
  - Preconditions (hold): cats object_1; spring object_6; spring object_7; next object_1 object_6.
  - Effects: add next object_1 object_7; delete next object_1 object_6.

- Step 2 (t=1.0–2.0, duration 1): sip object_8 object_1 object_7
  - Preconditions (hold): hand object_8; cats object_1; texture object_7; next object_8 object_7; next object_1 object_7.
  - Effects: add vase object_8 object_1; delete next object_8 object_7.

- Step 3 (t=2.0–3.0, duration 1): memory object_1 object_7 object_6
  - Preconditions (hold): cats object_1; spring object_7; spring object_6; next object_1 object_7.
  - Effects: add next object_1 object_6; delete next object_1 object_7.

- Step 4 (t=3.0–4.0, duration 1): paltry object_8 object_1 object_6
  - Preconditions (hold): hand object_8; cats object_1; texture object_6; vase object_8 object_1; next object_1 object_6.
  - Effects: add next object_8 object_6; delete vase object_8 object_1.

Result: next object_8 object_6 is achieved at t=4.0.

NATURAL-PLAN sas_plan_1
------------------------------
Here is the human-readable execution of the plan (unit-duration steps, 1 time unit each):

1) t=0–1: memory(object_0, object_6, object_5)
   - Preconditions: cats(object_0), spring(object_6), spring(object_5), next(object_0, object_6)
   - Effect: add next(object_0, object_5); remove next(object_0, object_6)

2) t=1–2: sip(object_8, object_0, object_5)
   - Preconditions: hand(object_8), cats(object_0), texture(object_5), next(object_8, object_5), next(object_0, object_5)
   - Effect: add vase(object_8, object_0); remove next(object_8, object_5)

3) t=2–3: memory(object_0, object_5, object_6)
   - Preconditions: cats(object_0), spring(object_5), spring(object_6), next(object_0, object_5)
   - Effect: add next(object_0, object_6); remove next(object_0, object_5)

4) t=3–4: paltry(object_8, object_0, object_6)
   - Preconditions: hand(object_8), cats(object_0), texture(object_6), vase(object_8, object_0), next(object_0, object_6)
   - Effect: add next(object_8, object_6); remove vase(object_8, object_0)

Goal satisfied at t=4:
- next(object_7, object_6) remains true from the start, and
- next(object_8, object_6) is established in Step 4.

FINAL-PLAN
------------------------------
I’m missing the normalized action schema and the Scenario 2 instance details. Without them, I can’t produce a faithful, constraint-tight STRIPS PDDL without inventing predicates, actions, objects, or connectivity.

Please provide the following so I can deliver the final Fast Downward–compatible domain and problem:

- Predicates: the complete declared predicate list (names, arguments over a single type obj).
- Actions: each action’s name, parameters (typed as obj), preconditions, add effects, and delete effects. Note any negative preconditions explicitly.
- Objects: all Scenario 2 objects (typed as obj).
- Init: all true initial facts over those objects.
- Goal: all required terminal facts. If an ordered sequence is mandated, include the ordering constraints so I can encode them as explicit predicates or goal conditions.
- Timeline/slots/phases: if Scenario 2 enumerates discrete phases, days, or time slots, list them and the required contiguity/order so I can model successor links and forbid ping-pong transitions.
- Hard constraints derived from preferences (avoid/would rather/earliest/exactly/at most), so I can encode them directly rather than via penalties.
- Any genuine cost model (only if required), otherwise I’ll omit :action-costs.

Once you share these, I’ll return a single-type, fully expanded STRIPS PDDL domain and matching problem, enclosed in <domain></domain> and <problem></problem>, with only :strips, :typing, and :negative-preconditions (and :action-costs if truly needed), and with all ordering and constraints enforced so infeasible plans are impossible.

NATURAL-PLAN sas_plan_1
------------------------------
Human-readable execution plan (each step starts at the given timestamp and takes duration 1)

- t=0, dur=1: Execute sip with parameters (object_8, object_0, object_6).
  Effect: creates vase(object_8, object_0); removes next(object_8, object_6).

- t=1, dur=1: Execute sip with parameters (object_7, object_0, object_6).
  Effect: creates vase(object_7, object_0); removes next(object_7, object_6).

- t=2, dur=1: Execute memory with parameters (object_0, object_6, object_5).
  Effect: adds next(object_0, object_5); removes next(object_0, object_6).

- t=3, dur=1: Execute paltry with parameters (object_8, object_0, object_5).
  Effect: adds next(object_8, object_5); removes vase(object_8, object_0).

- t=4, dur=1: Execute paltry with parameters (object_7, object_0, object_5).
  Effect: adds next(object_7, object_5); removes vase(object_7, object_0).

Outcome: Goal achieved — next(object_7, object_5) and next(object_8, object_5) both hold.

================================================================================


FINAL-PLAN
------------------------------
I’m missing the concrete action schemas, scenarios, and audit findings. To generate a single coherent PDDL domain and per-scenario problems compatible with FastDownward (STRIPS), please provide the following:

1) Actions and predicates
- Predicates: full list with argument types; note which are static (never deleted).
- Actions: for each action
  - name and parameters (with types)
  - preconditions (including negative ones if any)
  - effects (add/delete), and any derived ordering/phase constraints it must respect
  - any mutual-exclusion or invariants (e.g., resource capacities) that must be encoded as state constraints

2) Types and objects
- Types hierarchy (if any).
- For each scenario: concrete objects per type (no placeholders).

3) Timeline/phase structure (if applicable)
- Discrete phases, days, or time slots; their exact order and contiguity requirements.
- “Earliest/exactly/at most” timing preferences to be enforced as hard constraints.

4) Audit findings (hard constraints to enforce)
- Prohibited actions or sequences
- Required orderings (must precede/follow), mandatory checkpoints
- Capacity limits, availability windows, exclusivity, segregation-of-duty
- Final state requirements (e.g., final locations, completed tasks that must hold in goal)
- Any “avoid/would rather” preferences to be treated as strict constraints

5) Scenarios (each becomes a problem file)
For each scenario, specify:
- :objects list (concrete objects)
- :init facts (including static links like adjacency, successor(dayX, dayY), capacities encoded as predicates, etc.)
- :goal facts, fully specifying all mandated terminal conditions
- If costs are required, confirm that action costs are needed; otherwise I will omit :action-costs entirely.

Notes I will follow:
- Requirements limited to :strips, :typing, :negative-preconditions (and :action-costs only if you request costs).
- No placeholder tokens, no penalty/shortfall/quota “bookkeeping”.
- Ordered sequences and contiguity will be enforced via explicit predicates and goals so plans cannot reorder steps.

Once you share these details (or a structured description I can translate), I’ll produce one domain and a separate problem for each scenario, ready for FastDownward.

NATURAL-PLAN sas_plan_10
------------------------------
Here is the human-readable execution of the given plan, with unit-duration steps and timestamps.

- t=0 → t=1: Execute memory(object_1, object_6, object_7)
  - Preconditions: object_1 is a cat; object_6 and object_7 are spring; next(object_1, object_6) holds.
  - Effect: Move the “next” relation for object_1 from object_6 to object_7.
    - Adds: next(object_1, object_7)
    - Deletes: next(object_1, object_6)

- t=1 → t=2: Execute sip(object_9, object_1, object_7)
  - Preconditions: object_9 has hand; object_1 is a cat; object_7 has texture; next(object_9, object_7) and next(object_1, object_7) hold.
  - Effect: Create a vase link between object_9 and object_1; remove next(object_9, object_7).
    - Adds: vase(object_9, object_1)
    - Deletes: next(object_9, object_7)

- t=2 → t=3: Execute memory(object_1, object_7, object_6)
  - Preconditions: object_1 is a cat; object_7 and object_6 are spring; next(object_1, object_7) holds.
  - Effect: Move the “next” relation for object_1 from object_7 back to object_6.
    - Adds: next(object_1, object_6)
    - Deletes: next(object_1, object_7)

- t=3 → t=4: Execute paltry(object_9, object_1, object_6)
  - Preconditions: object_9 has hand; object_1 is a cat; object_6 has texture; vase(object_9, object_1) holds; next(object_1, object_6) holds.
  - Effect: Make object_9 next to object_6; remove the vase link between object_9 and object_1.
    - Adds: next(object_9, object_6)
    - Deletes: vase(object_9, object_1)

Goal achieved at t=4:
- next(object_8, object_7) remains true throughout.
- next(object_9, object_6) becomes true after the final step.

FINAL-PLAN
------------------------------
I’m missing the “domain_spec” and “audited_instances” you referenced. Those are needed to know the exact predicate symbols, object names, actions, and constraints so I can produce a solver-compatible PDDL domain and two complete problems without inventing anything.

Please provide:
- The domain_spec: actions (with preconditions/effects), predicates (names and argument types), types, and any ordering/timeline structure that must be enforced.
- The audited_instances: complete object lists and initial facts for Scenario A and Scenario B, plus the required goals and any hard constraints/preferences (e.g., earliest/exactly/at most) that must be modeled as strict constraints.

If it helps, you can paste them verbatim. I will then integrate them into:
- One PDDL domain enclosed in <domain>…</domain>
- Two PDDL problems (Scenario A and Scenario B) enclosed in <problem id="A">…</problem> and <problem id="B">…</problem>
with only :strips, :typing, and (if truly required) :negative-preconditions in :requirements, no placeholders, no post-hoc penalties, and explicit ordering/timeline predicates as needed.

------------------------------
Human-readable execution plan (assume each action takes 1 time unit)

- Step 1 (t=0 → t=1): clip(object_9, object_4, object_7)
  Description: With hand(object_9), sneeze(object_4), texture(object_7), next(object_4, object_7), and next(object_9, object_7) true, create vase(object_9, object_4) and remove next(object_9, object_7).

- Step 2 (t=1 → t=2): wretched(object_4, object_7, object_8, object_2)
  Description: Using sneeze(object_4), texture(object_7), texture(object_8), stupendous(object_2), next(object_4, object_7), collect(object_7, object_2), and collect(object_8, object_2), change linkage to add next(object_4, object_8) and remove next(object_4, object_7).

- Step 3 (t=2 → t=3): tightfisted(object_9, object_4, object_8)
  Description: With hand(object_9), sneeze(object_4), texture(object_8), next(object_4, object_8), and vase(object_9, object_4), establish next(object_9, object_8) and remove vase(object_9, object_4). Goal achieved: next(object_9, object_8).
