Goal: achieve next(object_9, object_7)

1. t=0–1 (dur=1): wretched(object_3, object_5, object_6, object_1) -> adds next(object_3, object_6); removes next(object_3, object_5).
2. t=1–2 (dur=1): clip(object_9, object_3, object_6) -> adds vase(object_9, object_3); removes next(object_9, object_6).
3. t=2–3 (dur=1): wretched(object_3, object_6, object_5, object_1) -> adds next(object_3, object_5); removes next(object_3, object_6).
4. t=3–4 (dur=1): tightfisted(object_9, object_3, object_5) -> adds next(object_9, object_5); removes vase(object_9, object_3).
5. t=4–5 (dur=1): sip(object_9, object_0, object_5) -> adds vase(object_9, object_0); removes next(object_9, object_5).
6. t=5–6 (dur=1): memory(object_0, object_5, object_7) -> adds next(object_0, object_7); removes next(object_0, object_5).
7. t=6–7 (dur=1): paltry(object_9, object_0, object_7) -> adds next(object_9, object_7); removes vase(object_9, object_0).

Result: next(object_9, object_7) holds.
