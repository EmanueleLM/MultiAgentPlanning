Here is a clear, human-readable rendering of the given plan. Each action matches the plan exactly and uses 1 time unit.

1) t=0→1, action: clip(object_10, object_5, object_9)
- Effect: add vase(object_10, object_5); delete next(object_10, object_9).

2) t=1→2, action: wretched(object_5, object_9, object_8, object_3)
- Effect: add next(object_5, object_8); delete next(object_5, object_9).

3) t=2→3, action: tightfisted(object_10, object_5, object_8)
- Effect: add next(object_10, object_8); delete vase(object_10, object_5).

4) t=3→4, action: sip(object_10, object_0, object_8)
- Effect: add vase(object_10, object_0); delete next(object_10, object_8).

5) t=4→5, action: memory(object_0, object_8, object_6)
- Effect: add next(object_0, object_6); delete next(object_0, object_8).

6) t=5→6, action: paltry(object_10, object_0, object_6)
- Effect: add next(object_10, object_6); delete vase(object_10, object_0).

Result at t=6: Goal achieved — next(object_10, object_6) holds.
