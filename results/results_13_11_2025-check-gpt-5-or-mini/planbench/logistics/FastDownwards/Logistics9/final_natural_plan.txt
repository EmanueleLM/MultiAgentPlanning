Here is the human-readable execution of the plan, following the given sequence exactly. Assume each action takes 1 time unit.

1) t=0..1 — wretched object_5 object_8 object_9 object_3
- Reroute the “next” link for object_5 from object_8 to object_9 (using stupendous object_3 and the required collections).
- Effect: add next(object_5, object_9); delete next(object_5, object_8).

2) t=1..2 — clip object_11 object_5 object_9
- Pair hand-held object_11 with sneezer object_5 at texture object_9, consuming object_11’s link to 9.
- Effect: add vase(object_11, object_5); delete next(object_11, object_9).

3) t=2..3 — wretched object_5 object_9 object_8 object_3
- Reroute the “next” link for object_5 from object_9 back to object_8 (again via stupendous object_3).
- Effect: add next(object_5, object_8); delete next(object_5, object_9).

4) t=3..4 — tightfisted object_11 object_5 object_8
- Use the vase link between object_11 and object_5 while object_5 points to texture object_8 to move object_11’s link to 8.
- Effect: add next(object_11, object_8); delete vase(object_11, object_5).

5) t=4..5 — clip object_10 object_4 object_6
- Pair hand-held object_10 with sneezer object_4 at texture object_6, consuming object_10’s link to 6.
- Effect: add vase(object_10, object_4); delete next(object_10, object_6).

6) t=5..6 — wretched object_4 object_6 object_7 object_2
- Reroute the “next” link for object_4 from object_6 to object_7 (using stupendous object_2 and the required collections).
- Effect: add next(object_4, object_7); delete next(object_4, object_6).

7) t=6..7 — tightfisted object_10 object_4 object_7
- Use the vase link between object_10 and object_4 while object_4 points to texture object_7 to move object_10’s link to 7.
- Effect: add next(object_10, object_7); delete vase(object_10, object_4).

Goal achieved at t=7: next(object_10, object_7) and next(object_11, object_8).
