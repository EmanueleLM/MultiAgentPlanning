Here is the human-readable sequence that follows the plan exactly and achieves the goal next object_8 object_6:

1) Time 0.0–1.0 (duration 1): Execute sip(object_8, object_1, object_7)
   - Preconditions used: hand object_8, cats object_1, texture object_7, next object_8 object_7, next object_1 object_7
   - Effects: adds vase object_8 object_1; removes next object_8 object_7

2) Time 1.0–2.0 (duration 1): Execute memory(object_1, object_7, object_6)
   - Preconditions used: cats object_1, spring object_7, spring object_6, next object_1 object_7
   - Effects: adds next object_1 object_6; removes next object_1 object_7

3) Time 2.0–3.0 (duration 1): Execute paltry(object_8, object_1, object_6)
   - Preconditions used: hand object_8, cats object_1, texture object_6, vase object_8 object_1, next object_1 object_6
   - Effects: adds next object_8 object_6; removes vase object_8 object_1

Goal achieved: next object_8 object_6.
