FINAL-PLAN
------------------------------
I’m missing the concrete action_model, scenario_2, and audit_report content needed to build a faithful and solver-compatible PDDL. Please provide or confirm the following so I can emit the final domain and problem you requested:

1) Action model (exact tokens, lowercase)
- Full predicate vocabulary (names, argument lists, and any typing).
- All six actions paltry, sip, clip, wretched, memory, tightfisted with:
  - Parameters (with types if any).
  - Preconditions (no negative preconditions unless explicitly intended).
  - Effects (add/delete lists; if action costs are required, specify numeric fluents and increases).

2) scenario_2 (initial state and goal)
- Complete set of initial facts over objects object_0 … object_8 (and any additional typed objects, if applicable).
- Complete goal conditions. If there is an implied order or phased timeline, enumerate the phases/slots and their successor relation so I can enforce contiguity and ordering as hard constraints.

3) audit_report constraints
- Any hard constraints, preferences to be treated as hard (avoid/would rather/earliest/exactly/at most), mutual exclusions, capacities, or forbidden states that must be encoded directly (not via penalties or quota tokens).

4) Typing and objects
- Confirm whether all objects are of a single type (e.g., object), or provide the type hierarchy for object_0 … object_8 and any other constants required by the action model.

5) Costs (optional)
- If you require action costs, specify the metric and per-action cost so I can add matching (increase ...) effects and a :metric minimize total-cost in the problem; otherwise I will omit costs.

Once I have these specifics, I will return:
- <domain> … </domain> with name mystery-blocks, using only :strips, :typing, and (if you confirm) :negative-preconditions (and :action-costs only if needed).
- <problem> … </problem> named scenario-2 with objects object_0 … object_8, a fully enumerated initial state from scenario_2, and a goal that fixes every mandated terminal condition and enforces required ordering.

NATURAL-PLAN sas_plan_1
------------------------------
Here is the human-readable sequence that follows the plan exactly and achieves the goal next object_8 object_6:

1) Time 0.0–1.0 (duration 1): Execute sip(object_8, object_1, object_7)
   - Preconditions used: hand object_8, cats object_1, texture object_7, next object_8 object_7, next object_1 object_7
   - Effects: adds vase object_8 object_1; removes next object_8 object_7

2) Time 1.0–2.0 (duration 1): Execute memory(object_1, object_7, object_6)
   - Preconditions used: cats object_1, spring object_7, spring object_6, next object_1 object_7
   - Effects: adds next object_1 object_6; removes next object_1 object_7

3) Time 2.0–3.0 (duration 1): Execute paltry(object_8, object_1, object_6)
   - Preconditions used: hand object_8, cats object_1, texture object_6, vase object_8 object_1, next object_1 object_6
   - Effects: adds next object_8 object_6; removes vase object_8 object_1

Goal achieved: next object_8 object_6.

PROBLEM
------------------------------
I am playing with a set of objects. Here are the actions I can do

Paltry object_0 object_1 object_2.

I have the following restrictions on my actions:
To perform paltry action, the following facts need to be true: hand object_0, cats object_1, texture object_2, vase object_0 object_1, and next object_1 object_2
Once paltry is performed the following facts will be true: next object_0 object_2
Once paltry is performed the following facts will be false: vase object_0 object_1
To perform sip action, the following facts need to be true: hand object_0, cats object_1, texture object_2, next object_0 object_2, and next object_1 object_2
Once sip is performed the following facts will be true: vase object_0 object_1
Once sip is performed the following facts will be false: next object_0 object_2
To perform clip action, the following facts need to be true: hand object_0, sneeze object_1, texture object_2, next object_1 object_2, and next object_0 object_2
Once clip is performed the following facts will be true: vase object_0 object_1
Once clip is performed the following facts will be false: next object_0 object_2
To perform wretched action, the following facts need to be true: sneeze object_0, texture object_1, texture object_2, stupendous object_3, next object_0 object_1, collect object_1 object_3, and collect object_2 object_3
Once wretched is performed the following facts will be true: next object_0 object_2

NATURAL-PLAN sas_plan_1
------------------------------
Here is the human-readable execution of the provided plan. All actions are instantaneous; we annotate each with a timestamp (t) and duration 1 time unit.

1) t=0, duration=1: memory(object_0, object_6, object_5)
- Effect: replace next(object_0, object_6) with next(object_0, object_5).

2) t=1, duration=1: sip(object_8, object_0, object_5)
- Effect: add vase(object_8, object_0); delete next(object_8, object_5).

3) t=2, duration=1: memory(object_0, object_5, object_6)
- Effect: replace next(object_0, object_5) with next(object_0, object_6).

4) t=3, duration=1: paltry(object_8, object_0, object_6)
- Effect: add next(object_8, object_6); delete vase(object_8, object_0).

Outcome: Goal achieved. next(object_7, object_6) was already true initially and remains true; next(object_8, object_6) becomes true at t=3.
