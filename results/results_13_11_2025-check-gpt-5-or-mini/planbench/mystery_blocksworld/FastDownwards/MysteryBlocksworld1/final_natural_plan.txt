Here is the human-readable execution of the provided plan. All actions are instantaneous; we annotate each with a timestamp (t) and duration 1 time unit.

1) t=0, duration=1: memory(object_0, object_6, object_5)
- Effect: replace next(object_0, object_6) with next(object_0, object_5).

2) t=1, duration=1: sip(object_8, object_0, object_5)
- Effect: add vase(object_8, object_0); delete next(object_8, object_5).

3) t=2, duration=1: memory(object_0, object_5, object_6)
- Effect: replace next(object_0, object_5) with next(object_0, object_6).

4) t=3, duration=1: paltry(object_8, object_0, object_6)
- Effect: add next(object_8, object_6); delete vase(object_8, object_0).

Outcome: Goal achieved. next(object_7, object_6) was already true initially and remains true; next(object_8, object_6) becomes true at t=3.
