Here is the human-readable sequence that follows the given plan exactly. Each step includes a timestamp (unit duration = 1):

1. t=0–1: wretched object_4 object_7 object_8 object_2 — Shift next for object_4 from object_7 to object_8.
2. t=1–2: clip object_10 object_4 object_8 — Bind object_10 to object_4 (vase), removing next(object_10, object_8).
3. t=2–3: wretched object_4 object_8 object_7 object_2 — Shift next for object_4 back from object_8 to object_7.
4. t=3–4: tightfisted object_10 object_4 object_7 — Use the vase link to set next(object_10, object_7) and clear the vase.
5. t=4–5: wretched object_3 object_5 object_6 object_1 — Shift next for object_3 from object_5 to object_6.
6. t=5–6: clip object_11 object_3 object_6 — Bind object_11 to object_3 (vase), removing next(object_11, object_6).
7. t=6–7: wretched object_3 object_6 object_5 object_1 — Shift next for object_3 back from object_6 to object_5.
8. t=7–8: tightfisted object_11 object_3 object_5 — Use the vase link to set next(object_11, object_5) and clear the vase.
9. t=8–9: sip object_9 object_0 object_5 — Create vase(object_9, object_0), removing next(object_9, object_5).
10. t=9–10: sip object_11 object_0 object_5 — Create vase(object_11, object_0), removing next(object_11, object_5).
11. t=10–11: memory object_0 object_5 object_7 — Move next(object_0, …) from object_5 to object_7.
12. t=11–12: paltry object_9 object_0 object_7 — Use vase(object_9, object_0) and next(object_0, object_7) to set next(object_9, object_7); remove the vase.
13. t=12–13: paltry object_11 object_0 object_7 — Use vase(object_11, object_0) and next(object_0, object_7) to set next(object_11, object_7); remove the vase.

Goal achieved: next(object_10, object_7), next(object_11, object_7), and next(object_9, object_7).
