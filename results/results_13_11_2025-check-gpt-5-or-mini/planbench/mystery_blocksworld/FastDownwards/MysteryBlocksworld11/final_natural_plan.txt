Here is the human-readable execution of the provided plan, step by step. Each action matches the plan exactly and uses unit durations.

1) t=0, dur=1 — wretched object_4 object_7 object_8 object_2
   Effect: add next(object_4, object_8); remove next(object_4, object_7).

2) t=1, dur=1 — clip object_10 object_4 object_8
   Effect: add vase(object_10, object_4); remove next(object_10, object_8).

3) t=2, dur=1 — wretched object_4 object_8 object_7 object_2
   Effect: add next(object_4, object_7); remove next(object_4, object_8).

4) t=3, dur=1 — tightfisted object_10 object_4 object_7
   Effect: add next(object_10, object_7); remove vase(object_10, object_4).

5) t=4, dur=1 — wretched object_3 object_5 object_6 object_1
   Effect: add next(object_3, object_6); remove next(object_3, object_5).

6) t=5, dur=1 — clip object_11 object_3 object_6
   Effect: add vase(object_11, object_3); remove next(object_11, object_6).

7) t=6, dur=1 — wretched object_3 object_6 object_5 object_1
   Effect: add next(object_3, object_5); remove next(object_3, object_6).

8) t=7, dur=1 — tightfisted object_11 object_3 object_5
   Effect: add next(object_11, object_5); remove vase(object_11, object_3).

9) t=8, dur=1 — sip object_9 object_0 object_5
   Effect: add vase(object_9, object_0); remove next(object_9, object_5).

10) t=9, dur=1 — sip object_11 object_0 object_5
    Effect: add vase(object_11, object_0); remove next(object_11, object_5).

11) t=10, dur=1 — memory object_0 object_5 object_7
    Effect: add next(object_0, object_7); remove next(object_0, object_5).

12) t=11, dur=1 — paltry object_9 object_0 object_7
    Effect: add next(object_9, object_7); remove vase(object_9, object_0).

13) t=12, dur=1 — paltry object_11 object_0 object_7
    Effect: add next(object_11, object_7); remove vase(object_11, object_0).

Goal achieved at t=13:
- next(object_10, object_7)
- next(object_11, object_7)
- next(object_9, object_7)
