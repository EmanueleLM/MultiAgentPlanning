Here is a clear, human-readable rendition of the plan. Assume each action takes 1 time unit; timestamps are cumulative.

1) t=0→1 (dur=1): wretched(object_5, object_8, object_9, object_3)
   - Effect: replace next(object_5, object_8) with next(object_5, object_9).

2) t=1→2 (dur=1): clip(object_10, object_5, object_9)
   - Effect: add vase(object_10, object_5) and delete next(object_10, object_9).

3) t=2→3 (dur=1): wretched(object_4, object_7, object_6, object_2)
   - Effect: replace next(object_4, object_7) with next(object_4, object_6).

4) t=3→4 (dur=1): sip(object_12, object_0, object_6)
   - Effect: add vase(object_12, object_0) and delete next(object_12, object_6).

5) t=4→5 (dur=1): sip(object_11, object_0, object_6)
   - Effect: add vase(object_11, object_0) and delete next(object_11, object_6).

6) t=5→6 (dur=1): wretched(object_5, object_9, object_8, object_3)
   - Effect: replace next(object_5, object_9) with next(object_5, object_8).

7) t=6→7 (dur=1): tightfisted(object_10, object_5, object_8)
   - Effect: add next(object_10, object_8) and delete vase(object_10, object_5).

8) t=7→8 (dur=1): sip(object_10, object_1, object_8)
   - Effect: add vase(object_10, object_1) and delete next(object_10, object_8).

9) t=8→9 (dur=1): memory(object_1, object_8, object_6)
   - Effect: replace next(object_1, object_8) with next(object_1, object_6).

10) t=9→10 (dur=1): paltry(object_10, object_1, object_6)
    - Effect: add next(object_10, object_6) and delete vase(object_10, object_1).

11) t=10→11 (dur=1): clip(object_10, object_4, object_6)
    - Effect: add vase(object_10, object_4) and delete next(object_10, object_6).

12) t=11→12 (dur=1): wretched(object_4, object_6, object_7, object_2)
    - Effect: replace next(object_4, object_6) with next(object_4, object_7).

13) t=12→13 (dur=1): tightfisted(object_10, object_4, object_7)
    - Effect: add next(object_10, object_7) and delete vase(object_10, object_4).

14) t=13→14 (dur=1): memory(object_0, object_6, object_8)
    - Effect: replace next(object_0, object_6) with next(object_0, object_8).

15) t=14→15 (dur=1): paltry(object_12, object_0, object_8)
    - Effect: add next(object_12, object_8) and delete vase(object_12, object_0).

16) t=15→16 (dur=1): paltry(object_11, object_0, object_8)
    - Effect: add next(object_11, object_8) and delete vase(object_11, object_0).

17) t=16→17 (dur=1): clip(object_11, object_5, object_8)
    - Effect: add vase(object_11, object_5) and delete next(object_11, object_8).

18) t=17→18 (dur=1): wretched(object_5, object_8, object_9, object_3)
    - Effect: replace next(object_5, object_8) with next(object_5, object_9).

19) t=18→19 (dur=1): tightfisted(object_11, object_5, object_9)
    - Effect: add next(object_11, object_9) and delete vase(object_11, object_5).

Final goals satisfied:
- next(object_10, object_7)
- next(object_11, object_9)
- next(object_12, object_8)
