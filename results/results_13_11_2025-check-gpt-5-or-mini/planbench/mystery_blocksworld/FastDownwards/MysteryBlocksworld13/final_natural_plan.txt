Here is the human-readable sequence of actions that follows the provided plan exactly and includes stage timestamps:

- Step 1 (t00→t01): sip(object_11, object_0, object_6). Adds vase(object_11, object_0); deletes next(object_11, object_6).
- Step 2 (t01→t02): memory(object_0, object_6, object_8). Adds next(object_0, object_8); deletes next(object_0, object_6).
- Step 3 (t02→t03): paltry(object_11, object_0, object_8). Adds next(object_11, object_8); deletes vase(object_11, object_0).
- Step 4 (t03→t04): clip(object_11, object_5, object_8). Adds vase(object_11, object_5); deletes next(object_11, object_8).
- Step 5 (t04→t05): wretched(object_5, object_8, object_9, object_3). Adds next(object_5, object_9); deletes next(object_5, object_8).
- Step 6 (t05→t06): clip(object_10, object_5, object_9). Adds vase(object_10, object_5); deletes next(object_10, object_9).
- Step 7 (t06→t07): tightfisted(object_11, object_5, object_9). Adds next(object_11, object_9); deletes vase(object_11, object_5).
- Step 8 (t07→t08): wretched(object_4, object_7, object_6, object_2). Adds next(object_4, object_6); deletes next(object_4, object_7).
- Step 9 (t08→t09): wretched(object_5, object_9, object_8, object_3). Adds next(object_5, object_8); deletes next(object_5, object_9).
- Step 10 (t09→t10): tightfisted(object_10, object_5, object_8). Adds next(object_10, object_8); deletes vase(object_10, object_5).
- Step 11 (t10→t11): sip(object_10, object_0, object_8). Adds vase(object_10, object_0); deletes next(object_10, object_8).
- Step 12 (t11→t12): memory(object_0, object_8, object_6). Adds next(object_0, object_6); deletes next(object_0, object_8).
- Step 13 (t12→t13): paltry(object_10, object_0, object_6). Adds next(object_10, object_6); deletes vase(object_10, object_0).
- Step 14 (t13→t14): sip(object_12, object_0, object_6). Adds vase(object_12, object_0); deletes next(object_12, object_6).
- Step 15 (t14→t15): memory(object_0, object_6, object_8). Adds next(object_0, object_8); deletes next(object_0, object_6).
- Step 16 (t15→t16): paltry(object_12, object_0, object_8). Adds next(object_12, object_8); deletes vase(object_12, object_0).
- Step 17 (t16→t17): clip(object_10, object_4, object_6). Adds vase(object_10, object_4); deletes next(object_10, object_6).
- Step 18 (t17→t18): wretched(object_4, object_6, object_7, object_2). Adds next(object_4, object_7); deletes next(object_4, object_6).
- Step 19 (t18→t19): tightfisted(object_10, object_4, object_7). Adds next(object_10, object_7); deletes vase(object_10, object_4).

Final goals achieved after Step 19:
- next(object_10, object_7)
- next(object_11, object_9)
- next(object_12, object_8)
