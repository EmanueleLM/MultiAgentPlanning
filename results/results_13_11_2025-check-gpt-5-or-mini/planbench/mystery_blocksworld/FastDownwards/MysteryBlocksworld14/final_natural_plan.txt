Here is the human-readable sequence of actions that follows the provided plan exactly. Each step is sequential with unit duration.

- Step 1 — t=0 to t=1: clip(object_11, object_5, object_9)
- Step 2 — t=1 to t=2: wretched(object_5, object_9, object_8, object_3)
- Step 3 — t=2 to t=3: tightfisted(object_11, object_5, object_8)
- Step 4 — t=3 to t=4: clip(object_12, object_4, object_6)
- Step 5 — t=4 to t=5: sip(object_11, object_0, object_8)
- Step 6 — t=5 to t=6: sip(object_10, object_0, object_8)
- Step 7 — t=6 to t=7: memory(object_0, object_8, object_6)
- Step 8 — t=7 to t=8: paltry(object_11, object_0, object_6)
- Step 9 — t=8 to t=9: clip(object_11, object_4, object_6)
- Step 10 — t=9 to t=10: paltry(object_10, object_0, object_6)
- Step 11 — t=10 to t=11: clip(object_10, object_4, object_6)
- Step 12 — t=11 to t=12: wretched(object_4, object_6, object_7, object_2)
- Step 13 — t=12 to t=13: tightfisted(object_12, object_4, object_7)
- Step 14 — t=13 to t=14: tightfisted(object_11, object_4, object_7)
- Step 15 — t=14 to t=15: tightfisted(object_10, object_4, object_7)

Result: Achieves the goal facts next(object_10, object_7), next(object_11, object_7), and next(object_12, object_7).
