Here is the human-readable sequence of actions following the provided plan. Each action has unit duration (1) and starts at the indicated timestamp.

1) t=0, dur=1: clip(hand=object_9, sneeze=object_4, texture=object_8)
2) t=1, dur=1: clip(hand=object_11, sneeze=object_4, texture=object_8)
3) t=2, dur=1: sip(hand=object_12, cats=object_0, texture=object_5)
4) t=3, dur=1: wretched(sneeze=object_4, from_texture=object_8, to_texture=object_7, stupendous=object_2)
5) t=4, dur=1: tightfisted(hand=object_9, sneeze=object_4, texture=object_7)
6) t=5, dur=1: tightfisted(hand=object_11, sneeze=object_4, texture=object_7)
7) t=6, dur=1: clip(hand=object_10, sneeze=object_4, texture=object_7)
8) t=7, dur=1: wretched(sneeze=object_3, from_texture=object_6, to_texture=object_5, stupendous=object_1)
9) t=8, dur=1: memory(cats=object_0, from_spring=object_5, to_spring=object_7)
10) t=9, dur=1: sip(hand=object_9, cats=object_0, texture=object_7)
11) t=10, dur=1: paltry(hand=object_12, cats=object_0, texture=object_7)
12) t=11, dur=1: clip(hand=object_12, sneeze=object_4, texture=object_7)
13) t=12, dur=1: wretched(sneeze=object_4, from_texture=object_7, to_texture=object_8, stupendous=object_2)
14) t=13, dur=1: tightfisted(hand=object_12, sneeze=object_4, texture=object_8)
15) t=14, dur=1: tightfisted(hand=object_10, sneeze=object_4, texture=object_8)
16) t=15, dur=1: sip(hand=object_11, cats=object_0, texture=object_7)
17) t=16, dur=1: memory(cats=object_0, from_spring=object_7, to_spring=object_5)
18) t=17, dur=1: paltry(hand=object_9, cats=object_0, texture=object_5)
19) t=18, dur=1: paltry(hand=object_11, cats=object_0, texture=object_5)
20) t=19, dur=1: clip(hand=object_11, sneeze=object_3, texture=object_5)
21) t=20, dur=1: wretched(sneeze=object_3, from_texture=object_5, to_texture=object_6, stupendous=object_1)
22) t=21, dur=1: tightfisted(hand=object_11, sneeze=object_3, texture=object_6)

End state achieves the goals:
- next(object_10, object_8)
- next(object_11, object_6)
- next(object_12, object_8)
- next(object_9, object_5)
