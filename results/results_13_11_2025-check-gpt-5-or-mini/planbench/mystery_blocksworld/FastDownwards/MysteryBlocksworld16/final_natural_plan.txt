Here is the human-readable action sequence following the provided plan exactly. Timestamps assume unit duration per action (1 time unit each).

- Step 1 [t=00–01]: Execute clip(object_12, object_5, object_9).
- Step 2 [t=01–02]: Execute clip(object_10, object_5, object_9).
- Step 3 [t=02–03]: Execute sip(object_13, object_1, object_6).
- Step 4 [t=03–04]: Execute wretched(object_4, object_7, object_6, object_2).
- Step 5 [t=04–05]: Execute wretched(object_5, object_9, object_8, object_3).
- Step 6 [t=05–06]: Execute tightfisted(object_12, object_5, object_8).
- Step 7 [t=06–07]: Execute clip(object_11, object_5, object_8).
- Step 8 [t=07–08]: Execute tightfisted(object_10, object_5, object_8).
- Step 9 [t=08–09]: Execute memory(object_1, object_6, object_8).
- Step 10 [t=09–10]: Execute paltry(object_13, object_1, object_8).
- Step 11 [t=10–11]: Execute clip(object_13, object_5, object_8).
- Step 12 [t=11–12]: Execute wretched(object_5, object_8, object_9, object_3).
- Step 13 [t=12–13]: Execute tightfisted(object_13, object_5, object_9).
- Step 14 [t=13–14]: Execute tightfisted(object_11, object_5, object_9).
- Step 15 [t=14–15]: Execute sip(object_12, object_1, object_8).
- Step 16 [t=15–16]: Execute sip(object_10, object_1, object_8).
- Step 17 [t=16–17]: Execute memory(object_1, object_8, object_6).
- Step 18 [t=17–18]: Execute paltry(object_12, object_1, object_6).
- Step 19 [t=18–19]: Execute clip(object_12, object_4, object_6).
- Step 20 [t=19–20]: Execute wretched(object_4, object_6, object_7, object_2).
- Step 21 [t=20–21]: Execute tightfisted(object_12, object_4, object_7).
- Step 22 [t=21–22]: Execute paltry(object_10, object_1, object_6).

Final goal achieved:
- next(object_10, object_6)
- next(object_11, object_9)
- next(object_12, object_7)
- next(object_13, object_9)
