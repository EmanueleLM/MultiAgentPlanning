Here is a clear, human-readable sequence of the actions in the given plan. Timestamps are start times; assume unit duration (dur=1) for each step.

- t=0 (dur=1): clip(object_11, object_5, object_9)
  - Effect: add vase(object_11, object_5); delete next(object_11, object_9)

- t=1 (dur=1): wretched(object_5, object_9, object_8, object_3)
  - Effect: add next(object_5, object_8); delete next(object_5, object_9)

- t=2 (dur=1): tightfisted(object_11, object_5, object_8)
  - Effect: add next(object_11, object_8); delete vase(object_11, object_5)

- t=3 (dur=1): clip(object_10, object_4, object_7)
  - Effect: add vase(object_10, object_4); delete next(object_10, object_7)

- t=4 (dur=1): sip(object_12, object_1, object_8)
  - Effect: add vase(object_12, object_1); delete next(object_12, object_8)

- t=5 (dur=1): memory(object_1, object_8, object_6)
  - Effect: add next(object_1, object_6); delete next(object_1, object_8)

- t=6 (dur=1): wretched(object_4, object_7, object_6, object_2)
  - Effect: add next(object_4, object_6); delete next(object_4, object_7)

- t=7 (dur=1): tightfisted(object_10, object_4, object_6)
  - Effect: add next(object_10, object_6); delete vase(object_10, object_4)

- t=8 (dur=1): paltry(object_12, object_1, object_6)
  - Effect: add next(object_12, object_6); delete vase(object_12, object_1)

- t=9 (dur=1): clip(object_12, object_4, object_6)
  - Effect: add vase(object_12, object_4); delete next(object_12, object_6)

- t=10 (dur=1): wretched(object_4, object_6, object_7, object_2)
  - Effect: add next(object_4, object_7); delete next(object_4, object_6)

- t=11 (dur=1): tightfisted(object_12, object_4, object_7)
  - Effect: add next(object_12, object_7); delete vase(object_12, object_4)

Final state achieved (matches the goal):
- next(object_10, object_6)
- next(object_11, object_8)
- next(object_12, object_7)
- next(object_13, object_9) (unchanged from initial state)
