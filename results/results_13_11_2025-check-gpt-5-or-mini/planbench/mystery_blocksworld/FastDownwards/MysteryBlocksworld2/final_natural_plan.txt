Here is the human-readable execution of the provided plan (unit-duration steps with timestamps):

1) t=0 to 1 — memory(object_0, object_6, object_5)
- Preconditions: cats(object_0), spring(object_6), spring(object_5), next(object_0, object_6)
- Effect: redirect object_0’s link from object_6 to object_5
  - Add next(object_0, object_5)
  - Delete next(object_0, object_6)

2) t=1 to 2 — sip(object_8, object_0, object_5)
- Preconditions: hand(object_8), cats(object_0), texture(object_5), next(object_8, object_5), next(object_0, object_5)
- Effect: pair object_8 with object_0 via a vase and clear object_8’s link to object_5
  - Add vase(object_8, object_0)
  - Delete next(object_8, object_5)

3) t=2 to 3 — memory(object_0, object_5, object_6)
- Preconditions: cats(object_0), spring(object_5), spring(object_6), next(object_0, object_5)
- Effect: restore object_0’s link from object_5 back to object_6
  - Add next(object_0, object_6)
  - Delete next(object_0, object_5)

4) t=3 to 4 — paltry(object_8, object_0, object_6)
- Preconditions: hand(object_8), cats(object_0), texture(object_6), vase(object_8, object_0), next(object_0, object_6)
- Effect: create link from object_8 to object_6 and remove the vase link
  - Add next(object_8, object_6)
  - Delete vase(object_8, object_0)

Goal achieved at t=4:
- next(object_7, object_6) holds (unchanged throughout)
- next(object_8, object_6) achieved in step 4
