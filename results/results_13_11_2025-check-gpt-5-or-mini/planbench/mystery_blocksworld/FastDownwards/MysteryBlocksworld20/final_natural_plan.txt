Here is the human-readable sequence of actions that follows the given plan exactly and achieves the goal next object_12 object_11. Each action is assumed to take 1 time unit.

Step 1 (T=0 -> T=1): (wretched object_5 object_9 object_10 object_3)
- Effect: Re-route object_5’s next-link from object_9 to object_10 (adds next object_5 object_10; removes next object_5 object_9).

Step 2 (T=1 -> T=2): (clip object_12 object_5 object_10)
- Effect: Create a vase link between object_12 and object_5 and clear object_12’s next to object_10 (adds vase object_12 object_5; removes next object_12 object_10).

Step 3 (T=2 -> T=3): (wretched object_5 object_10 object_11 object_3)
- Effect: Re-route object_5’s next-link from object_10 to object_11 (adds next object_5 object_11; removes next object_5 object_10).

Step 4 (T=3 -> T=4): (tightfisted object_12 object_5 object_11)
- Effect: Use the vase link and object_5 at object_11 to set object_12’s next to object_11 and remove the vase link (adds next object_12 object_11; removes vase object_12 object_5).

Goal achieved: next object_12 object_11.
