FINAL-PLAN
------------------------------
I’m missing the concrete action_model, scenario_2, and audit_report content needed to build a faithful and solver-compatible PDDL. Please provide or confirm the following so I can emit the final domain and problem you requested:

1) Action model (exact tokens, lowercase)
- Full predicate vocabulary (names, argument lists, and any typing).
- All six actions paltry, sip, clip, wretched, memory, tightfisted with:
  - Parameters (with types if any).
  - Preconditions (no negative preconditions unless explicitly intended).
  - Effects (add/delete lists; if action costs are required, specify numeric fluents and increases).

2) scenario_2 (initial state and goal)
- Complete set of initial facts over objects object_0 … object_8 (and any additional typed objects, if applicable).
- Complete goal conditions. If there is an implied order or phased timeline, enumerate the phases/slots and their successor relation so I can enforce contiguity and ordering as hard constraints.

3) audit_report constraints
- Any hard constraints, preferences to be treated as hard (avoid/would rather/earliest/exactly/at most), mutual exclusions, capacities, or forbidden states that must be encoded directly (not via penalties or quota tokens).

4) Typing and objects
- Confirm whether all objects are of a single type (e.g., object), or provide the type hierarchy for object_0 … object_8 and any other constants required by the action model.

5) Costs (optional)
- If you require action costs, specify the metric and per-action cost so I can add matching (increase ...) effects and a :metric minimize total-cost in the problem; otherwise I will omit costs.

Once I have these specifics, I will return:
- <domain> … </domain> with name mystery-blocks, using only :strips, :typing, and (if you confirm) :negative-preconditions (and :action-costs only if needed).
- <problem> … </problem> named scenario-2 with objects object_0 … object_8, a fully enumerated initial state from scenario_2, and a goal that fixes every mandated terminal condition and enforces required ordering.

NATURAL-PLAN sas_plan_1
------------------------------
Here is the human-readable sequence that follows the plan exactly and achieves the goal next object_8 object_6:

1) Time 0.0–1.0 (duration 1): Execute sip(object_8, object_1, object_7)
   - Preconditions used: hand object_8, cats object_1, texture object_7, next object_8 object_7, next object_1 object_7
   - Effects: adds vase object_8 object_1; removes next object_8 object_7

2) Time 1.0–2.0 (duration 1): Execute memory(object_1, object_7, object_6)
   - Preconditions used: cats object_1, spring object_7, spring object_6, next object_1 object_7
   - Effects: adds next object_1 object_6; removes next object_1 object_7

3) Time 2.0–3.0 (duration 1): Execute paltry(object_8, object_1, object_6)
   - Preconditions used: hand object_8, cats object_1, texture object_6, vase object_8 object_1, next object_1 object_6
   - Effects: adds next object_8 object_6; removes vase object_8 object_1

Goal achieved: next object_8 object_6.

NATURAL-PLAN sas_plan_1
------------------------------
Here is the human-readable execution of the provided plan. All actions are instantaneous; we annotate each with a timestamp (t) and duration 1 time unit.

1) t=0, duration=1: memory(object_0, object_6, object_5)
- Effect: replace next(object_0, object_6) with next(object_0, object_5).

2) t=1, duration=1: sip(object_8, object_0, object_5)
- Effect: add vase(object_8, object_0); delete next(object_8, object_5).

3) t=2, duration=1: memory(object_0, object_5, object_6)
- Effect: replace next(object_0, object_5) with next(object_0, object_6).

4) t=3, duration=1: paltry(object_8, object_0, object_6)
- Effect: add next(object_8, object_6); delete vase(object_8, object_0).

Outcome: Goal achieved. next(object_7, object_6) was already true initially and remains true; next(object_8, object_6) becomes true at t=3.

NATURAL-PLAN sas_plan_10
------------------------------
Here is the human-readable execution of the provided plan (unit-duration steps with timestamps):

1) t=0 to 1 — memory(object_0, object_6, object_5)
- Preconditions: cats(object_0), spring(object_6), spring(object_5), next(object_0, object_6)
- Effect: redirect object_0’s link from object_6 to object_5
  - Add next(object_0, object_5)
  - Delete next(object_0, object_6)

2) t=1 to 2 — sip(object_8, object_0, object_5)
- Preconditions: hand(object_8), cats(object_0), texture(object_5), next(object_8, object_5), next(object_0, object_5)
- Effect: pair object_8 with object_0 via a vase and clear object_8’s link to object_5
  - Add vase(object_8, object_0)
  - Delete next(object_8, object_5)

3) t=2 to 3 — memory(object_0, object_5, object_6)
- Preconditions: cats(object_0), spring(object_5), spring(object_6), next(object_0, object_5)
- Effect: restore object_0’s link from object_5 back to object_6
  - Add next(object_0, object_6)
  - Delete next(object_0, object_5)

4) t=3 to 4 — paltry(object_8, object_0, object_6)
- Preconditions: hand(object_8), cats(object_0), texture(object_6), vase(object_8, object_0), next(object_0, object_6)
- Effect: create link from object_8 to object_6 and remove the vase link
  - Add next(object_8, object_6)
  - Delete vase(object_8, object_0)

Goal achieved at t=4:
- next(object_7, object_6) holds (unchanged throughout)
- next(object_8, object_6) achieved in step 4

NATURAL-PLAN sas_plan_5
------------------------------
Here is the human-readable execution of the given plan, with timestamps (unit duration = 1 time unit):

- t=0 → t=1: sip(object_8, object_0, object_6)
  - Preconditions used: hand(object_8), cats(object_0), texture(object_6), next(object_8, object_6), next(object_0, object_6)
  - Effects: add vase(object_8, object_0); delete next(object_8, object_6)

- t=1 → t=2: sip(object_7, object_0, object_6)
  - Preconditions used: hand(object_7), cats(object_0), texture(object_6), next(object_7, object_6), next(object_0, object_6)
  - Effects: add vase(object_7, object_0); delete next(object_7, object_6)

- t=2 → t=3: memory(object_0, object_6, object_5)
  - Preconditions used: cats(object_0), spring(object_6), spring(object_5), next(object_0, object_6)
  - Effects: add next(object_0, object_5); delete next(object_0, object_6)

- t=3 → t=4: paltry(object_8, object_0, object_5)
  - Preconditions used: hand(object_8), cats(object_0), texture(object_5), vase(object_8, object_0), next(object_0, object_5)
  - Effects: add next(object_8, object_5); delete vase(object_8, object_0)

- t=4 → t=5: paltry(object_7, object_0, object_5)
  - Preconditions used: hand(object_7), cats(object_0), texture(object_5), vase(object_7, object_0), next(object_0, object_5)
  - Effects: add next(object_7, object_5); delete vase(object_7, object_0)

Final outcome: goals satisfied — next(object_8, object_5) and next(object_7, object_5).

Here is the human-readable execution of the plan (unit-duration steps):

- t=0 to t=1 (duration 1): Execute clip(object_9, object_4, object_7).
  Preconditions met: hand(object_9), sneeze(object_4), texture(object_7), next(object_4, object_7), next(object_9, object_7).
  Effects: add vase(object_9, object_4); remove next(object_9, object_7).

- t=1 to t=2 (duration 1): Execute wretched(object_4, object_7, object_8, object_2).
  Preconditions met: sneeze(object_4), texture(object_7), texture(object_8), stupendous(object_2), next(object_4, object_7), collect(object_7, object_2), collect(object_8, object_2).
  Effects: add next(object_4, object_8); remove next(object_4, object_7).

- t=2 to t=3 (duration 1): Execute tightfisted(object_9, object_4, object_8).
  Preconditions met: hand(object_9), sneeze(object_4), texture(object_8), next(object_4, object_8), vase(object_9, object_4).
  Effects: add next(object_9, object_8); remove vase(object_9, object_4).

NATURAL-PLAN sas_plan_1
------------------------------
Here is the human-readable sequence of actions that follows the given plan exactly and achieves the goal (next object_10 object_6). Each step is assumed to take duration 1 time unit.

1) t=0 → 1 (duration 1): clip object_10 object_5 object_9
   - Use the hand-held object_10 with sneezy object_5 at textured object_9 to form vase(object_10, object_5) and remove next(object_10, object_9).

2) t=1 → 2 (duration 1): wretched object_5 object_9 object_8 object_3
   - Shift object_5’s linkage from object_9 to object_8 (given textures on 9 and 8, stupendous object_3, and required collects), replacing next(object_5, object_9) with next(object_5, object_8).

3) t=2 → 3 (duration 1): tightfisted object_10 object_5 object_8
   - With vase(object_10, object_5) and next(object_5, object_8), move object_10’s linkage to object_8 and remove the vase: add next(object_10, object_8), delete vase(object_10, object_5).

4) t=3 → 4 (duration 1): sip object_10 object_0 object_8
   - Using cats(object_0) and texture(object_8) with next(object_10, object_8) and next(object_0, object_8), create vase(object_10, object_0) and remove next(object_10, object_8).

5) t=4 → 5 (duration 1): memory object_0 object_8 object_6
   - With springs at object_8 and object_6 and next(object_0, object_8), shift object_0’s linkage to object_6: add next(object_0, object_6), delete next(object_0, object_8).

6) t=5 → 6 (duration 1): paltry object_10 object_0 object_6
   - With vase(object_10, object_0), cats(object_0), texture(object_6), and next(object_0, object_6), move object_10’s linkage to object_6 and remove the vase: add next(object_10, object_6), delete vase(object_10, object_0).

Result: Goal achieved — next object_10 object_6 is true at t=6.

PROBLEM
------------------------------
I am playing with a set of objects. Here are the actions I can do

Paltry object_0 object_1 object_2.
Sip object_0 object_1 object_2.
Clip object_0 object_1 object_2.
Wretched object_0 object_1 object_2 object_3.
Memory object_0 object_1 object_2.
Tightfisted object_0 object_1 object_2.

I have the following restrictions on my actions:
To perform paltry action, the following facts need to be true: hand object_0, cats object_1, texture object_2, vase object_0 object_1, and next object_1 object_2
Once paltry is performed the following facts will be true: next object_0 object_2
Once paltry is performed the following facts will be false: vase object_0 object_1
To perform sip action, the following facts need to be true: hand object_0, cats object_1, texture object_2, next object_0 object_2, and next object_1 object_2
Once sip is performed the following facts will be true: vase object_0 object_1
Once sip is performed the following facts will be false: next object_0 object_2
To perform clip action, the following facts need to be true: hand object_0, sneeze object_1, texture object_2, next object_1 object_2, and next object_0 object_2
Once clip is performed the following facts will be true: vase object_0 object_1
Once clip is performed the following facts will be false: next object_0 object_2

Here is the human-readable sequence of actions that follows the given plan exactly and reaches the goal next object_10 object_6:

1) t0 → t1: clip object_10 object_5 object_9
   - Effect: creates vase(object_10, object_5) and removes next(object_10, object_9).

2) t1 → t2: wretched object_5 object_9 object_8 object_3
   - Effect: changes next(object_5, ·) from object_9 to object_8.

3) t2 → t3: tightfisted object_10 object_5 object_8
   - Effect: creates next(object_10, object_8) and removes vase(object_10, object_5).

4) t3 → t4: sip object_10 object_0 object_8
   - Effect: creates vase(object_10, object_0) and removes next(object_10, object_8).

5) t4 → t5: memory object_0 object_8 object_6
   - Effect: changes next(object_0, ·) from object_8 to object_6.

NATURAL-PLAN sas_plan_10
------------------------------
Here is the human-readable version of the plan, following the given sequence exactly.

- t=0 → t=1: clip object_9 object_4 object_8
  - Preconditions used: hand object_9; sneeze object_4; texture object_8; next object_4 object_8; next object_9 object_8.
  - Effects: add vase object_9 object_4; delete next object_9 object_8.

- t=1 → t=2: wretched object_4 object_8 object_7 object_2
  - Preconditions used: sneeze object_4; texture object_8; texture object_7; stupendous object_2; next object_4 object_8; collect object_8 object_2; collect object_7 object_2.
  - Effects: add next object_4 object_7; delete next object_4 object_8.

- t=2 → t=3: tightfisted object_9 object_4 object_7
  - Preconditions used: hand object_9; sneeze object_4; texture object_7; next object_4 object_7; vase object_9 object_4.
  - Effects: add next object_9 object_7; delete vase object_9 object_4.

Goal achieved at t=3:
- next object_10 object_5 remains true from the start.
- next object_9 object_7 becomes true after the final step.

NATURAL-PLAN sas_plan_1
------------------------------
Here is the human-readable action sequence that follows the plan exactly and reaches the goal. Each step assumes unit duration and sequential execution.

- Time 0–1 (duration 1): Execute WRETCHED on o0=object_5, o1=object_8, o2=object_9, o3=object_3
  - Effect: Re-route next(object_5, •) from object_8 to object_9.

- Time 1–2 (duration 1): Execute CLIP on o0=object_11, o1=object_5, o2=object_9
  - Effect: Establish vase(object_11, object_5) and remove next(object_11, object_9).

- Time 2–3 (duration 1): Execute WRETCHED on o0=object_5, o1=object_9, o2=object_8, o3=object_3
  - Effect: Re-route next(object_5, •) from object_9 back to object_8.

- Time 3–4 (duration 1): Execute TIGHTFISTED on o0=object_11, o1=object_5, o2=object_8
  - Effect: Set next(object_11, object_8) and clear vase(object_11, object_5).

- Time 4–5 (duration 1): Execute CLIP on o0=object_10, o1=object_4, o2=object_6
  - Effect: Establish vase(object_10, object_4) and remove next(object_10, object_6).

- Time 5–6 (duration 1): Execute WRETCHED on o0=object_4, o1=object_6, o2=object_7, o3=object_2
  - Effect: Re-route next(object_4, •) from object_6 to object_7.

- Time 6–7 (duration 1): Execute TIGHTFISTED on o0=object_10, o1=object_4, o2=object_7
  - Effect: Set next(object_10, object_7) and clear vase(object_10, object_4).

Outcome: Goal achieved with next(object_11, object_8) and next(object_10, object_7).

NATURAL-PLAN sas_plan_1
------------------------------
Here is the human-readable sequence that follows the given plan exactly. Each step includes a timestamp (unit duration = 1):

1. t=0–1: wretched object_4 object_7 object_8 object_2 — Shift next for object_4 from object_7 to object_8.
2. t=1–2: clip object_10 object_4 object_8 — Bind object_10 to object_4 (vase), removing next(object_10, object_8).
3. t=2–3: wretched object_4 object_8 object_7 object_2 — Shift next for object_4 back from object_8 to object_7.
4. t=3–4: tightfisted object_10 object_4 object_7 — Use the vase link to set next(object_10, object_7) and clear the vase.
5. t=4–5: wretched object_3 object_5 object_6 object_1 — Shift next for object_3 from object_5 to object_6.
6. t=5–6: clip object_11 object_3 object_6 — Bind object_11 to object_3 (vase), removing next(object_11, object_6).
7. t=6–7: wretched object_3 object_6 object_5 object_1 — Shift next for object_3 back from object_6 to object_5.
8. t=7–8: tightfisted object_11 object_3 object_5 — Use the vase link to set next(object_11, object_5) and clear the vase.
9. t=8–9: sip object_9 object_0 object_5 — Create vase(object_9, object_0), removing next(object_9, object_5).
10. t=9–10: sip object_11 object_0 object_5 — Create vase(object_11, object_0), removing next(object_11, object_5).
11. t=10–11: memory object_0 object_5 object_7 — Move next(object_0, …) from object_5 to object_7.
12. t=11–12: paltry object_9 object_0 object_7 — Use vase(object_9, object_0) and next(object_0, object_7) to set next(object_9, object_7); remove the vase.
13. t=12–13: paltry object_11 object_0 object_7 — Use vase(object_11, object_0) and next(object_0, object_7) to set next(object_11, object_7); remove the vase.

Goal achieved: next(object_10, object_7), next(object_11, object_7), and next(object_9, object_7).

PROBLEM
------------------------------
I am playing with a set of objects. Here are the actions I can do

Paltry object_0 object_1 object_2.
Sip object_0 object_1 object_2.
Clip object_0 object_1 object_2.
Wretched object_0 object_1 object_2 object_3.
Memory object_0 object_1 object_2.
Tightfisted object_0 object_1 object_2.

I have the following restrictions on my actions:
To perform paltry action, the following facts need to be true: hand object_0, cats object_1, texture object_2, vase object_0 object_1, and next object_1 object_2
Once paltry is performed the following facts will be true: next object_0 object_2
Once paltry is performed the following facts will be false: vase object_0 object_1
To perform sip action, the following facts need to be true: hand object_0, cats object_1, texture object_2, next object_0 object_2, and next object_1 object_2
Once sip is performed the following facts will be true: vase object_0 object_1
Once sip is performed the following facts will be false: next object_0 object_2
To perform clip action, the following facts need to be true: hand object_0, sneeze object_1, texture object_2, next object_1 object_2, and next object_0 object_2
Once clip is performed the following facts will be true: vase object_0 object_1
Once clip is performed the following facts will be false: next object_0 object_2
To perform wretched action, the following facts need to be true: sneeze object_0, texture object_1, texture object_2, stupendous object_3, next object_0 object_1, collect object_1 object_3, and collect object_2 object_3

Here is the human-readable sequence of actions that follows the provided plan exactly and includes stage timestamps:

- Step 1 (t00→t01): sip(object_11, object_0, object_6). Adds vase(object_11, object_0); deletes next(object_11, object_6).
- Step 2 (t01→t02): memory(object_0, object_6, object_8). Adds next(object_0, object_8); deletes next(object_0, object_6).
- Step 3 (t02→t03): paltry(object_11, object_0, object_8). Adds next(object_11, object_8); deletes vase(object_11, object_0).
- Step 4 (t03→t04): clip(object_11, object_5, object_8). Adds vase(object_11, object_5); deletes next(object_11, object_8).
- Step 5 (t04→t05): wretched(object_5, object_8, object_9, object_3). Adds next(object_5, object_9); deletes next(object_5, object_8).
- Step 6 (t05→t06): clip(object_10, object_5, object_9). Adds vase(object_10, object_5); deletes next(object_10, object_9).
- Step 7 (t06→t07): tightfisted(object_11, object_5, object_9). Adds next(object_11, object_9); deletes vase(object_11, object_5).
- Step 8 (t07→t08): wretched(object_4, object_7, object_6, object_2). Adds next(object_4, object_6); deletes next(object_4, object_7).
- Step 9 (t08→t09): wretched(object_5, object_9, object_8, object_3). Adds next(object_5, object_8); deletes next(object_5, object_9).
- Step 10 (t09→t10): tightfisted(object_10, object_5, object_8). Adds next(object_10, object_8); deletes vase(object_10, object_5).
- Step 11 (t10→t11): sip(object_10, object_0, object_8). Adds vase(object_10, object_0); deletes next(object_10, object_8).
- Step 12 (t11→t12): memory(object_0, object_8, object_6). Adds next(object_0, object_6); deletes next(object_0, object_8).
- Step 13 (t12→t13): paltry(object_10, object_0, object_6). Adds next(object_10, object_6); deletes vase(object_10, object_0).
- Step 14 (t13→t14): sip(object_12, object_0, object_6). Adds vase(object_12, object_0); deletes next(object_12, object_6).
- Step 15 (t14→t15): memory(object_0, object_6, object_8). Adds next(object_0, object_8); deletes next(object_0, object_6).
- Step 16 (t15→t16): paltry(object_12, object_0, object_8). Adds next(object_12, object_8); deletes vase(object_12, object_0).
- Step 17 (t16→t17): clip(object_10, object_4, object_6). Adds vase(object_10, object_4); deletes next(object_10, object_6).
- Step 18 (t17→t18): wretched(object_4, object_6, object_7, object_2). Adds next(object_4, object_7); deletes next(object_4, object_6).
- Step 19 (t18→t19): tightfisted(object_10, object_4, object_7). Adds next(object_10, object_7); deletes vase(object_10, object_4).

Final goals achieved after Step 19:
- next(object_10, object_7)
- next(object_11, object_9)
- next(object_12, object_8)

NATURAL-PLAN sas_plan_10
------------------------------
Here is the human-readable sequence of actions that follows the provided plan exactly. Each step is sequential with unit duration.

- Step 1 — t=0 to t=1: clip(object_11, object_5, object_9)
- Step 2 — t=1 to t=2: wretched(object_5, object_9, object_8, object_3)
- Step 3 — t=2 to t=3: tightfisted(object_11, object_5, object_8)
- Step 4 — t=3 to t=4: clip(object_12, object_4, object_6)
- Step 5 — t=4 to t=5: sip(object_11, object_0, object_8)
- Step 6 — t=5 to t=6: sip(object_10, object_0, object_8)
- Step 7 — t=6 to t=7: memory(object_0, object_8, object_6)
- Step 8 — t=7 to t=8: paltry(object_11, object_0, object_6)
- Step 9 — t=8 to t=9: clip(object_11, object_4, object_6)
- Step 10 — t=9 to t=10: paltry(object_10, object_0, object_6)
- Step 11 — t=10 to t=11: clip(object_10, object_4, object_6)
- Step 12 — t=11 to t=12: wretched(object_4, object_6, object_7, object_2)
- Step 13 — t=12 to t=13: tightfisted(object_12, object_4, object_7)
- Step 14 — t=13 to t=14: tightfisted(object_11, object_4, object_7)
- Step 15 — t=14 to t=15: tightfisted(object_10, object_4, object_7)

Result: Achieves the goal facts next(object_10, object_7), next(object_11, object_7), and next(object_12, object_7).

FINAL-PLAN
------------------------------
I’m missing the normalized_schemas and the selected_instance. Please paste:
- The normalized_schemas (with action names, parameter lists, preconditions, and effects for paltry, sip, clip, wretched, memory, tightfisted)
- The selected_instance (objects, any types if applicable, initial facts, goals, and any ordering/phase/time-slot data)

With those, I will produce exactly one PDDL domain and one PDDL problem using only the predicates cats, hand, sneeze, spring, stupendous, texture, collect, vase, next, and the six specified actions, matching the schemas and instance precisely.

NATURAL-PLAN sas_plan_1
------------------------------
Here is a clear, human-readable sequence of the actions in the given plan. Timestamps are start times; assume unit duration (dur=1) for each step.

- t=0 (dur=1): clip(object_11, object_5, object_9)
  - Effect: add vase(object_11, object_5); delete next(object_11, object_9)

- t=1 (dur=1): wretched(object_5, object_9, object_8, object_3)
  - Effect: add next(object_5, object_8); delete next(object_5, object_9)

- t=2 (dur=1): tightfisted(object_11, object_5, object_8)
  - Effect: add next(object_11, object_8); delete vase(object_11, object_5)

- t=3 (dur=1): clip(object_10, object_4, object_7)
  - Effect: add vase(object_10, object_4); delete next(object_10, object_7)

- t=4 (dur=1): sip(object_12, object_1, object_8)
  - Effect: add vase(object_12, object_1); delete next(object_12, object_8)

- t=5 (dur=1): memory(object_1, object_8, object_6)
  - Effect: add next(object_1, object_6); delete next(object_1, object_8)

- t=6 (dur=1): wretched(object_4, object_7, object_6, object_2)
  - Effect: add next(object_4, object_6); delete next(object_4, object_7)

- t=7 (dur=1): tightfisted(object_10, object_4, object_6)
  - Effect: add next(object_10, object_6); delete vase(object_10, object_4)

- t=8 (dur=1): paltry(object_12, object_1, object_6)
  - Effect: add next(object_12, object_6); delete vase(object_12, object_1)

- t=9 (dur=1): clip(object_12, object_4, object_6)
  - Effect: add vase(object_12, object_4); delete next(object_12, object_6)

- t=10 (dur=1): wretched(object_4, object_6, object_7, object_2)
  - Effect: add next(object_4, object_7); delete next(object_4, object_6)

- t=11 (dur=1): tightfisted(object_12, object_4, object_7)
  - Effect: add next(object_12, object_7); delete vase(object_12, object_4)

Final state achieved (matches the goal):
- next(object_10, object_6)
- next(object_11, object_8)
- next(object_12, object_7)
- next(object_13, object_9) (unchanged from initial state)

FINAL-PLAN
------------------------------
I’m missing the necessary source artifacts to generate the final PDDL. Please provide or paste:
- lifted_model (with the six actions paltry, sip, clip, wretched, memory, tightfisted and their exact preconditions/effects)
- grounded_problems for Scenario B (including environment.init.objects)
- consistency_report (to apply any required adjustments)
- Scenario B initial facts

Once you share those, I will integrate them and return the domain and problem enclosed in the requested tags.

NATURAL-PLAN sas_plan_1
------------------------------
Here is the human-readable sequence of actions that follows the given plan exactly and achieves the goal next object_12 object_11. Each action is assumed to take 1 time unit.

Step 1 (T=0 -> T=1): (wretched object_5 object_9 object_10 object_3)
- Effect: Re-route object_5’s next-link from object_9 to object_10 (adds next object_5 object_10; removes next object_5 object_9).

Step 2 (T=1 -> T=2): (clip object_12 object_5 object_10)
- Effect: Create a vase link between object_12 and object_5 and clear object_12’s next to object_10 (adds vase object_12 object_5; removes next object_12 object_10).

Step 3 (T=2 -> T=3): (wretched object_5 object_10 object_11 object_3)
- Effect: Re-route object_5’s next-link from object_10 to object_11 (adds next object_5 object_11; removes next object_5 object_10).

Step 4 (T=3 -> T=4): (tightfisted object_12 object_5 object_11)
- Effect: Use the vase link and object_5 at object_11 to set object_12’s next to object_11 and remove the vase link (adds next object_12 object_11; removes vase object_12 object_5).

Goal achieved: next object_12 object_11.

FINAL-PLAN
------------------------------
I’m missing the necessary specifications to produce correct and solver-compatible PDDL. Please provide the concrete details from the domain_spec, instances_spec, and audit_report for Scenario 2, so I can encode them exactly without inventing anything. Specifically:

- Predicate vocabulary: full list of predicate names (with arity and, if applicable, types) that the six actions use and that appear in the initial state and goals.
- Objects (and types, if any) for Scenario 2.
- Exact action schemas for paltry, sip, clip, wretched, memory, tightfisted: parameters, preconditions, and effects verbatim from the public specification.
- Scenario 2 initial state: complete set of true facts (and any required negative facts if the spec relies on them).
- Scenario 2 goals: full set of required terminal facts. If there are ordered phases/slots or “earliest/exactly/at most” constraints, include the discrete phase/slot set and the required ordering/contiguity constraints so I can encode them as hard constraints using only the given predicates.
- Any additional hard constraints derived from preferences in the audit_report that must be enforced (no penalty/shortfall mechanisms).
- Whether action costs are required; if so, the exact metric and per-action cost contributions, otherwise I will omit :action-costs.

Once I have those, I will emit a single PDDL domain and a single PDDL problem enclosed in the requested tags, using only :strips, :typing, and :negative-preconditions (and :action-costs only if explicitly needed), with no helper predicates or placeholder content, and with explicit ordering constraints encoded using the provided predicates.

NATURAL-PLAN sas_plan_1
------------------------------
Here is the human-readable sequence of actions following the given plan exactly. Each step shows a start timestamp (t) and duration (dur=1 time unit), plus the direct outcome of the action.

1) t=0, dur=1: wretched(object_4, object_8, object_10, object_2)
- Outcome: add next(object_4, object_10); delete next(object_4, object_8)

2) t=1, dur=1: clip(object_12, object_4, object_10)
- Outcome: add vase(object_12, object_4); delete next(object_12, object_10)

3) t=2, dur=1: wretched(object_4, object_10, object_8, object_2)
- Outcome: add next(object_4, object_8); delete next(object_4, object_10)

4) t=3, dur=1: wretched(object_4, object_8, object_9, object_2)
- Outcome: add next(object_4, object_9); delete next(object_4, object_8)

5) t=4, dur=1: clip(object_11, object_4, object_9)
- Outcome: add vase(object_11, object_4); delete next(object_11, object_9)

6) t=5, dur=1: wretched(object_4, object_9, object_8, object_2)
- Outcome: add next(object_4, object_8); delete next(object_4, object_9)

7) t=6, dur=1: tightfisted(object_12, object_4, object_8)
- Outcome: add next(object_12, object_8); delete vase(object_12, object_4)

8) t=7, dur=1: tightfisted(object_11, object_4, object_8)
- Outcome: add next(object_11, object_8); delete vase(object_11, object_4)

9) t=8, dur=1: wretched(object_3, object_6, object_5, object_1)
- Outcome: add next(object_3, object_5); delete next(object_3, object_6)

10) t=9, dur=1: memory(object_0, object_5, object_8)
- Outcome: add next(object_0, object_8); delete next(object_0, object_5)

11) t=10, dur=1: sip(object_12, object_0, object_8)
- Outcome: add vase(object_12, object_0); delete next(object_12, object_8)

12) t=11, dur=1: sip(object_11, object_0, object_8)
- Outcome: add vase(object_11, object_0); delete next(object_11, object_8)

13) t=12, dur=1: memory(object_0, object_8, object_5)
- Outcome: add next(object_0, object_5); delete next(object_0, object_8)

14) t=13, dur=1: paltry(object_12, object_0, object_5)
- Outcome: add next(object_12, object_5); delete vase(object_12, object_0)

15) t=14, dur=1: paltry(object_11, object_0, object_5)
- Outcome: add next(object_11, object_5); delete vase(object_11, object_0)

16) t=15, dur=1: clip(object_11, object_3, object_5)
- Outcome: add vase(object_11, object_3); delete next(object_11, object_5)

17) t=16, dur=1: wretched(object_3, object_5, object_7, object_1)
- Outcome: add next(object_3, object_7); delete next(object_3, object_5)

18) t=17, dur=1: tightfisted(object_11, object_3, object_7)
- Outcome: add next(object_11, object_7); delete vase(object_11, object_3)

Final achieved goals:
- next(object_11, object_7)
- next(object_12, object_5)

Total steps: 18 (total time = 18 time units under unit-duration assumption).
