Here is the human-readable sequence of actions following the given plan exactly. Each step shows a start timestamp (t) and duration (dur=1 time unit), plus the direct outcome of the action.

1) t=0, dur=1: wretched(object_4, object_8, object_10, object_2)
- Outcome: add next(object_4, object_10); delete next(object_4, object_8)

2) t=1, dur=1: clip(object_12, object_4, object_10)
- Outcome: add vase(object_12, object_4); delete next(object_12, object_10)

3) t=2, dur=1: wretched(object_4, object_10, object_8, object_2)
- Outcome: add next(object_4, object_8); delete next(object_4, object_10)

4) t=3, dur=1: wretched(object_4, object_8, object_9, object_2)
- Outcome: add next(object_4, object_9); delete next(object_4, object_8)

5) t=4, dur=1: clip(object_11, object_4, object_9)
- Outcome: add vase(object_11, object_4); delete next(object_11, object_9)

6) t=5, dur=1: wretched(object_4, object_9, object_8, object_2)
- Outcome: add next(object_4, object_8); delete next(object_4, object_9)

7) t=6, dur=1: tightfisted(object_12, object_4, object_8)
- Outcome: add next(object_12, object_8); delete vase(object_12, object_4)

8) t=7, dur=1: tightfisted(object_11, object_4, object_8)
- Outcome: add next(object_11, object_8); delete vase(object_11, object_4)

9) t=8, dur=1: wretched(object_3, object_6, object_5, object_1)
- Outcome: add next(object_3, object_5); delete next(object_3, object_6)

10) t=9, dur=1: memory(object_0, object_5, object_8)
- Outcome: add next(object_0, object_8); delete next(object_0, object_5)

11) t=10, dur=1: sip(object_12, object_0, object_8)
- Outcome: add vase(object_12, object_0); delete next(object_12, object_8)

12) t=11, dur=1: sip(object_11, object_0, object_8)
- Outcome: add vase(object_11, object_0); delete next(object_11, object_8)

13) t=12, dur=1: memory(object_0, object_8, object_5)
- Outcome: add next(object_0, object_5); delete next(object_0, object_8)

14) t=13, dur=1: paltry(object_12, object_0, object_5)
- Outcome: add next(object_12, object_5); delete vase(object_12, object_0)

15) t=14, dur=1: paltry(object_11, object_0, object_5)
- Outcome: add next(object_11, object_5); delete vase(object_11, object_0)

16) t=15, dur=1: clip(object_11, object_3, object_5)
- Outcome: add vase(object_11, object_3); delete next(object_11, object_5)

17) t=16, dur=1: wretched(object_3, object_5, object_7, object_1)
- Outcome: add next(object_3, object_7); delete next(object_3, object_5)

18) t=17, dur=1: tightfisted(object_11, object_3, object_7)
- Outcome: add next(object_11, object_7); delete vase(object_11, object_3)

Final achieved goals:
- next(object_11, object_7)
- next(object_12, object_5)

Total steps: 18 (total time = 18 time units under unit-duration assumption).
