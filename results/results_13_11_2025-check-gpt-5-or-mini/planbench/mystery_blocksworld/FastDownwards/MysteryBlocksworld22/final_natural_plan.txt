Here is the human-readable sequence corresponding exactly to the provided plan. Each step takes 1 time unit.

- t=0→1: clip object_12 object_4 object_10
  Effect: +vase(object_12, object_4); −next(object_12, object_10)

- t=1→2: wretched object_4 object_10 object_8 object_2
  Effect: +next(object_4, object_8); −next(object_4, object_10)

- t=2→3: tightfisted object_12 object_4 object_8
  Effect: +next(object_12, object_8); −vase(object_12, object_4)

- t=3→4: wretched object_3 object_7 object_6 object_1
  Effect: +next(object_3, object_6); −next(object_3, object_7)

- t=4→5: clip object_11 object_3 object_6
  Effect: +vase(object_11, object_3); −next(object_11, object_6)

- t=5→6: wretched object_3 object_6 object_7 object_1
  Effect: +next(object_3, object_7); −next(object_3, object_6)

- t=6→7: tightfisted object_11 object_3 object_7
  Effect: +next(object_11, object_7); −vase(object_11, object_3)

Final state satisfies the goal: next(object_12, object_8) and next(object_11, object_7).
