Legend: + adds fact, − removes fact. Assume each action takes 1 time unit.

1) t=0–1: clip(object_12, object_5, object_11)
- Effects: +vase(object_12, object_5), −next(object_12, object_11)

2) t=1–2: wretched(object_5, object_11, object_10, object_3)
- Effects: +next(object_5, object_10), −next(object_5, object_11)

3) t=2–3: tightfisted(object_12, object_5, object_10)
- Effects: +next(object_12, object_10), −vase(object_12, object_5)

4) t=3–4: wretched(object_4, object_8, object_6, object_2)
- Effects: +next(object_4, object_6), −next(object_4, object_8)

5) t=4–5: wretched(object_4, object_6, object_7, object_2)
- Effects: +next(object_4, object_7), −next(object_4, object_6)

6) t=5–6: clip(object_13, object_4, object_7)
- Effects: +vase(object_13, object_4), −next(object_13, object_7)

7) t=6–7: wretched(object_4, object_7, object_6, object_2)
- Effects: +next(object_4, object_6), −next(object_4, object_7)

8) t=7–8: tightfisted(object_13, object_4, object_6)
- Effects: +next(object_13, object_6), −vase(object_13, object_4)

9) t=8–9: memory(object_0, object_9, object_6)
- Effects: +next(object_0, object_6), −next(object_0, object_9)

10) t=9–10: sip(object_13, object_0, object_6)
- Effects: +vase(object_13, object_0), −next(object_13, object_6)

11) t=10–11: memory(object_0, object_6, object_9)
- Effects: +next(object_0, object_9), −next(object_0, object_6)

12) t=11–12: paltry(object_13, object_0, object_9)
- Effects: +next(object_13, object_9), −vase(object_13, object_0)

Goal achieved at t=12: next(object_12, object_10) and next(object_13, object_9).
