Here is the human-readable execution sequence that follows the provided plan exactly. Each action lists its timestamp (unit duration = 1), the action with arguments, and its effects per the specification.

1) t=0→1: clip(object_12, object_5, object_11)
- Effects: add vase(object_12, object_5); delete next(object_12, object_11)

2) t=1→2: wretched(object_5, object_11, object_10, object_3)
- Effects: add next(object_5, object_10); delete next(object_5, object_11)

3) t=2→3: tightfisted(object_12, object_5, object_10)
- Effects: add next(object_12, object_10); delete vase(object_12, object_5)

4) t=3→4: wretched(object_4, object_8, object_6, object_2)
- Effects: add next(object_4, object_6); delete next(object_4, object_8)

5) t=4→5: wretched(object_4, object_6, object_7, object_2)
- Effects: add next(object_4, object_7); delete next(object_4, object_6)

6) t=5→6: clip(object_13, object_4, object_7)
- Effects: add vase(object_13, object_4); delete next(object_13, object_7)

7) t=6→7: wretched(object_4, object_7, object_6, object_2)
- Effects: add next(object_4, object_6); delete next(object_4, object_7)

8) t=7→8: tightfisted(object_13, object_4, object_6)
- Effects: add next(object_13, object_6); delete vase(object_13, object_4)

9) t=8→9: memory(object_0, object_9, object_6)
- Effects: add next(object_0, object_6); delete next(object_0, object_9)

10) t=9→10: sip(object_13, object_0, object_6)
- Effects: add vase(object_13, object_0); delete next(object_13, object_6)

11) t=10→11: memory(object_0, object_6, object_9)
- Effects: add next(object_0, object_9); delete next(object_0, object_6)

12) t=11→12: paltry(object_13, object_0, object_9)
- Effects: add next(object_13, object_9); delete vase(object_13, object_0)

Final goal achieved:
- next(object_12, object_10) is true (from step 3)
- next(object_13, object_9) is true (from step 12)
