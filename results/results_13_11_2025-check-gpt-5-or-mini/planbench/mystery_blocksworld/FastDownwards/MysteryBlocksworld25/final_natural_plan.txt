Here is a clear, human-readable rendition of the provided plan. Each step matches the plan exactly, with its stage timestamp and a brief effect summary.

1) Time s0→s1 (duration 1): Memory(object_0, object_8 → object_5)
- Effects: add next(object_0, object_5); delete next(object_0, object_8)

2) Time s1→s2 (duration 1): Wretched(object_3, object_6 → object_7, via object_1)
- Effects: add next(object_3, object_7); delete next(object_3, object_6)

11) Time s10→s11 (duration 1): Paltry(object_12, using object_0 toward object_8)
- Effects: add next(object_12, object_8); delete vase(object_12, object_0)

12) Time s11→s12 (duration 1): Paltry(object_13, using object_0 toward object_8)
- Effects: add next(object_13, object_8); delete vase(object_13, object_0)

13) Time s12→s13 (duration 1): Wretched(object_4, object_9 → object_10, via object_2)
- Effects: add next(object_4, object_10); delete next(object_4, object_9)

14) Time s13→s14 (duration 1): Wretched(object_4, object_10 → object_8, via object_2)
- Effects: add next(object_4, object_8); delete next(object_4, object_10)

15) Time s14→s15 (duration 1): Clip(object_12, with object_4 via object_8)
- Effects: add vase(object_12, object_4); delete next(object_12, object_8)

16) Time s15→s16 (duration 1): Clip(object_13, with object_4 via object_8)
- Effects: add vase(object_13, object_4); delete next(object_13, object_8)

17) Time s16→s17 (duration 1): Wretched(object_4, object_8 → object_10, via object_2)
- Effects: add next(object_4, object_10); delete next(object_4, object_8)

18) Time s17→s18 (duration 1): Clip(object_11, with object_4 via object_10)
- Effects: add vase(object_11, object_4); delete next(object_11, object_10)

19) Time s18→s19 (duration 1): Tightfisted(object_13, with object_4 toward object_10)
- Effects: add next(object_13, object_10); delete vase(object_13, object_4)

20) Time s19→s20 (duration 1): Wretched(object_4, object_10 → object_8, via object_2)
- Effects: add next(object_4, object_8); delete next(object_4, object_10)
