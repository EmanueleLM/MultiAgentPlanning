Here is a clear, human-readable sequence that follows the given plan exactly. Each action starts at the listed timestamp and takes duration 1 (unit time).

1. t=0–1, dur=1: wretched object_5 object_10 object_11 object_3
   result: add next object_5 object_11; remove next object_5 object_10

2. t=1–2, dur=1: clip object_12 object_5 object_11
   result: add vase object_12 object_5; remove next object_12 object_11

3. t=2–3, dur=1: wretched object_5 object_11 object_10 object_3
   result: add next object_5 object_10; remove next object_5 object_11

4. t=3–4, dur=1: tightfisted object_12 object_5 object_10
   result: add next object_12 object_10; remove vase object_12 object_5

5. t=4–5, dur=1: wretched object_5 object_10 object_9 object_3
   result: add next object_5 object_9; remove next object_5 object_10

6. t=5–6, dur=1: wretched object_4 object_7 object_8 object_2
   result: add next object_4 object_8; remove next object_4 object_7

7. t=6–7, dur=1: clip object_14 object_4 object_8
   result: add vase object_14 object_4; remove next object_14 object_8

8. t=7–8, dur=1: wretched object_4 object_8 object_6 object_2
   result: add next object_4 object_6; remove next object_4 object_8

9. t=8–9, dur=1: tightfisted object_14 object_4 object_6
   result: add next object_14 object_6; remove vase object_14 object_4

10. t=9–10, dur=1: sip object_14 object_0 object_6
    result: add vase object_14 object_0; remove next object_14 object_6

11. t=10–11, dur=1: sip object_13 object_0 object_6
    result: add vase object_13 object_0; remove next object_13 object_6

12. t=11–12, dur=1: memory object_0 object_6 object_9
    result: add next object_0 object_9; remove next object_0 object_6

13. t=12–13, dur=1: paltry object_14 object_0 object_9
    result: add next object_14 object_9; remove vase object_14 object_0

14. t=13–14, dur=1: paltry object_13 object_0 object_9
    result: add next object_13 object_9; remove vase object_13 object_0

15. t=14–15, dur=1: clip object_13 object_5 object_9
    result: add vase object_13 object_5; remove next object_13 object_9

16. t=15–16, dur=1: wretched object_5 object_9 object_10 object_3
    result: add next object_5 object_10; remove next object_5 object_9

17. t=16–17, dur=1: tightfisted object_13 object_5 object_10
    result: add next object_13 object_10; remove vase object_13 object_5

Final state achieves the goal:
- next object_12 object_10
- next object_13 object_10
- next object_14 object_9
