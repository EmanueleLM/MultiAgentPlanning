Here is the human-readable sequence of actions that follows the provided plan exactly. Each step has unit duration, so timestamps advance by 1.

1) t=0–1 (dur=1): wretched(object_4, object_9, object_10, object_2)
2) t=1–2 (dur=1): clip(object_11, object_4, object_10)
3) t=2–3 (dur=1): wretched(object_4, object_10, object_8, object_2)
4) t=3–4 (dur=1): wretched(object_3, object_6, object_5, object_1)
5) t=4–5 (dur=1): wretched(object_4, object_8, object_9, object_2)
6) t=5–6 (dur=1): clip(object_14, object_4, object_9)
7) t=6–7 (dur=1): tightfisted(object_11, object_4, object_9)
8) t=7–8 (dur=1): wretched(object_4, object_9, object_8, object_2)
9) t=8–9 (dur=1): tightfisted(object_14, object_4, object_8)
10) t=9–10 (dur=1): wretched(object_3, object_5, object_7, object_1)
11) t=10–11 (dur=1): clip(object_13, object_3, object_7)
12) t=11–12 (dur=1): sip(object_14, object_0, object_8)
13) t=12–13 (dur=1): wretched(object_3, object_7, object_5, object_1)
14) t=13–14 (dur=1): tightfisted(object_13, object_3, object_5)
15) t=14–15 (dur=1): memory(object_0, object_8, object_5)
16) t=15–16 (dur=1): paltry(object_14, object_0, object_5)
17) t=16–17 (dur=1): clip(object_14, object_3, object_5)
18) t=17–18 (dur=1): wretched(object_3, object_5, object_7, object_1)
19) t=18–19 (dur=1): tightfisted(object_14, object_3, object_7)
20) t=19–20 (dur=1): sip(object_12, object_0, object_5)
21) t=20–21 (dur=1): memory(object_0, object_5, object_8)
22) t=21–22 (dur=1): paltry(object_12, object_0, object_8)

Outcome: Achieves the goal facts next(object_11, object_9), next(object_12, object_8), next(object_13, object_5), and next(object_14, object_7).
