Here is the human-readable execution of the given plan, with timestamps (unit duration = 1 time unit):

- t=0 → t=1: sip(object_8, object_0, object_6)
  - Preconditions used: hand(object_8), cats(object_0), texture(object_6), next(object_8, object_6), next(object_0, object_6)
  - Effects: add vase(object_8, object_0); delete next(object_8, object_6)

- t=1 → t=2: sip(object_7, object_0, object_6)
  - Preconditions used: hand(object_7), cats(object_0), texture(object_6), next(object_7, object_6), next(object_0, object_6)
  - Effects: add vase(object_7, object_0); delete next(object_7, object_6)

- t=2 → t=3: memory(object_0, object_6, object_5)
  - Preconditions used: cats(object_0), spring(object_6), spring(object_5), next(object_0, object_6)
  - Effects: add next(object_0, object_5); delete next(object_0, object_6)

- t=3 → t=4: paltry(object_8, object_0, object_5)
  - Preconditions used: hand(object_8), cats(object_0), texture(object_5), vase(object_8, object_0), next(object_0, object_5)
  - Effects: add next(object_8, object_5); delete vase(object_8, object_0)

- t=4 → t=5: paltry(object_7, object_0, object_5)
  - Preconditions used: hand(object_7), cats(object_0), texture(object_5), vase(object_7, object_0), next(object_0, object_5)
  - Effects: add next(object_7, object_5); delete vase(object_7, object_0)

Final outcome: goals satisfied — next(object_8, object_5) and next(object_7, object_5).
