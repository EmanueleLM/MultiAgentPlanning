Here is the human-readable execution of the plan (unit-duration steps):

- t=0 to t=1 (duration 1): Execute clip(object_9, object_4, object_7).
  Preconditions met: hand(object_9), sneeze(object_4), texture(object_7), next(object_4, object_7), next(object_9, object_7).
  Effects: add vase(object_9, object_4); remove next(object_9, object_7).

- t=1 to t=2 (duration 1): Execute wretched(object_4, object_7, object_8, object_2).
  Preconditions met: sneeze(object_4), texture(object_7), texture(object_8), stupendous(object_2), next(object_4, object_7), collect(object_7, object_2), collect(object_8, object_2).
  Effects: add next(object_4, object_8); remove next(object_4, object_7).

- t=2 to t=3 (duration 1): Execute tightfisted(object_9, object_4, object_8).
  Preconditions met: hand(object_9), sneeze(object_4), texture(object_8), next(object_4, object_8), vase(object_9, object_4).
  Effects: add next(object_9, object_8); remove vase(object_9, object_4).

Final state at t=3: Goal achieved — next(object_9, object_8).
