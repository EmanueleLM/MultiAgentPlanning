FINAL-PLAN
------------------------------
I’m missing the concrete action_model, scenario_2, and audit_report content needed to build a faithful and solver-compatible PDDL. Please provide or confirm the following so I can emit the final domain and problem you requested:

1) Action model (exact tokens, lowercase)
- Full predicate vocabulary (names, argument lists, and any typing).
- All six actions paltry, sip, clip, wretched, memory, tightfisted with:
  - Parameters (with types if any).
  - Preconditions (no negative preconditions unless explicitly intended).
  - Effects (add/delete lists; if action costs are required, specify numeric fluents and increases).

2) scenario_2 (initial state and goal)
- Complete set of initial facts over objects object_0 … object_8 (and any additional typed objects, if applicable).
- Complete goal conditions. If there is an implied order or phased timeline, enumerate the phases/slots and their successor relation so I can enforce contiguity and ordering as hard constraints.

3) audit_report constraints
- Any hard constraints, preferences to be treated as hard (avoid/would rather/earliest/exactly/at most), mutual exclusions, capacities, or forbidden states that must be encoded directly (not via penalties or quota tokens).

4) Typing and objects
- Confirm whether all objects are of a single type (e.g., object), or provide the type hierarchy for object_0 … object_8 and any other constants required by the action model.

5) Costs (optional)
- If you require action costs, specify the metric and per-action cost so I can add matching (increase ...) effects and a :metric minimize total-cost in the problem; otherwise I will omit costs.

Once I have these specifics, I will return:
- <domain> … </domain> with name mystery-blocks, using only :strips, :typing, and (if you confirm) :negative-preconditions (and :action-costs only if needed).
- <problem> … </problem> named scenario-2 with objects object_0 … object_8, a fully enumerated initial state from scenario_2, and a goal that fixes every mandated terminal condition and enforces required ordering.

NATURAL-PLAN sas_plan_1
------------------------------
Here is the human-readable sequence that follows the plan exactly and achieves the goal next object_8 object_6:

1) Time 0.0–1.0 (duration 1): Execute sip(object_8, object_1, object_7)
   - Preconditions used: hand object_8, cats object_1, texture object_7, next object_8 object_7, next object_1 object_7
   - Effects: adds vase object_8 object_1; removes next object_8 object_7

2) Time 1.0–2.0 (duration 1): Execute memory(object_1, object_7, object_6)
   - Preconditions used: cats object_1, spring object_7, spring object_6, next object_1 object_7
   - Effects: adds next object_1 object_6; removes next object_1 object_7

3) Time 2.0–3.0 (duration 1): Execute paltry(object_8, object_1, object_6)
   - Preconditions used: hand object_8, cats object_1, texture object_6, vase object_8 object_1, next object_1 object_6
   - Effects: adds next object_8 object_6; removes vase object_8 object_1

Goal achieved: next object_8 object_6.

NATURAL-PLAN sas_plan_1
------------------------------
Here is the human-readable execution of the provided plan. All actions are instantaneous; we annotate each with a timestamp (t) and duration 1 time unit.

1) t=0, duration=1: memory(object_0, object_6, object_5)
- Effect: replace next(object_0, object_6) with next(object_0, object_5).

2) t=1, duration=1: sip(object_8, object_0, object_5)
- Effect: add vase(object_8, object_0); delete next(object_8, object_5).

3) t=2, duration=1: memory(object_0, object_5, object_6)
- Effect: replace next(object_0, object_5) with next(object_0, object_6).

4) t=3, duration=1: paltry(object_8, object_0, object_6)
- Effect: add next(object_8, object_6); delete vase(object_8, object_0).

Outcome: Goal achieved. next(object_7, object_6) was already true initially and remains true; next(object_8, object_6) becomes true at t=3.

NATURAL-PLAN sas_plan_10
------------------------------
Here is the human-readable execution of the provided plan (unit-duration steps with timestamps):

1) t=0 to 1 — memory(object_0, object_6, object_5)
- Preconditions: cats(object_0), spring(object_6), spring(object_5), next(object_0, object_6)
- Effect: redirect object_0’s link from object_6 to object_5
  - Add next(object_0, object_5)
  - Delete next(object_0, object_6)

2) t=1 to 2 — sip(object_8, object_0, object_5)
- Preconditions: hand(object_8), cats(object_0), texture(object_5), next(object_8, object_5), next(object_0, object_5)
- Effect: pair object_8 with object_0 via a vase and clear object_8’s link to object_5
  - Add vase(object_8, object_0)
  - Delete next(object_8, object_5)

3) t=2 to 3 — memory(object_0, object_5, object_6)
- Preconditions: cats(object_0), spring(object_5), spring(object_6), next(object_0, object_5)
- Effect: restore object_0’s link from object_5 back to object_6
  - Add next(object_0, object_6)
  - Delete next(object_0, object_5)

4) t=3 to 4 — paltry(object_8, object_0, object_6)
- Preconditions: hand(object_8), cats(object_0), texture(object_6), vase(object_8, object_0), next(object_0, object_6)
- Effect: create link from object_8 to object_6 and remove the vase link
  - Add next(object_8, object_6)
  - Delete vase(object_8, object_0)

Goal achieved at t=4:
- next(object_7, object_6) holds (unchanged throughout)
- next(object_8, object_6) achieved in step 4

NATURAL-PLAN sas_plan_5
------------------------------
Here is the human-readable execution of the given plan, with timestamps (unit duration = 1 time unit):

- t=0 → t=1: sip(object_8, object_0, object_6)
  - Preconditions used: hand(object_8), cats(object_0), texture(object_6), next(object_8, object_6), next(object_0, object_6)
  - Effects: add vase(object_8, object_0); delete next(object_8, object_6)

- t=1 → t=2: sip(object_7, object_0, object_6)
  - Preconditions used: hand(object_7), cats(object_0), texture(object_6), next(object_7, object_6), next(object_0, object_6)
  - Effects: add vase(object_7, object_0); delete next(object_7, object_6)

- t=2 → t=3: memory(object_0, object_6, object_5)
  - Preconditions used: cats(object_0), spring(object_6), spring(object_5), next(object_0, object_6)
  - Effects: add next(object_0, object_5); delete next(object_0, object_6)

- t=3 → t=4: paltry(object_8, object_0, object_5)
  - Preconditions used: hand(object_8), cats(object_0), texture(object_5), vase(object_8, object_0), next(object_0, object_5)
  - Effects: add next(object_8, object_5); delete vase(object_8, object_0)

- t=4 → t=5: paltry(object_7, object_0, object_5)
  - Preconditions used: hand(object_7), cats(object_0), texture(object_5), vase(object_7, object_0), next(object_0, object_5)
  - Effects: add next(object_7, object_5); delete vase(object_7, object_0)

Final outcome: goals satisfied — next(object_8, object_5) and next(object_7, object_5).

Here is the human-readable execution of the plan (unit-duration steps):

- t=0 to t=1 (duration 1): Execute clip(object_9, object_4, object_7).
  Preconditions met: hand(object_9), sneeze(object_4), texture(object_7), next(object_4, object_7), next(object_9, object_7).
  Effects: add vase(object_9, object_4); remove next(object_9, object_7).

- t=1 to t=2 (duration 1): Execute wretched(object_4, object_7, object_8, object_2).
  Preconditions met: sneeze(object_4), texture(object_7), texture(object_8), stupendous(object_2), next(object_4, object_7), collect(object_7, object_2), collect(object_8, object_2).
  Effects: add next(object_4, object_8); remove next(object_4, object_7).

- t=2 to t=3 (duration 1): Execute tightfisted(object_9, object_4, object_8).
  Preconditions met: hand(object_9), sneeze(object_4), texture(object_8), next(object_4, object_8), vase(object_9, object_4).
  Effects: add next(object_9, object_8); remove vase(object_9, object_4).

NATURAL-PLAN sas_plan_1
------------------------------
Here is the human-readable sequence of actions that follows the given plan exactly and achieves the goal (next object_10 object_6). Each step is assumed to take duration 1 time unit.

1) t=0 → 1 (duration 1): clip object_10 object_5 object_9
   - Use the hand-held object_10 with sneezy object_5 at textured object_9 to form vase(object_10, object_5) and remove next(object_10, object_9).

2) t=1 → 2 (duration 1): wretched object_5 object_9 object_8 object_3
   - Shift object_5’s linkage from object_9 to object_8 (given textures on 9 and 8, stupendous object_3, and required collects), replacing next(object_5, object_9) with next(object_5, object_8).

3) t=2 → 3 (duration 1): tightfisted object_10 object_5 object_8
   - With vase(object_10, object_5) and next(object_5, object_8), move object_10’s linkage to object_8 and remove the vase: add next(object_10, object_8), delete vase(object_10, object_5).

4) t=3 → 4 (duration 1): sip object_10 object_0 object_8
   - Using cats(object_0) and texture(object_8) with next(object_10, object_8) and next(object_0, object_8), create vase(object_10, object_0) and remove next(object_10, object_8).

5) t=4 → 5 (duration 1): memory object_0 object_8 object_6
   - With springs at object_8 and object_6 and next(object_0, object_8), shift object_0’s linkage to object_6: add next(object_0, object_6), delete next(object_0, object_8).

6) t=5 → 6 (duration 1): paltry object_10 object_0 object_6
   - With vase(object_10, object_0), cats(object_0), texture(object_6), and next(object_0, object_6), move object_10’s linkage to object_6 and remove the vase: add next(object_10, object_6), delete vase(object_10, object_0).

Result: Goal achieved — next object_10 object_6 is true at t=6.
