Here is the human-readable sequence of actions that follows the given plan exactly and achieves the goal (next object_10 object_6). Each step is assumed to take duration 1 time unit.

1) t=0 → 1 (duration 1): clip object_10 object_5 object_9
   - Use the hand-held object_10 with sneezy object_5 at textured object_9 to form vase(object_10, object_5) and remove next(object_10, object_9).

2) t=1 → 2 (duration 1): wretched object_5 object_9 object_8 object_3
   - Shift object_5’s linkage from object_9 to object_8 (given textures on 9 and 8, stupendous object_3, and required collects), replacing next(object_5, object_9) with next(object_5, object_8).

3) t=2 → 3 (duration 1): tightfisted object_10 object_5 object_8
   - With vase(object_10, object_5) and next(object_5, object_8), move object_10’s linkage to object_8 and remove the vase: add next(object_10, object_8), delete vase(object_10, object_5).

4) t=3 → 4 (duration 1): sip object_10 object_0 object_8
   - Using cats(object_0) and texture(object_8) with next(object_10, object_8) and next(object_0, object_8), create vase(object_10, object_0) and remove next(object_10, object_8).

5) t=4 → 5 (duration 1): memory object_0 object_8 object_6
   - With springs at object_8 and object_6 and next(object_0, object_8), shift object_0’s linkage to object_6: add next(object_0, object_6), delete next(object_0, object_8).

6) t=5 → 6 (duration 1): paltry object_10 object_0 object_6
   - With vase(object_10, object_0), cats(object_0), texture(object_6), and next(object_0, object_6), move object_10’s linkage to object_6 and remove the vase: add next(object_10, object_6), delete vase(object_10, object_0).

Result: Goal achieved — next object_10 object_6 is true at t=6.
