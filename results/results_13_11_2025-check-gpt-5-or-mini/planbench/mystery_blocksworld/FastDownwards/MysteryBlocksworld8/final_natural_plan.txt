Here is the human-readable version of the plan, following the given sequence exactly.

- t=0 → t=1: clip object_9 object_4 object_8
  - Preconditions used: hand object_9; sneeze object_4; texture object_8; next object_4 object_8; next object_9 object_8.
  - Effects: add vase object_9 object_4; delete next object_9 object_8.

- t=1 → t=2: wretched object_4 object_8 object_7 object_2
  - Preconditions used: sneeze object_4; texture object_8; texture object_7; stupendous object_2; next object_4 object_8; collect object_8 object_2; collect object_7 object_2.
  - Effects: add next object_4 object_7; delete next object_4 object_8.

- t=2 → t=3: tightfisted object_9 object_4 object_7
  - Preconditions used: hand object_9; sneeze object_4; texture object_7; next object_4 object_7; vase object_9 object_4.
  - Effects: add next object_9 object_7; delete vase object_9 object_4.

Goal achieved at t=3:
- next object_10 object_5 remains true from the start.
- next object_9 object_7 becomes true after the final step.
