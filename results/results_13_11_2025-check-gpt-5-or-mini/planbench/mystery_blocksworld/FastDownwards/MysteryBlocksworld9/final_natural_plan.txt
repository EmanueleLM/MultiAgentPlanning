Here is the human-readable action sequence that follows the plan exactly and reaches the goal. Each step assumes unit duration and sequential execution.

- Time 0–1 (duration 1): Execute WRETCHED on o0=object_5, o1=object_8, o2=object_9, o3=object_3
  - Effect: Re-route next(object_5, •) from object_8 to object_9.

- Time 1–2 (duration 1): Execute CLIP on o0=object_11, o1=object_5, o2=object_9
  - Effect: Establish vase(object_11, object_5) and remove next(object_11, object_9).

- Time 2–3 (duration 1): Execute WRETCHED on o0=object_5, o1=object_9, o2=object_8, o3=object_3
  - Effect: Re-route next(object_5, •) from object_9 back to object_8.

- Time 3–4 (duration 1): Execute TIGHTFISTED on o0=object_11, o1=object_5, o2=object_8
  - Effect: Set next(object_11, object_8) and clear vase(object_11, object_5).

- Time 4–5 (duration 1): Execute CLIP on o0=object_10, o1=object_4, o2=object_6
  - Effect: Establish vase(object_10, object_4) and remove next(object_10, object_6).

- Time 5–6 (duration 1): Execute WRETCHED on o0=object_4, o1=object_6, o2=object_7, o3=object_2
  - Effect: Re-route next(object_4, •) from object_6 to object_7.

- Time 6–7 (duration 1): Execute TIGHTFISTED on o0=object_10, o1=object_4, o2=object_7
  - Effect: Set next(object_10, object_7) and clear vase(object_10, object_4).

Outcome: Goal achieved with next(object_11, object_8) and next(object_10, object_7).
