Estimated timeline: start 00:00:00, each action ~10s. Total actions = 16, estimated total duration ~160s. Goal achieved after final step.

1) [00:00:00] consonant_agent — Move J from K onto H.
   - Action corresponds to (consonant_move_b2b j k h).
   - Precondition satisfied: J was the top block on K and H was clear.

2) [00:00:10] consonant_agent — Move K from A to the table.
   - Action corresponds to (consonant_move_b2t k a).
   - Precondition satisfied: K became clear after step 1, and K was on A.

3) [00:00:20] vowel_agent — Move A from L to the table.
   - Action corresponds to (vowel_move_b2t a l).
   - Precondition satisfied: A was a vowel, was clear (top of its stack) after step 2, and was on L.

4) [00:00:30] consonant_agent — Move L from C to the table.
   - Action corresponds to (consonant_move_b2t l c).
   - Precondition satisfied: L was clear (A had been moved off L) and was on C.

5) [00:00:40] consonant_agent — Move K from the table onto L.
   - Action corresponds to (consonant_move_t2b k l).
   - Precondition satisfied: K was on the table and clear; L was clear on the table.

6) [00:00:50] consonant_agent — Move J from H onto K.
   - Action corresponds to (consonant_move_b2b j h k).
   - Precondition satisfied: J was clear on H; K was clear (just placed on L).

7) [00:01:00] vowel_agent — Move I from G onto J.
   - Action corresponds to (vowel_move_b2b i g j).
   - Precondition satisfied: I is a vowel and was the top block on G; J was clear.

8) [00:01:10] consonant_agent — Move H from E onto I.
   - Action corresponds to (consonant_move_b2b h e i).
   - Precondition satisfied: H was clear on E; I was clear after step 7.

9) [00:01:20] consonant_agent — Move G from F onto H.
   - Action corresponds to (consonant_move_b2b g f h).
   - Precondition satisfied: G was clear on F; H was clear (H on I).

10) [00:01:30] consonant_agent — Move F from the table onto G.
    - Action corresponds to (consonant_move_t2b f g).
    - Precondition satisfied: F was on the table and clear; G was clear.

11) [00:01:40] vowel_agent — Move E from B onto F.
    - Action corresponds to (vowel_move_b2b e b f).
    - Precondition satisfied: E is a vowel and was clear on B; F was clear.

12) [00:01:50] consonant_agent — Move B from D onto A.
    - Action corresponds to (consonant_move_b2b b d a).
    - Precondition satisfied: B was clear on D (E moved off B in step 11); A was on the table and clear.

13) [00:02:00] consonant_agent — Move D from the table onto E.
    - Action corresponds to (consonant_move_t2b d e).
    - Precondition satisfied: D was on the table and clear; E was clear (on F).

14) [00:02:10] consonant_agent — Move C from the table onto D.
    - Action corresponds to (consonant_move_t2b c d).
    - Precondition satisfied: C was on the table and clear; D was clear (on E).

15) [00:02:20] consonant_agent — Move B from A onto C.
    - Action corresponds to (consonant_move_b2b b a c).
    - Precondition satisfied: B was clear on A; C was clear (on D).

16) [00:02:30] vowel_agent — Move A from the table onto B.
    - Action corresponds to (vowel_move_t2b a b).
    - Precondition satisfied: A is a vowel and was on the table and clear; B was clear (on C).

Result: Goal achieved — single descending stack L on table, then K on L, J on K, I on J, H on I, G on H, F on G, E on F, D on E, C on D, B on C, A on B.
Total cost (unit actions) = 16.
