Step 1 (time 0 → 1, duration = 1 unit, cost = 1):
- Action: vowel_agent executes vowel-move A from table to B.
- Natural description: The vowel agent picks up block A (a vowel) from the table and places it on top of block B.
- PDDL action form: (vowel-move A table B)

Resulting immediate effects:
- A is no longer on the table and now is on B.
- The table becomes clear (if nothing else was on that table position).
- B is no longer clear (it now has A on top).

Goal check after Step 1:
- All goal predicates hold:
  - A on B (achieved by this action)
  - B on C
  - C on D
  - D on E
  - E on F
  - F on G
  - G on H
  - H on I
  - I on J
  - J on table

The single planned action completes the task.
