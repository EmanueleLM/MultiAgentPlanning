Vowel agent: move I from on K to table.  \n2. Consonant agent: move K from on D to table.  \n\n(Dismantle the long F\u2013H\u2013J\u2013C\u2013E\u2013G\u2013B\u2013A stack into singletons on the table)\n\n3.

Consonant agent: move C from on J to table.  \n8. Consonant agent: move J from on H to table.  \n9. Consonant agent: move H from on F to table.  \n\n(At this point every block is in its own table stack: K, J, I, H, G, F, E, D, C, B, A.)\n\n(Build the final tower on K, bottom-up)\n\n10.
