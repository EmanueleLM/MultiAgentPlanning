PROBLEM
------------------------------
You are an expert at scheduling meetings. You are given a few constraints on the existing schedule of each participant, the meeting duration, and possibly some preferences on the meeting time. Note there exists a solution that works with existing schedule of every participant. Here are a few example tasks and solutions:

TASK: You need to schedule a meeting for Peter, Judith, Keith and Evelyn for half an hour between the work hours of 9:00 to 17:00 on Monday. 

Here are the existing schedules for everyone during the day: 
Peter has meetings on Monday during 9:00 to 9:30, 10:30 to 11:00, 11:30 to 12:00, 12:30 to 13:00; 
Judith's calendar is wide open the entire day.
Keith has blocked their calendar on Monday during 11:30 to 12:00, 12:30 to 15:00, 15:30 to 16:00, 16:30 to 17:00; 
Evelyn is busy on Monday during 9:00 to 12:30, 13:30 to 15:30, 16:30 to 17:00; 

Find a time that works for everyone's schedule and constraints.

You will receive participants' availability reports: {avail_peter}, {avail_judith}, {avail_keith}, {avail_evelyn}. Use these to construct a PDDL domain and a PDDL problem that schedule a single 30-minute meeting on Monday between 09:00 and 17:00 so that all participants are available for the entire meeting. Use discrete 30-minute time slots matching the environment init time_granularity_minutes. Do not assume any availability information beyond what participants provided. Ensure the domain and problem are executable by the FastDownward solver and keep participants' actions or resources distinct so a multi-agent schedule is clear. Enclose the PDDL domain between <domain></domain> tags and the PDDL problem between <problem></problem> tags."

------------------------------
1) Propose timeslot ts15 — Orchestrator proposes a 30-minute meeting on Monday at 16:00–16:30 (ts15).

2) Confirm (evelyn, ts15) — Evelyn confirms she is available for 16:00–16:30 on Monday.

3) Finalize ts15 (using evelyn’s confirmation) — Orchestrator finalizes and schedules the meeting for Monday 16:00–16:30 (30 minutes, ts15) for all participants (peter, judith, keith, evelyn). The meeting is now scheduled and satisfies the goal of placing a single 30-minute meeting on Monday between 09:00 and 17:00.
