Step 1 — Schedule the meeting:
- Action: Schedule a 30-minute meeting at slot s15_30.
- Time: Monday 15:30–16:00 (duration 30 minutes).
- Participants (in plan order): Jacob, Margaret, Mason, Shirley, Stephen.

Outcome/effects:
- The meeting is now scheduled (meeting-scheduled = true).
- The meeting is recorded at slot s15_30.
- The s15_30 availability is consumed for Jacob, Margaret, Mason, Shirley, and Stephen (they are no longer available at that slot).
- Margaret's preference is respected (meeting is after 14:30).
