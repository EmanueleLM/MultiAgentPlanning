Step 1 — Schedule the meeting (14:30–15:00, Monday)
- Action taken: schedule s1430_1500
- Result: A 30-minute meeting is selected and marked scheduled for Monday 14:30–15:00.
- Participants: Roy, Kathryn, Amy
- Why this slot: all three participants are available at 14:30–15:00, and the slot ends before 15:30, so Amy’s preference to avoid meeting after 15:30 is satisfied.
