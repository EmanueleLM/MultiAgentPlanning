Step 1 — schedule-preferred s5:
- Action: Schedule a 30-minute meeting (PDDL action: schedule-preferred s5).
- When: Monday, 11:00–11:30 (slot s5).
- Participants: Christine, Janice, Bobby, Elizabeth, Tyler, Edward.
- Reason: s5 is marked as a preferred slot (before 13:00) and none of the participants are busy at that time, so the meeting is both scheduled and satisfies the preferred-slot objective.

Result: Meeting scheduled on Monday 11:00–11:30 for all participants; the final goals (meeting-scheduled and scheduled-preferred) are satisfied.
