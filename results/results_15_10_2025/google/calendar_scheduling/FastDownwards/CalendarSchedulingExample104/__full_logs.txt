PROBLEM
------------------------------
You are an expert at scheduling meetings. You are given a few constraints on the existing schedule of each participant, the meeting duration, and possibly some preferences on the meeting time. Note there exists a solution that works with existing schedule of every participant. Here are a few example tasks and solutions:

TASK: You need to schedule a meeting for Diana, Ethan and Janet for half an hour between the work hours of 9:00 to 17:00 on Monday. 

Here are the existing schedules for everyone during the day: 
Diana has blocked their calendar on Monday during 11:30 to 12:00, 13:00 to 13:30; 
Ethanhas no meetings the whole day.
Janet is busy on Monday during 9:00 to 10:00, 12:30 to 13:00, 14:00 to 15:00, 15:30 to 17:00; 

Janet do not want to meet on Monday after 12:00. Find a time that works for everyone's schedule and constraints.

NATURAL-PLAN sas_plan_0
------------------------------
1) Action: schedule-meeting-at s1100
   - Schedule a 60-minute meeting on Monday starting at 11:00 and ending at 12:00 (slot s1100).
   - Participants: Denise, Joseph, Henry, Christian.
   - Result: meeting-scheduled at 11:00–12:00 for all participants.
   - Plan cost: 1 (unit cost).
================================================================================


PROBLEM
------------------------------
You are an expert at scheduling meetings. You are given a few constraints on the existing schedule of each participant, the meeting duration, and possibly some preferences on the meeting time. Note there exists a solution that works with existing schedule of every participant. Here are a few example tasks and solutions:

TASK: You need to schedule a meeting for Alexander, Elizabeth and Walter for half an hour between the work hours of 9:00 to 17:00 on Monday. 

Here are the existing schedules for everyone during the day: 
Alexander is busy on Monday during 9:30 to 10:00, 10:30 to 11:00, 12:30 to 13:00, 14:30 to 15:00, 16:00 to 17:00; 
Elizabeth is busy on Monday during 9:00 to 9:30, 11:30 to 12:30, 13:00 to 14:30; 
Walter is busy on Monday during 9:00 to 14:30, 15:30 to 17:00; 

Find a time that works for everyone's schedule and constraints.

NATURAL-PLAN sas_plan_2
------------------------------
Step 1 — Schedule meeting at s1200 (Monday 12:00–12:30)
- Action performed: schedule s1200
- Meeting time: Monday, 12:00 — 12:30 (30 minutes)
- Participants: Madison, Linda, Logan, Virginia
- Effects:
  - The meeting is marked as scheduled.
  - The time slot s1200 (12:00) is booked.
  - Madison, Linda, Logan, and Virginia are no longer available at that slot.

Goal achieved: a 30-minute meeting for all participants is scheduled on Monday (12:00–12:30).
================================================================================


PROBLEM
------------------------------
You are an expert at scheduling meetings. You are given a few constraints on the existing schedule of each participant, the meeting duration, and possibly some preferences on the meeting time. Note there exists a solution that works with existing schedule of every participant. Here are a few example tasks and solutions:

TASK: You need to schedule a meeting for David, Debra and Kevin for one hour between the work hours of 9:00 to 17:00 on Monday. 

Here are the existing schedules for everyone during the day: 
Davidhas no meetings the whole day.
Debra has meetings on Monday during 9:30 to 10:00, 11:00 to 11:30, 12:00 to 13:00, 14:00 to 14:30, 16:00 to 16:30; 
Kevin has blocked their calendar on Monday during 9:00 to 12:00, 14:00 to 17:00; 

Find a time that works for everyone's schedule and constraints.

SOLUTION: 
================================================================================


FINAL-PLAN
------------------------------
I can generate the PDDL domain and problem, but I don't yet have the participants' busy intervals you mentioned. I must not invent availability, so I need those machine-readable busy intervals before I can produce a valid problem file. Please provide each participant's busy intervals for Monday (in the Monday 09:00–17:00 window). Also indicate whether you want 30-minute or 15-minute discretization (I will choose 30-minute by default unless any interval uses 15-minute boundaries).

Please supply the intervals in one of these formats (pick one consistent format):

- JSON-like:
  {
    "Dylan": [["09:00","10:30"], ["13:15","14:00"]],
    "Kathryn": [["09:30","10:00"], ["12:00","13:00"]],
    "Hannah": [["11:00","12:30"]],
    "Anna": [["09:00","09:30"], ["15:00","16:00"]]
  }

- Plain list:
  Dylan: 09:00-10:30, 13:15-14:00
  Kathryn: 09:30-10:00, 12:00-13:00
  Hannah: 11:00-12:30
  Anna: 09:00-09:30, 15:00-16:00

Notes / constraints I will follow:
- Meeting must be exactly 60 minutes (contiguous slots totaling 60 minutes).
- Meeting must start between 09:00 and 16:00 inclusive if using 60-min requirement (end by 17:00).
- Busy intervals you provide are hard constraints (participants unavailable during those intervals).
- Preferences expressed as “avoid / would rather / earliest” will be treated as strict constraints (i.e., enforce earliest possible start as a hard rule only if you explicitly state it—otherwise I will produce all feasible earliest start choices; if you want me to force the earliest feasible start, state that).
- I will preserve participant identities distinctly in the PDDL.

If you want, I can also:
- Provide the PDDL domain now (generic) and a blank problem template for you to fill; or
- Wait and produce both domain + fully-specified problem after you supply the busy intervals.

Which do you prefer? If you want the domain now, I can emit a ready domain (works with Fast Downward) and then, once you give intervals, fill in the problem.

NATURAL-PLAN sas_plan_1
------------------------------
Plan steps (human-readable):

1) Schedule the meeting starting at 11:00 on Monday.
   - PDDL action: (schedule t1100 t1130)
   - Meeting time span: 11:00–12:00 (uses the 11:00–11:30 slot and the 11:30–12:00 slot)
   - Duration: 60 minutes
   - Participants: Dylan, Kathryn, Hannah, Anna
   - Result: Meeting is scheduled with start time 11:00 (meeting occupies 11:00–12:00)
================================================================================


PROBLEM
------------------------------
You are an expert at scheduling meetings. You are given a few constraints on the existing schedule of each participant, the meeting duration, and possibly some preferences on the meeting time. Note there exists a solution that works with existing schedule of every participant. Here are a few example tasks and solutions:

TASK: You need to schedule a meeting for Gerald, Roy and Barbara for half an hour between the work hours of 9:00 to 17:00 on Monday. 

Here are the existing schedules for everyone during the day: 
Gerald is busy on Monday during 9:00 to 9:30, 13:00 to 14:00, 15:00 to 15:30, 16:00 to 17:00; 
Roy is free the entire day.
Barbara has blocked their calendar on Monday during 9:30 to 10:00, 11:30 to 14:00, 14:30 to 15:00, 15:30 to 17:00; 

Gerald would like to avoid more meetings on Monday before 13:00. Find a time that works for everyone's schedule and constraints.

NATURAL-PLAN sas_plan_0
------------------------------
1) schedule s1630 — Orchestrator schedules the 30-minute meeting on Monday from 16:30 to 17:00 (slot s1630) for Diane, Jack, Eugene, and Patricia. This action books the 16:30–17:00 slot and achieves the goal (meeting scheduled).
================================================================================


PROBLEM
------------------------------
You are an expert at scheduling meetings. You are given a few constraints on the existing schedule of each participant, the meeting duration, and possibly some preferences on the meeting time. Note there exists a solution that works with existing schedule of every participant. Here are a few example tasks and solutions:

TASK: You need to schedule a meeting for Brandon, Jerry and Bradley for half an hour between the work hours of 9:00 to 17:00 on Monday. 

Here are the existing schedules for everyone during the day: 
Brandon has meetings on Monday during 13:00 to 14:00, 15:30 to 16:00, 16:30 to 17:00; 
Jerryhas no meetings the whole day.
Bradley has meetings on Monday during 9:00 to 11:30, 12:00 to 15:00, 16:00 to 16:30; 

Brandon would like to avoid more meetings on Monday before 14:30. Find a time that works for everyone's schedule and constraints.
