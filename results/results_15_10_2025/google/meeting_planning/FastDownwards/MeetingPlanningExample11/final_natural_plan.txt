Summary of time mapping used in the plan:
- t0  = 09:00
- t300 = 14:00
- t375 = 15:15
(Thus t300 → t375 = 75 minutes.)

Step-by-step human-readable actions (matching the plan exactly):

1) Visitor waits at Nob_Hill from 09:00 (t0) until 14:00 (t300).
   - Action: visitor-wait t0 t300
   - Duration: 5 hours (09:00 → 14:00)

2) Visitor meets Carol at Sunset_District from 14:00 (t300) until 15:15 (t375).
   - Action: visitor-meet-carol carol carol sunset_district t300 t375
   - Meeting duration: 75 minutes (14:00 → 15:15)
   - Effects: Carol is marked as met and accounted; the meeting satisfies Carol’s minimum 75-minute requirement.

Final status:
- Goal achieved: Carol is accounted for (met).
- Plan cost: 0 (as reported).
