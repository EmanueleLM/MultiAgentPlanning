Here is a clear, step-by-step, human-readable execution of the provided plan. I list preconditions that are checked before each action, the action effects, a timestamp/duration for each step (unit durations), and the state changes that result.

Initial relevant facts (from the problem):
- hand: object_8, object_7
- cats: object_0, object_1
- texture: object_5, object_6, object_7
- next: object_0→object_7, object_1→object_7, object_4→object_6, object_5→object_7, object_8→object_7, object_0→object_6, object_3→object_5, object_7→object_6, object_8→object_5
- other facts (collect, sneeze, spring, stupendous) as given but not needed for these two actions

Planned actions (in order; do not add or remove steps):
1) sip object_8 object_0 object_7
   - Timestamp: t = 0.0
   - Duration: 1.0 time unit
   - Action meaning (from the domain): create vase(object_8, object_0) and remove next(object_8, object_7)
   - Preconditions checked before execution:
     - hand object_8 — present
     - cats object_0 — present
     - texture object_7 — present
     - next object_8 object_7 — present
     - next object_0 object_7 — present
     All preconditions are satisfied in the initial state.
   - Effects applied at completion (t = 1.0):
     - Added: vase(object_8, object_0)
     - Removed: next(object_8, object_7)
   - Resulting relevant state after step 1:
     - vase(object_8, object_0) is now true
     - next(object_8, object_7) is now false
     - All other initially true facts remain unless listed above

2) paltry object_8 object_0 object_6
   - Timestamp: t = 1.0
   - Duration: 1.0 time unit
   - Action meaning (from the domain): add next(object_8, object_6) and remove vase(object_8, object_0)
   - Preconditions checked before execution (at t = 1.0):
     - hand object_8 — present
     - cats object_0 — present
     - texture object_6 — present
     - vase object_8 object_0 — present (created by step 1) — satisfied
     - next object_0 object_6 — present in the initial state — satisfied
     All preconditions are satisfied after step 1.
   - Effects applied at completion (t = 2.0):
     - Added: next(object_8, object_6)
     - Removed: vase(object_8, object_0)
   - Resulting relevant state after step 2:
     - next(object_8, object_6) is now true (goal-achieving fact)
     - vase(object_8, object_0) is now false
     - next(object_7, object_6) remained true from the initial state

Final check (after t = 2.0):
- Goal required: next object_7 object_6 and next object_8 object_6
  - next(object_7, object_6) was true in the initial state and remained true
  - next(object_8, object_6) was produced by step 2
- Both goal facts are satisfied. The plan succeeds (cost = 2 actions, unit cost each).
