PROBLEM
------------------------------
I am playing with a set of objects. Here are the actions I can do

Paltry object_0 object_1 object_2.

NATURAL-PLAN sas_plan_0
------------------------------
Step 1 — (time 0.0 → 1.0; duration 1.0, cost = 1)
- Action: sip
- Agent: planner_agent
- Parameters (concrete binding): src = object_5, target = object_8, child = object_6
- Informal description: planner_agent reattaches child object_6 from its current parent object_5 to become the successor of object_8.

Preconditions required by sip:
1. (agent planner_agent) — planner_agent must exist as an actor.
   - Satisfied: present in the problem initial facts.
2. (next object_5 object_6) — child must currently be linked to src parent object_5.
   - Satisfied: initial facts include next object_5 object_6.
3. (succ-free object_8) — the target parent must be free to accept a successor.
   - Satisfied: initial facts include succ-free object_8.

Effects of the action (applied at the end of the step):
- Deletes: (next object_5 object_6) — the old link from object_5 to object_6 is removed.
- Adds: (next object_8 object_6) — a new link from object_8 to object_6 is created.
- Adds: (succ-free object_5) — object_5 becomes successor-free because it lost its child.
- Deletes (implicit in the sip schema): (succ-free object_8) — object_8 is no longer successor-free after receiving object_6.

State consequences relevant to the goal:
- After this action the fact (next object_8 object_6) holds, which exactly satisfies the planning goal.
- No preconditions were missing or ambiguous; all required facts were present in the initial state and no additional assumptions were needed.

Conclusion: Executing the single plan step sip planner_agent object_5 object_8 object_6 (duration 1.0) is valid from the given initial state and achieves the goal next object_8 object_6.

NATURAL-PLAN sas_plan_0
------------------------------
Here is a clear, step-by-step, human-readable execution of the provided plan. I list preconditions that are checked before each action, the action effects, a timestamp/duration for each step (unit durations), and the state changes that result.

Initial relevant facts (from the problem):
- hand: object_8, object_7
- cats: object_0, object_1
- texture: object_5, object_6, object_7
- next: object_0→object_7, object_1→object_7, object_4→object_6, object_5→object_7, object_8→object_7, object_0→object_6, object_3→object_5, object_7→object_6, object_8→object_5
- other facts (collect, sneeze, spring, stupendous) as given but not needed for these two actions

Planned actions (in order; do not add or remove steps):
1) sip object_8 object_0 object_7
   - Timestamp: t = 0.0
   - Duration: 1.0 time unit
   - Action meaning (from the domain): create vase(object_8, object_0) and remove next(object_8, object_7)
   - Preconditions checked before execution:
     - hand object_8 — present
     - cats object_0 — present
     - texture object_7 — present
     - next object_8 object_7 — present
     - next object_0 object_7 — present
     All preconditions are satisfied in the initial state.
   - Effects applied at completion (t = 1.0):
     - Added: vase(object_8, object_0)
     - Removed: next(object_8, object_7)
   - Resulting relevant state after step 1:
     - vase(object_8, object_0) is now true
     - next(object_8, object_7) is now false
     - All other initially true facts remain unless listed above

2) paltry object_8 object_0 object_6
   - Timestamp: t = 1.0
   - Duration: 1.0 time unit
   - Action meaning (from the domain): add next(object_8, object_6) and remove vase(object_8, object_0)
   - Preconditions checked before execution (at t = 1.0):
     - hand object_8 — present
     - cats object_0 — present
     - texture object_6 — present
     - vase object_8 object_0 — present (created by step 1) — satisfied
     - next object_0 object_6 — present in the initial state — satisfied
     All preconditions are satisfied after step 1.
   - Effects applied at completion (t = 2.0):
     - Added: next(object_8, object_6)
     - Removed: vase(object_8, object_0)
   - Resulting relevant state after step 2:
     - next(object_8, object_6) is now true (goal-achieving fact)
     - vase(object_8, object_0) is now false
     - next(object_7, object_6) remained true from the initial state

Final check (after t = 2.0):
- Goal required: next object_7 object_6 and next object_8 object_6
  - next(object_7, object_6) was true in the initial state and remained true
  - next(object_8, object_6) was produced by step 2
- Both goal facts are satisfied. The plan succeeds (cost = 2 actions, unit cost each).

FINAL-PLAN
------------------------------
I don’t have the contents of analysis_1 and analysis_2 from the other agents — those are required to produce a correct, conservative PDDL domain + problem(s). Please provide the two structured analyses (analysis_1 and analysis_2). To make sure I produce a Fast Downward–compatible PDDL set that preserves all constraints, please include (or confirm) the following items in each analysis:

Required content for each analysis (please paste the structured output you received):
- Objects/entities (with types if available). Example: tasks, agents, resources, locations, time-slots.
- Actions (informal schemas): for each action list
  - name
  - parameters (types)
  - preconditions (positive/negative)
  - effects (adds and deletes)
  - duration if any (or instantaneous)
  - whether action is exclusive on a resource (resource locking)
- Initial state facts (which predicates are true at start; any numeric/time values)
- Goals (logical conditions that must hold at the end)
- Hard constraints / preferences expressed as strict constraints that must be enforced (e.g., "A cannot start before time 10", "X and Y cannot be scheduled concurrently", "prefer earliest but treat as hard earliest")
- If time windows or availability slots exist, provide exact start/end times or discrete slots and which agent/resource each applies to.

Optional but very helpful:
- Types hierarchy (e.g., agent, vehicle, package)
- A small example plan (if known) to clarify intended semantics
- Any deadlines or maxima (e.g., "all tasks must finish by T=100")

How I will produce the PDDL (what you can expect):
- I will merge the distinct action schemas from both analyses into a single domain file, keeping actions logically separate and preserving their preconditions and effects exactly as given.
- I will model resources and exclusivity conservatively (e.g., use mutex predicates or numeric resource counters) and encode natural-language preferences as hard constraints as you required.
- If time is involved, I will use PDDL 2.1 durative-actions and numeric fluents to model start/finish times and durations; I will treat "earliest" constraints as hard numeric inequalities.
- Any ambiguity will be resolved conservatively (I will document these resolution choices inside PDDL comments).
- I will wrap the domain in <domain>...</domain> and each problem in <problem>...</problem> tags as you requested, and include comments to map problems to scenarios if multiple problem files are needed.

If you prefer, you can also paste the raw natural-language descriptions and I will extract and convert them into the structured analyses myself — but that will require me to make more assumptions and I will document them explicitly.

When you paste analysis_1 and analysis_2 I will produce:
- One .pddl domain file enclosed in <domain> tags
- One or more .pddl problem files enclosed in <problem> tags (with comments mapping scenario → problem)
- In-PDDL comments explaining any conservative assumptions I had to make

Send analysis_1 and analysis_2 and I’ll generate the PDDL files.

Step 1 — time 0s (duration 1s)
Action: memory_analyst1(object_1, object_6, object_7)
- Agent: analyst1
- Meaning: move the "next" link for object_1 from object_6 to object_7.
- Preconditions checked: cats(object_1), spring(object_6), spring(object_7), next(object_1, object_6).
- Effects applied: add next(object_1, object_7); remove next(object_1, object_6).

Step 2 — time 1s (duration 1s)
Action: sip_analyst1(object_9, object_1, object_7)
- Agent: analyst1
- Meaning: create vase(object_9, object_1) by using the shared next links to object_7.
- Preconditions checked: hand(object_9), cats(object_1), texture(object_7), next(object_9, object_7), next(object_1, object_7).
- Effects applied: add vase(object_9, object_1); remove next(object_9, object_7).

Step 3 — time 2s (duration 1s)
Action: memory_analyst1(object_1, object_7, object_6)
- Agent: analyst1
- Meaning: move the "next" link for object_1 from object_7 back to object_6.
- Preconditions checked: cats(object_1), spring(object_7), spring(object_6), next(object_1, object_7).
- Effects applied: add next(object_1, object_6); remove next(object_1, object_7).

Step 4 — time 3s (duration 1s)
Action: paltry_analyst1(object_9, object_1, object_6)
- Agent: analyst1
- Meaning: use vase(object_9, object_1) and next(object_1, object_6) to create next(object_9, object_6) (and consume the vase).
- Preconditions checked: hand(object_9), cats(object_1), texture(object_6), vase(object_9, object_1), next(object_1, object_6).
- Effects applied: add next(object_9, object_6); remove vase(object_9, object_1).

Result (after 4 steps)
- Goal facts achieved: next(object_8, object_7) (already true from the initial state) and next(object_9, object_6) (established at Step 4).
- Plan cost: 4 steps.

FINAL-PLAN
------------------------------
I don’t have the two agents’ analysis artifacts nor the public action model in your message. I can’t safely invent initial facts or action preconditions/effects because you explicitly required I not add unavailable facts. Please provide the missing pieces so I can generate correct FastDownwards-compatible PDDL.

To proceed, please paste (or summarize) these items:

1. Public action model: for each action named paltry, sip, clip, wretched, memory, tightfisted provide:
   - action name
   - parameter list (objects and types)
   - preconditions (positive and negative predicates)
   - effects (add and delete predicates)
   - if temporal/durational, the duration and any time-based constraints (otherwise we’ll produce classical PDDL)

2. Agent analyses:
   - agent_A: its initial facts (predicates and objects), which actions it can perform (if different from the public actions), and its goal(s) or constraints (e.g., “avoid slot X”, “earliest time before Y”).
   - agent_B: same as above.

3. Any typing information (object types, e.g., agent, tool, slot), and any shared/static predicates.

4. Which scenario you want:
   - a single combined problem that includes both agents and a joint goal, or
   - two separate problem instances (one per agent).

5. Any hard temporal constraints to encode as strict constraints (e.g., “slot S is unavailable”, “must finish before time T”). If you need time modeling, say whether numeric/time PDDL or timeline is acceptable (FastDownwards supports PDDL2.1 numeric durative actions — I can use durative actions if you provide durations).

If you want, you can paste the agent_A and agent_B analyses and the public model exactly as you have them; I’ll convert them into a FastDownwards-compatible PDDL domain and problem and enclose them in <domain>...</domain> and <problem>...</problem> tags.

NATURAL-PLAN sas_plan_1
------------------------------
Summary: The following is a step-by-step, human-readable trace of the supplied PDDL plan. Each step shows the action, its parameters, which preconditions are being used (from the current state), the state change (effects), an estimated timestamp/duration (1 time unit per action), and a short note on whether the preconditions hold. The trace follows the plan exactly and ends by confirming the requested goals are achieved.

Assumed start time t = 0.0. Each action is treated as taking 1.0 time unit. Total cost = 8.

1) t = 0.0 → 1.0
Action: clip object_9 object_4 object_7
- Meaning (from domain): With hand = object_9 and sneeze = object_4 and texture = object_7, if next(object_4, object_7) and next(object_9, object_7) hold, create vase(object_9, object_4) and remove next(object_9, object_7).
- Preconditions used: hand(object_9), sneeze(object_4), texture(object_7), next(object_4,object_7), next(object_9,object_7).
- Are preconditions satisfied now? Yes (next object_4 object_7 and next object_9 object_7 are present initially).
- Effects (state change): add (vase object_9 object_4); delete (next object_9 object_7).
- Note: After this step next(9,7) is removed; vase(9,4) appears.

2) t = 1.0 → 2.0
Action: tightfisted object_9 object_4 object_8
- Meaning: With hand = object_9, sneeze = object_4, texture = object_8, if next(object_4,object_8) and vase(object_9,object_4) hold, produce next(object_9,object_8) and remove vase(object_9,object_4).
- Preconditions used: hand(object_9), sneeze(object_4), texture(object_8), next(object_4,object_8), vase(object_9,object_4).
- Are preconditions satisfied now? Yes (next object_4 object_8 was in the initial state; vase(9,4) was created in step 1).
- Effects: add (next object_9 object_8); delete (vase object_9 object_4).
- Note: After this step next(9,8) exists (goal-relevant).

3) t = 2.0 → 3.0
Action: wretched object_3 object_5 object_6 object_1
- Meaning: With sneeze = object_3, textures = object_5 & object_6, stupendous = object_1, if next(object_3,object_5) and collect(object_5,object_1) and collect(object_6,object_1) hold, change next(object_3,object_5) into next(object_3,object_6) (i.e., add next(3,6) and remove next(3,5)).
- Preconditions used: sneeze(object_3), texture(object_5), texture(object_6), stupendous(object_1), next(object_3,object_5), collect(object_5,object_1), collect(object_6,object_1).
- Are preconditions satisfied now? Yes (these facts are present in the initial state).
- Effects: add (next object_3 object_6); delete (next object_3 object_5).
- Note: Next link for object_3 moves from object_5 to object_6.

4) t = 3.0 → 4.0
Action: clip object_9 object_3 object_6
- Meaning: With hand = object_9 and sneeze = object_3 and texture = object_6, if next(object_3,object_6) and next(object_9,object_6) hold, create vase(object_9,object_3) and remove next(object_9,object_6).
- Preconditions used: hand(object_9), sneeze(object_3), texture(object_6), next(object_3,object_6), next(object_9,object_6).
- Are preconditions satisfied now? Yes (next(3,6) was added in step 3; next(9,6) existed initially).
- Effects: add (vase object_9 object_3); delete (next object_9 object_6).
- Note: vase(9,3) appears; next(9,6) is removed.

5) t = 4.0 → 5.0
Action: wretched object_3 object_6 object_5 object_1
- Meaning: With sneeze = object_3, textures = object_6 & object_5, stupendous = object_1, if next(object_3,object_6) and collect(object_6,object_1) and collect(object_5,object_1) hold, change next(object_3,object_6) into next(object_3,object_5).
- Preconditions used: sneeze(object_3), texture(object_6), texture(object_5), stupendous(object_1), next(object_3,object_6), collect(object_6,object_1), collect(object_5,object_1).
- Are preconditions satisfied now? Yes (next(3,6) exists from step 3; collect facts were initial).
- Effects: add (next object_3 object_5); delete (next object_3 object_6).
- Note: This reverts object_3’s next link back to object_5.

6) t = 5.0 → 6.0
Action: tightfisted object_9 object_3 object_5
- Meaning: With hand = object_9, sneeze = object_3, texture = object_5, if next(object_3,object_5) and vase(object_9,object_3) hold, produce next(object_9,object_5) and remove vase(object_9,object_3).
- Preconditions used: hand(object_9), sneeze(object_3), texture(object_5), next(object_3,object_5), vase(object_9,object_3).
- Are preconditions satisfied now? Yes (next(3,5) was restored in step 5; vase(9,3) created in step 4).
- Effects: add (next object_9 object_5); delete (vase object_9 object_3).
- Note: next(9,5) now exists.

7) t = 6.0 → 7.0
Action: sip object_9 object_0 object_5
- Meaning: With hand = object_9 and cats = object_0 and texture = object_5, if next(object_9,object_5) and next(object_0,object_5) hold, create vase(object_9,object_0) and remove next(object_9,object_5).
- Preconditions used: hand(object_9), cats(object_0), texture(object_5), next(object_9,object_5), next(object_0,object_5).
- Are preconditions satisfied now? Yes (next(9,5) from step 6; next(0,5) was in initial state).
- Effects: add (vase object_9 object_0); delete (next object_9 object_5).
- Note: vase(9,0) appears.

8) t = 7.0 → 8.0
Action: paltry object_9 object_0 object_7
- Meaning: With hand = object_9 and cats = object_0 and texture = object_7, if vase(object_9,object_0) and next(object_0,object_7) hold, create next(object_9,object_7) and remove vase(object_9,object_0).
- Preconditions used: hand(object_9), cats(object_0), texture(object_7), vase(object_9,object_0), next(object_0,object_7).
- Are preconditions satisfied now? Yes (vase(9,0) was created in step 7; next(0,7) was present initially).
- Effects: add (next object_9 object_7); delete (vase object_9 object_0).
- Note: next(9,7) is restored/created.

Final state relevant facts (after step 8)
- next(object_9, object_8) — created in step 2
- next(object_9, object_7) — created in step 8

Goal check
- Required goal: (next object_9 object_8) and (next object_9 object_7).
- Both are present in the final state (see notes above). Therefore the plan achieves the goal.

Total plan duration (estimated): 8.0 time units
Total cost (as given): 8

Step 4: tightfisted object_9 object_3 object_5
- Parameters: ?x=object_9, ?y=object_3, ?z=object_5
- Minimal preconditions verifiable after Step 3:

Conclusion (Scenario 1)
- Every step is fully supported by the provided initial facts and by effects of earlier steps in the fragment. No unknown facts were required. The proposed plan is valid under the public action schemas and initial facts and achieves the scenario goal next object_9 object_7.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
Structured plan fragment — Scenario 2 (player_B)

Public action schemas (same as Scenario 1 list above).

No user plan provided. Below are feasible actions (one-step and short sequences) that are verifiably applicable from initial facts, plus analysis about reaching the goal. Where a step does not directly lead to the goal, I indicate missing facts necessary to make progress.

Feasible single actions from initial state (verified applicability):

A) clip object_10 object_5 object_9
- Parameters: ?x=object_10, ?y=object_5, ?z=object_9
- Precondition check:
  - hand object_10 (present)
  - sneeze object_5 (present)
  - texture object_9 (present)
  - next object_5 object_9 (present)
  - next object_10 object_9 (present)
- Effects:
  - add vase object_10 object_5
  - del next object_10 object_9
- Validation: Applicable. Creates vase(object_10,object_5).

B) wretched object_4 object_6 object_7 object_2
- Parameters: ?x=object_4, ?y=object_6, ?z=object_7, ?w=object_2
- Precondition check:
  - sneeze object_4 (present)
  - texture object_6 (present)
  - texture object_7 (present)
  - stupendous object_2 (present)
  - next object_4 object_6 (present)
  - collect object_6 object_2 (present)
  - collect object_7 object_2 (present)
- Effects:
  - add next object_4 object_7
  - del next object_4 object_6
- Validation: Applicable. Changes next(object_4,object_6) -> next(object_4,object_7).

C) wretched object_5 object_9 object_8 object_3
- Parameters: ?x=object_5, ?y=object_9, ?z=object_8, ?w=object_3
- Precondition check:
  - sneeze object_5 (present)
  - texture object_9 (present)
  - texture object_8 (present)
  - stupendous object_3 (present)
  - next object_5 object_9 (present)
  - collect object_9 object_3 (present)
  - collect object_8 object_3 (present)
- Effects:
  - add next object_5 object_8
  - del next object_5 object_9
- Validation: Applicable.

D) memory object_0 object_8 object_6
- Parameters: ?x=object_0, ?y=object_8, ?z=object_6
- Precondition check:
  - cats object_0 (present)
  - spring object_8 (present)
  - spring object_6 (present)
  - next object_0 object_8 (present)
- Effects:
  - add next object_0 object_6
  - del next object_0 object_8
- Validation: Applicable.

E) memory object_1 object_6 object_8
- Parameters: ?x=object_1, ?y=object_6, ?z=object_8
- Precondition check:
  - cats object_1 (present)
  - spring object_6 (present)
  - spring object_8 (present)
  - next object_1 object_6 (present)
- Effects:
  - add next object_1 object_8
  - del next object_1 object_6
- Validation: Applicable.

F) clip object_10 object_4 object_6
- Precondition check requires next object_4 object_6 (present) and next object_10 object_6 (NOT present).
- Since next object_10 object_6 is not present, clip object_10 object_4 object_6 is not applicable now.

G) sip / paltry / tightfisted uses: many require combinations that are not currently jointly present (see below).

Assessment: is the goal next object_10 object_6 reachable with available facts and valid actions?

- The goal next(object_10,object_6) can be produced by:
  1) tightfisted(object_10, Y, object_6) if vase(object_10, Y) and next(Y, object_6) and sneeze(Y), texture object_6 present and hand object_10. OR
  2) paltry(object_10, Y, object_6) if vase(object_10,Y) and next(Y,object_6) and hand/cats/texture facts. OR
  3) wretched with ?x = object_10 if sneeze object_10 existed and appropriate other preconditions held (but sneeze object_10 is NOT in initial facts).
  4) memory cannot produce next with subject object_10 because memory requires cats ?x and we do not have cats object_10.

- From initial facts, objects Y that satisfy next(Y,object_6) are:
  - Y = object_1 (next object_1 object_6)
  - Y = object_4 (next object_4 object_6)

- To use paltry/tightfisted, we need vase(object_10, Y). Can such a vase be produced?
  - clip can produce vase(object_10, Y) only when there exists z such that next(Y, z) and next(object_10, z) both hold. Initially next(object_10, object_9) holds. So the only Y with next(Y, object_9) is Y = object_5. Thus clip can create vase(object_10, object_5) (we verify clip object_10 object_5 object_9 is applicable — see feasible action A). That gives vase(object_10,object_5).
  - But object_5 does NOT have next(object_5,object_6). It has next(object_5,object_9) initially, and wretched could change that to next(object_5,object_8) (see feasible action C). There is no available action that produces next(object_5,object_6) with the given collect/stupendous facts (wretched would require collect object_9 W and collect object_6 W with same W and stupendous W — not available).
  - Alternatively, we could attempt to create vase(object_10,object_1) or vase(object_10,object_4). To create vase(object_10,object_1) via clip we'd need sneeze object_1 (not present). To create vase(object_10,object_4) via clip we would need next(object_4, z) and next(object_10, z) with same z — current next(object_4,object_6) and next(object_10,object_9) share no z. We could try to make next(object_10,object_6) first but that is the goal.

- Another route: wretched(object_10, Y, Z, W) would add next(object_10, Z) if sneeze object_10 were true and other collects/stupendous matched; sneeze object_10 is NOT in initial facts.

Conclusion for Scenario 2:
- Several actions are individually applicable from the initial state (clip object_10 object_5 object_9; wretched on object_4; wretched on object_5; memory on object_0/object_1). However, none of these allow deriving next object_10 object_6 by themselves or in short combination under the strict no-invention rule.
- Specifically, to derive next(object_10,object_6) via paltry/tightfisted, you need vase(object_10, Y) AND next(Y,object_6) for some Y. Although clip can produce vase(object_10,object_5), object_5 does not have next(...,object_6) and no available action enables next(object_5,object_6) with the given collects/stupendous/sneeze facts.
- Therefore, with the given facts and public action schemas and WITHOUT inventing additional facts, I cannot find a complete action sequence that reaches the goal next object_10 object_6.

Missing/unknown facts that would make the goal reachable (examples — not assumed, listed so planner author can decide):
- sneeze object_10 (would allow wretched with x=object_10, perhaps enabling an applicable wretched to set next object_10 object_6 if matching collect/stupendous facts existed).
- collect object_6 W and collect object_? W with same W and stupendous W aligned such that wretched can be applied to x=object_10 to produce next object_10 object_6.
- next object_10 z for some z that matches an existing next(Y,z) with Y having next(Y,object_6) later (a common z enabling clip to create vase(object_10,Y) for Y that also leads to object_6).
- vase object_10 object_1 or vase object_10 object_4 directly in initial state (then paltry/tightfisted could be applied using next object_1 object_6 or next object_4 object_6).

Short recommended branch to attempt (if extra facts become available):
- If sneeze object_10 were true and there exists a stupendous W with collect object_6 W and collect object_<someZ> W and textures matching, then wretched object_10 object_? object_6 W might directly make next object_10 object_6.
- If vase object_10 object_1 could be created (e.g., if next object_10 some_z and next object_1 same_z existed), then paltry/tightfisted could be used to add next object_10 object_6 (since next object_1 object_6 exists).

Summary (Scenario 2)
- Feasible actions exist but the scenario's goal next object_10 object_6 is not reachable from the given facts and public action definitions without additional facts. I have enumerated feasible intermediate actions and the precise missing conditions needed to reach the goal.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
PDDL domain and problem for FastDownward
- I now provide a unified STRIPS-style domain and problem that encode both scenarios. I resolved object-name conflicts by namespacing scenario objects: object_N_s1 for Scenario 1 objects and object_N_s2 for Scenario 2 objects. Agent actions are namespaced with playerA- and playerB- prefixes to keep them distinct. The domain contains only the explicitly listed actions and uses only classical STRIPS features (typing is included).

Final notes and traceability
- The domain includes only the six action schemas provided, duplicated under playerA- and playerB- name prefixes to maintain agent/action distinction as requested.
- The Scenario 1 plan supplied by player_A was fully validated step-by-step and is achievable given the Scenario 1 initial facts; the domain/problem encode the necessary predicates and initial facts for that scenario.
- The Scenario 2 analysis (player_B) shows feasible intermediate steps but concludes the scenario goal is not reachable with the provided facts; the problem encodes Scenario 2 facts verbatim and the unreachable goal is included so FastDownward will determine (unsolvability or need for extra facts) accordingly.
- Assumptions were kept explicit at the top of the problem (no invented facts; namespacing; agent actions distinct).
- This PDDL uses only STRIPS-style constructs (no fluents, no durative actions, no conditional effects), compatible with FastDownward's classical planners.

NATURAL-PLAN sas_plan_1
------------------------------
Below is a clear, step-by-step, human-readable execution of the given PDDL plan. I list each plan step in order, assign it a timestamp (each action = 1 time unit), show the acting agent, give a short natural-language description, list the action's required preconditions (from the public action specs) and the expected effects (add / delete). For each precondition I indicate whether it is satisfied from the initial state or by a prior step (referencing the step number that produced it).

Timeline: step N executes at time t = N-1 and lasts 1 time unit.

1) Time t = 0 — Agent: player_B
   Action: playerb-clip object_10_s2 object_5_s2 object_9_s2
   Natural-language: Player B uses clip with hand object_10_s2 on sneeze object_5_s2 via texture object_9_s2 to form a vase between object_10_s2 and object_5_s2.
   Preconditions (clip): 
     - hand object_10_s2 — satisfied in initial state.
     - sneeze object_5_s2 — satisfied in initial state.
     - texture object_9_s2 — satisfied in initial state.
     - next object_5_s2 object_9_s2 — satisfied in initial state.
     - next object_10_s2 object_9_s2 — satisfied in initial state.
   Effects:
     - Add: vase object_10_s2 object_5_s2.
     - Delete: next object_10_s2 object_9_s2.

2) Time t = 1 — Agent: player_B
   Action: playerb-wretched object_5_s2 object_9_s2 object_8_s2 object_3_s2
   Natural-language: Player B applies wretched at sneeze object_5_s2 to change its next link from object_9_s2 to object_8_s2 (uses collect relations to object_3_s2).
   Preconditions (wretched):
     - sneeze object_5_s2 — satisfied in initial state.
     - texture object_9_s2 — satisfied in initial state.

NATURAL-PLAN sas_plan_3
------------------------------
Plan executed as a human-readable, step-by-step trace (each step = 1 time unit; timestamps shown as start_time → end_time):

Step 1 — t=0 → t=1
Action: clip object_10 object_5 object_9
- Preconditions checked and satisfied before execution:
  - (hand object_10) — present in initial state
  - (sneeze object_5) — present in initial state
  - (texture object_9) — present in initial state
  - (next object_5 object_9) — present in initial state
  - (next object_10 object_9) — present in initial state
- Effects applied:
  - Added: (vase object_10 object_5)
  - Deleted: (next object_10 object_9)
- Summary state change: object_10 loses its "next to object_9" relation; a vase relation between object_10 and object_5 is created.

Step 2 — t=1 → t=2
Action: wretched object_5 object_9 object_8 object_3
- Preconditions checked and satisfied at this time:
  - (sneeze object_5) — true
  - (texture object_9) and (texture object_8) — both true
  - (stupendous object_3) — true
  - (next object_5 object_9) — still true (was not removed by Step 1)
  - (collect object_9 object_3) and (collect object_8 object_3) — both present in initial state
- Effects applied:
  - Added: (next object_5 object_8)
  - Deleted: (next object_5 object_9)
- Summary state change: object_5's next relation moves from object_9 to object_8.

Step 3 — t=2 → t=3
Action: tightfisted object_10 object_5 object_8
- Preconditions checked and satisfied at this time:
  - (hand object_10) — true
  - (sneeze object_5) — true
  - (texture object_8) — true
  - (next object_5 object_8) — became true in Step 2
  - (vase object_10 object_5) — became true in Step 1
- Effects applied:
  - Added: (next object_10 object_8)
  - Deleted: (vase object_10 object_5)
- Summary state change: object_10 gains "next to object_8" and the vase relation with object_5 is removed.

Step 4 — t=3 → t=4
Action: sip object_10 object_0 object_8
- Preconditions checked and satisfied at this time:
  - (hand object_10) — true
  - (cats object_0) — true
  - (texture object_8) — true
  - (next object_10 object_8) — became true in Step 3
  - (next object_0 object_8) — present in initial state and not yet removed
- Effects applied:
  - Added: (vase object_10 object_0)
  - Deleted: (next object_10 object_8)
- Summary state change: object_10 loses "next to object_8" and now has a vase relation with object_0.

Step 5 — t=4 → t=5
Action: memory object_0 object_8 object_6
- Preconditions checked and satisfied at this time:
  - (cats object_0) — true
  - (spring object_8) and (spring object_6) — both true in initial state
  - (next object_0 object_8) — still true (not modified by prior steps)
- Effects applied:
  - Added: (next object_0 object_6)
  - Deleted: (next object_0 object_8)
- Summary state change: object_0's next relation moves from object_8 to object_6.

Step 6 — t=5 → t=6
Action: paltry object_10 object_0 object_6
- Preconditions checked and satisfied at this time:
  - (hand object_10) — true
  - (cats object_0) — true
  - (texture object_6) — true
  - (vase object_10 object_0) — became true in Step 4
  - (next object_0 object_6) — became true in Step 5
- Effects applied:
  - Added: (next object_10 object_6)
  - Deleted: (vase object_10 object_0)
- Summary state change: object_10 now has (next object_10 object_6), the specified goal relation.

Final check — t=6
- Goal (next object_10 object_6) is achieved after Step 6.
- Plan cost: 6 actions (unit cost each), matching the provided cost = 6.

Notes:
- Every step strictly follows the actions in the provided plan and all preconditions were validated against the evolving state prior to execution.
- Each action's stated effects were applied in order; no extra actions were added or removed.

My goal is to have that next object_10 object_6 and next object_9 object_6.

My plan is as follows:

[PLAN]
================================================================================


FINAL-PLAN
------------------------------
Integrated report (orchestrator)

1) Merged observed initial state (union of player1 and player2 reported facts)
- Unary predicates:
  - cats: object_0
  - hand: object_9, object_10
  - sneeze: object_3, object_4
  - spring: object_5, object_7
  - stupendous: object_1, object_2
  - texture: object_5, object_6, object_7, object_8
- Binary predicates:
  - collect: (object_5 object_1), (object_6 object_1), (object_7 object_2), (object_8 object_2)
  - next: (object_0 object_7), (object_0 object_5), (object_10 object_5), (object_3 object_5), (object_4 object_8), (object_9 object_8), (object_9 object_5)
    - Note: these come from different agent views; I keep the union (no explicit exclusivity rule given).
  - vase: none initially asserted in either agent's view

Remarks:
- There were differences between the two agents' next facts (e.g., object_0 -> object_7 vs object_0 -> object_5, object_9 -> object_8 vs object_9 -> object_5). I merged them (union) because nothing in the specification enforces uniqueness of next facts; if next is intended to be mutually exclusive, that constraint was not supplied and would need to be encoded explicitly.
- No "busy/blocked intervals" or temporal slots were provided that would mark facts unavailable; none were added to the initial state.

2) Player1's provided plan and verification (step-by-step)
Player1 plan (sequence):
  1. clip object_9 object_4 object_8
  2. wretched object_4 object_8 object_7 object_2
  3. tightfisted object_9 object_4 object_7

Action definitions used for verification (as given / observed):
- clip X Y Z
  - pre: hand X, sneeze Y, texture Z, next Y Z, next X Z
  - effect: (vase X Y) becomes true, (next X Z) becomes false
- wretched A B C D
  - pre: sneeze A, texture B, texture C, stupendous D, next A B, collect B D, collect C D
  - effect: (next A C) true, (next A B) false
- tightfisted X Y Z
  - pre: hand X, sneeze Y, texture Z, next Y Z, vase X Y
  - effect: (next X Z) true, (vase X Y) false

Check each step against the merged initial state (and cumulative effects from prior steps):

Step 1: clip object_9 object_4 object_8
- Preconditions to check:
  - hand object_9 ? -> Present (true)
  - sneeze object_4 ? -> Present (true)
  - texture object_8 ? -> Present (true)
  - next object_4 object_8 ? -> Present (true)
  - next object_9 object_8 ? -> Present (true) (player1 originally reported this; included in the union)
- Verdict: All preconditions satisfied.
- Predicted effects after execution:
  - Add: vase object_9 object_4
  - Delete: next object_9 object_8
- No missing facts required for verification.

Step 2: wretched object_4 object_8 object_7 object_2
- Preconditions to check (applied to the state after Step 1):
  - sneeze object_4 ? -> Present (true)
  - texture object_8 ? -> Present (true)
  - texture object_7 ? -> Present (true)
  - stupendous object_2 ? -> Present (true)
  - next object_4 object_8 ? -> Present (true) (was not removed by Step 1)
  - collect object_8 object_2 ? -> Present (true)
  - collect object_7 object_2 ? -> Present (true)
- Verdict: All preconditions satisfied.
- Predicted effects after execution:
  - Add: next object_4 object_7
  - Delete: next object_4 object_8
- No missing facts required for verification.

Step 3: tightfisted object_9 object_4 object_7
- Preconditions to check (applied after Steps 1 & 2):
  - hand object_9 ? -> Present (true)
  - sneeze object_4 ? -> Present (true)
  - texture object_7 ? -> Present (true)
  - next object_4 object_7 ? -> Created by Step 2 (true)
  - vase object_9 object_4 ? -> Created by Step 1 (true)
- Verdict: All preconditions satisfied (the plan's ordering supplies the needed facts).
- Predicted effects after execution:
  - Add: next object_9 object_7
  - Delete: vase object_9 object_4

Summary of Plan Verification:
- The sequence clip(object_9,object_4,object_8) -> wretched(object_4,object_8,object_7,object_2) -> tightfisted(object_9,object_4,object_7) is applicable under the merged initial facts.
- No missing facts were needed to verify applicability; all preconditions are present (either initially or as effects of earlier steps).
- The cumulative state changes after the three actions (applying effects in sequence):
  - After Step 1: +vase(object_9,object_4), -(next object_9 object_8)
  - After Step 2: +next(object_4,object_7), -(next object_4 object_8)
  - After Step 3: +next(object_9,object_7), -vase(object_9,object_4)

Potential issues / clarifications:
- The plan relies on initial fact next(object_9,object_8) — that fact was provided by player1 (present in the merged state). Player2's view did not include it, but since it is present in the union, the plan is valid. If next facts are meant to be mutually exclusive, that constraint must be made explicit; otherwise the union model is consistent with the plan.

3) Player2 goal analysis and candidate action sequences to reach the goal
Player2 goal: obtain next object_10 object_6 and next object_9 object_6.

Observations from the merged initial state relevant to achieving these goals:
- We need two facts true: next(object_10,object_6) and next(object_9,object_6).
- Actions that can create next X Z as per the public action summaries: paltry, wretched, memory, tightfisted.
- Of these, wretched creates next A C where A must be a sneeze object (object_3 or object_4). That would create next for a sneeze object; not directly target object_10/object_9 unless they are sneeze objects (they are not).
- Tightfisted and paltry create next X Z by transferring from an existing next Y Z (they require next Y Z and also require vase X Y (paltry requires vase X Y; tightfisted requires vase X Y)).
- Memory can move next X Y to next X Z where Z is a spring; memory requires cats X, spring Y, spring Z, and next X Y; we don't have spring object_6, so memory can't directly create next ...6 unless spring object_6 exists (it doesn't).
- Therefore a feasible general pattern is:
  - First create a next Y object_6 for some Y (where Y could be a sneeze object, since wretched can produce next for sneeze objects).
  - Then use tightfisted or paltry to transfer next Y object_6 into next object_10 object_6 and next object_9 object_6, by first creating vase object_10 Y and vase object_9 Y respectively.

Concrete working candidate sequence (uses only facts present in the merged initial state and uses only available actions):
- Choose Y = object_3 (sneeze object), Z = object_6 (texture object_6). D = object_1 (stupendous)
  1. clip object_10 object_3 object_5
     - Preconditions: hand object_10 (true), sneeze object_3 (true), texture object_5 (true), next object_3 object_5 (true), next object_10 object_5 (true)
     - Effect: +vase(object_10,object_3), -(next object_10 object_5)
  2. clip object_9 object_3 object_5
     - Preconditions: hand object_9 (true), sneeze object_3 (true), texture object_5 (true), next object_3 object_5 (true), next object_9 object_5 (true)
     - Effect: +vase(object_9,object_3), -(next object_9 object_5)
     - Note: both clips require next object_3 object_5; clip does not delete next object_3 object_5 (it deletes next X Z where X is the hand object), so both clips can be performed while next object_3 object_5 remains.
  3. wretched object_3 object_5 object_6 object_1
     - Preconditions: sneeze object_3 (true), texture object_5 (true), texture object_6 (true), stupendous object_1 (true), next object_3 object_5 (true), collect object_5 object_1 (true), collect object_6 object_1 (true)
     - Effect: +next(object_3,object_6), -(next(object_3,object_5))
  4. tightfisted object_10 object_3 object_6
     - Preconditions: hand object_10 (true), sneeze object_3 (true), texture object_6 (true), next object_3 object_6 (created by step 3), vase object_10 object_3 (created by step 1)
     - Effect: +next(object_10,object_6), -(vase object_10 object_3)
  5. tightfisted object_9 object_3 object_6
     - Preconditions: hand object_9 (true), sneeze object_3 (true), texture object_6 (true), next object_3 object_6 (present after step 3), vase object_9 object_3 (created by step 2)
     - Effect: +next(object_9,object_6), -(vase object_9 object_3)

Check of preconditions and interactions:
- Steps 1 & 2 (clips) both require next(object_3,object_5) and consume next(object_10,object_5)/next(object_9,object_5) (they delete next X Z where X is the hand object), but they do not delete next(object_3,object_5). So steps 1 & 2 must occur before step 3.
- Step 3 (wretched) produces next(object_3,object_6) required for steps 4 & 5, and deletes next(object_3,object_5).
- Steps 4 & 5 (tightfisted) require vase facts produced in steps 1 & 2 and the newly created next(object_3,object_6). They yield the targeted next(object_10,object_6) and next(object_9,object_6).
- All required collects and stupendous facts for wretched are present in the merged initial state.
- No missing facts were needed beyond the merged union; the sequence is executable under the merged state.

Alternate choices:
- Using object_4 as the sneeze object (sneeze object_4) might also work if matching next/object/collect patterns exist; I selected object_3 because it had next object_3 object_5 and both object_10 and object_9 had next to object_5 initially (convenient for clip).

Unresolved / ambiguous items that would need clarification if different constraints were intended:
- If next(...) is intended to be a unique (functional) relation (each object has at most one "next" target), then the union of both agents' next facts could be inconsistent; in that case, we must be given which agent's view is authoritative or an explicit exclusivity constraint to resolve conflicts.
- If temporal constraints or "busy/blocked intervals" exist (agents mentioned preferences/earliest), they were not provided as explicit time windows to encode; no temporal constraints were modeled here beyond strict ordering in sequences.

4) Final PDDL domain and problem for Fast Downward
- The domain encodes the predicates and the six actions (paltry, sip, clip, wretched, memory, tightfisted) with the preconditions and effects exactly as in the shared public information. The problem encodes the merged initial state (union of both agents' reported facts) and the goals requested by player2: next object_10 object_6 and next object_9 object_6.
- This PDDL uses only classical STRIPS constructs and negative effects (no fluents, durative actions, axioms, or conditional effects), suitable for Fast Downward.

End of integrated report.

If you want, I can:
- produce an explicit action plan (sequence of actions) to achieve player2's two goals (I already suggested one concrete sequence above),
- or modify the problem initial state to enforce uniqueness of next(...) if that semantic is required.

NATURAL-PLAN sas_plan_0
------------------------------
Summary of the relevant initial facts (as used to verify the plan)
- Hands: hand(object_9), hand(object_10)
- Sneezes: sneeze(object_3), sneeze(object_4)
- Textures: texture(object_5), texture(object_6), texture(object_7), texture(object_8)
- Stupendous: stupendous(object_1), stupendous(object_2)
- Collect relations: collect(object_5, object_1), collect(object_6, object_1), collect(object_7, object_2), collect(object_8, object_2)
- Next relations: next(object_0,object_7), next(object_0,object_5), next(object_10,object_5), next(object_3,object_5), next(object_4,object_8), next(object_9,object_8), next(object_9,object_5)
- No vase facts present initially.

All preconditions referenced below are taken from the provided action signatures in the domain/public information.

Plan (5 steps). Each step shown with a timestamp (assume unit time per step), preconditions checked, effects applied, and any missing facts noted.

Step 1 — time t=0s
Action: clip object_9 object_3 object_5
- Formal: clip(X=object_9, Y=object_3, Z=object_5)
- Preconditions required: hand(object_9), sneeze(object_3), texture(object_5), next(object_3,object_5), next(object_9,object_5)
- Are they satisfied in the initial state? Yes — all are present.
- Effects (applied): add vase(object_9,object_3); delete next(object_9,object_5)
- Resulting local changes after Step 1:
  - Added: (vase object_9 object_3)
  - Removed: (next object_9 object_5)
- Missing facts needed to verify applicability: none (all preconditions present).

Step 2 — time t=1s
Action: clip object_10 object_3 object_5
- Formal: clip(X=object_10, Y=object_3, Z=object_5)
- Preconditions required: hand(object_10), sneeze(object_3), texture(object_5), next(object_3,object_5), next(object_10,object_5)
- Are they satisfied? Yes — all are present at this point (note next(object_3,object_5) was not removed by Step 1).
- Effects (applied): add vase(object_10,object_3); delete next(object_10,object_5)
- Resulting local changes after Step 2:
  - Added: (vase object_10 object_3)
  - Removed: (next object_10 object_5)
- Missing facts needed to verify applicability: none.

Step 3 — time t=2s
Action: wretched object_3 object_5 object_6 object_1
- Formal: wretched(A=object_3, B=object_5, C=object_6, D=object_1)
- Preconditions required: sneeze(object_3), texture(object_5), texture(object_6), stupendous(object_1), next(object_3,object_5), collect(object_5,object_1), collect(object_6,object_1)
- Are they satisfied? Yes — all preconditions are present. (next(object_3,object_5) remained until this step.)
- Effects (applied): add next(object_3,object_6); delete next(object_3,object_5)
- Resulting local changes after Step 3:
  - Added: (next object_3 object_6)
  - Removed: (next object_3 object_5)
- Missing facts needed to verify applicability: none.

Step 4 — time t=3s
Action: tightfisted object_9 object_3 object_6
- Formal: tightfisted(X=object_9, Y=object_3, Z=object_6)
- Preconditions required: hand(object_9), sneeze(object_3), texture(object_6), next(object_3,object_6), vase(object_9,object_3)
- Are they satisfied? Yes —
  - hand(object_9) was true initially,
  - sneeze(object_3) true,
  - texture(object_6) true,
  - next(object_3,object_6) was added by Step 3,
  - vase(object_9,object_3) was added by Step 1.
- Effects (applied): add next(object_9,object_6); delete vase(object_9,object_3)
- Resulting local changes after Step 4:
  - Added: (next object_9 object_6)
  - Removed: (vase object_9 object_3)
- Missing facts needed to verify applicability: none.

Step 5 — time t=4s
Action: tightfisted object_10 object_3 object_6
- Formal: tightfisted(X=object_10, Y=object_3, Z=object_6)
- Preconditions required: hand(object_10), sneeze(object_3), texture(object_6), next(object_3,object_6), vase(object_10,object_3)
- Are they satisfied? Yes —
  - hand(object_10) was true initially,
  - sneeze(object_3) true,
  - texture(object_6) true,
  - next(object_3,object_6) exists (from Step 3),
  - vase(object_10,object_3) exists (from Step 2).
- Effects (applied): add next(object_10,object_6); delete vase(object_10,object_3)
- Resulting local changes after Step 5:
  - Added: (next object_10 object_6)
  - Removed: (vase object_10 object_3)
- Missing facts needed to verify applicability: none.

Final state relevant to the goal (after all steps)
- next(object_10,object_6) — achieved in Step 5
- next(object_9,object_6) — achieved in Step 4
- Therefore the goal (next object_10 object_6) AND (next object_9 object_6) is satisfied.

Overall verification notes
- Every action in the provided plan is applicable when executed in the given order: all preconditions for each action are present at the moment the action is executed.
- No additional facts were required or missing to verify applicability of any action.
- The specified effects of each action produce the two goal facts by the end of the sequence.
- Actions are STRIPS-style instantaneous steps; timestamps above are illustrative (1 unit per step) to show order and timing.

This sequence reproduces the provided plan exactly and confirms it is compliant with the domain, the problem initial state, and achieves the stated goal.

I am playing with a set of objects. Here are the actions I can do

Paltry object_0 object_1 object_2.
Sip object_0 object_1 object_2.
Clip object_0 object_1 object_2.
Wretched object_0 object_1 object_2 object_3.
Memory object_0 object_1 object_2.
Tightfisted object_0 object_1 object_2.

I have the following restrictions on my actions:
To perform paltry action, the following facts need to be true: hand object_0, cats object_1, texture object_2, vase object_0 object_1, and next object_1 object_2
Once paltry is performed the following facts will be true: next object_0 object_2
Once paltry is performed the following facts will be false: vase object_0 object_1
To perform sip action, the following facts need to be true: hand object_0, cats object_1, texture object_2, next object_0 object_2, and next object_1 object_2
Once sip is performed the following facts will be true: vase object_0 object_1
Once sip is performed the following facts will be false: next object_0 object_2
To perform clip action, the following facts need to be true: hand object_0, sneeze object_1, texture object_2, next object_1 object_2, and next object_0 object_2
Once clip is performed the following facts will be true: vase object_0 object_1

To perform wretched action, the following facts need to be true: sneeze object_0, texture object_1, texture object_2, stupendous object_3, next object_0 object_1, collect object_1 object_3, and collect object_2 object_3
Once wretched is performed the following facts will be true: next object_0 object_2
Once wretched is performed the following facts will be false: next object_0 object_1
To perform memory action, the following facts need to be true: cats object_0, spring object_1, spring object_2, and next object_0 object_1
Once memory is performed the following facts will be true: next object_0 object_2
Once memory is performed the following facts will be false: next object_0 object_1
To perform tightfisted action, the following facts need to be true: hand object_0, sneeze object_1, texture object_2, next object_1 object_2, and vase object_0 object_1
Once tightfisted is performed the following facts will be true: next object_0 object_2

NATURAL-PLAN sas_plan_5
------------------------------
Summary of initial relevant facts (t = 0s):
- Objects present: object_0 … object_11.
- Relevant predicates true initially:
  - hand: object_9, object_10
  - sneeze: object_3, object_4
  - texture: object_5, object_6, object_7, object_8
  - next: (object_0 → object_5), (object_10 → object_5), (object_3 → object_5), (object_4 → object_8), (object_9 → object_5)
  - collect: (object_5 → object_1), (object_6 → object_1), (object_7 → object_2), (object_8 → object_2)
  - stupendous: object_1, object_2
- Goal to reach: next object_10 object_6 and next object_9 object_6.

Plan (followed exactly as given). Each step shows a timestamp, duration (assumed 1s per action), required preconditions and whether they hold, effects applied, and the relevant resulting predicates after the step.

Step 1 — t = 0s, duration 1s
Action: clip object_9 object_3 object_5
- Formal preconditions (clip ?a ?b ?c): hand ?a, sneeze ?b, texture ?c, next ?b ?c, next ?a ?c.
- Checked for parameters (object_9, object_3, object_5):
  - hand object_9: true
  - sneeze object_3: true
  - texture object_5: true
  - next object_3 object_5: true
  - next object_9 object_5: true
- All preconditions satisfied → action applicable.
- Effects applied:
  - Add: vase object_9 object_3
  - Delete: next object_9 object_5
- Relevant state after step 1:
  - next no longer includes (object_9 → object_5)
  - vase includes (object_9, object_3)
  - next still includes (object_10 → object_5) and (object_3 → object_5)

Step 2 — t = 1s, duration 1s
Action: clip object_10 object_3 object_5
- Preconditions (clip ?a ?b ?c) for (object_10, object_3, object_5):
  - hand object_10: true
  - sneeze object_3: true
  - texture object_5: true
  - next object_3 object_5: true (still true after step 1)
  - next object_10 object_5: true
- All preconditions satisfied → action applicable.
- Effects applied:
  - Add: vase object_10 object_3
  - Delete: next object_10 object_5
- Relevant state after step 2:
  - next no longer includes (object_10 → object_5)
  - vase includes (object_10, object_3) and (object_9, object_3)
  - next still includes (object_3 → object_5) (note this will be modified next)

Step 3 — t = 2s, duration 1s
Action: wretched object_3 object_5 object_6 object_1
- Preconditions (wretched ?a ?b ?c ?d): sneeze ?a, texture ?b, texture ?c, stupendous ?d, next ?a ?b, collect ?b ?d, collect ?c ?d.
- For (object_3, object_5, object_6, object_1):
  - sneeze object_3: true
  - texture object_5: true
  - texture object_6: true
  - stupendous object_1: true
  - next object_3 object_5: true (present before this step)
  - collect object_5 object_1: true
  - collect object_6 object_1: true
- All preconditions satisfied → action applicable.
- Effects applied:
  - Add: next object_3 object_6
  - Delete: next object_3 object_5
- Relevant state after step 3:
  - next now includes (object_3 → object_6)
  - next no longer includes (object_3 → object_5)
  - previously deleted next facts for object_9 and object_10 → object_5 remain deleted

Step 4 — t = 3s, duration 1s
Action: tightfisted object_9 object_3 object_6
- Preconditions (tightfisted ?a ?b ?c): hand ?a, sneeze ?b, texture ?c, next ?b ?c, vase ?a ?b.
- For (object_9, object_3, object_6):
  - hand object_9: true
  - sneeze object_3: true
  - texture object_6: true
  - next object_3 object_6: true (added in step 3)
  - vase object_9 object_3: true (added in step 1)
- All preconditions satisfied → action applicable.
- Effects applied:
  - Add: next object_9 object_6
  - Delete: vase object_9 object_3
- Relevant state after step 4:
  - next now includes (object_9 → object_6)
  - vase no longer includes (object_9, object_3) but still includes (object_10, object_3)

Step 5 — t = 4s, duration 1s
Action: tightfisted object_10 object_3 object_6
- Preconditions (tightfisted ?a ?b ?c) for (object_10, object_3, object_6):
  - hand object_10: true
  - sneeze object_3: true
  - texture object_6: true
  - next object_3 object_6: true (from step 3)
  - vase object_10 object_3: true (added in step 2)
- All preconditions satisfied → action applicable.
- Effects applied:
  - Add: next object_10 object_6
  - Delete: vase object_10 object_3
- Relevant state after step 5:
  - next now includes (object_10 → object_6)
  - vase no longer includes (object_10, object_3)
  - next includes both (object_9 → object_6) and (object_10 → object_6)

Final assessment — t = 5s
- Goal checked: next object_10 object_6 and next object_9 object_6
- Both are true after step 5.
- Conclusion: The provided plan (the five actions listed, executed in the given order) is applicable at each step under the domain definitions and initial facts, and it successfully achieves the goal. Total plan duration (as reported here): 5s (1s per action, timestamps from 0s to 5s).

FINAL-PLAN
------------------------------
I can do that, but I don’t yet have the two analyses you referenced (analysis_player1 and analysis_player2). I need those inputs to merge names, initial facts, constraints and goals into a single PDDL domain + problem. Please paste the contents of analysis_player1 and analysis_player2 (the descriptive summaries from the two player agents).

To make sure I generate exactly what you need, please include in each analysis (or confirm the following if already present):

- Objects and types (or a short list of entity names and their types). If names differ between analyses for the same entity, indicate intended equivalences (or I will ask follow-up questions).
- Initial facts / state assertions (which objects have which properties initially).
- Goals (one or more goals; if multi-agent, tell me whether goals are conjunctive or per-agent).
- Action descriptions (if provided): for each action the player used or assumed, give its name, parameters, preconditions, and effects. If an action is only hypothesised, label it so.
- Time / availability constraints or preferences (e.g., “slot X unavailable at time t” or “prefer earliest start”): because you asked me to treat preferences as hard temporal constraints, specify exact earliest/latest times or unavailable intervals.
- Any predicates or typed relations you expect (e.g., at, holding, charged, free-slot).
- If there are naming mismatches across analyses, point them out (e.g., analysis_player1 calls an object kettle1 while analysis_player2 calls it kettle-A) or let me know if you want me to assume names map by string similarity.

Notes on what I will produce once I have those two analyses:
- A FastDownward-compatible PDDL domain enclosed in <domain>...</domain>, using the public action model with the action names you requested: paltry, sip, clip, wretched, memory, tightfisted (I will keep those actions distinct; if both analyses used the same action name with different semantics I will keep both as separate actions with disambiguated parameter names and document the mapping).
- The domain will include typed predicates and the actions’ preconditions/effects exactly as derivable from the analyses (I will not invent extra capabilities).
- A FastDownward-compatible PDDL problem enclosed in <problem>...</problem> with a clear :objects section, :init section, and :goal section. Temporal constraints expressed as hard constraints will be encoded as fluent predicates or numeric time resources depending on the input you give; if you require full PDDL2.1 durative actions, indicate that explicitly — otherwise I will encode time using integer/time-step fluents compatible with FastDownward’s standard (non-temporal) capabilities by modelling discrete time steps as objects and constraints as facts (or I can use simple numeric fluents if you request ADL + numeric support).
- If there are any unavailable slots, I will ensure they are not marked free in the initial state and treat “earliest time” requirements as strict lower bounds on actions (encoded per your guidance).

If you prefer, paste the two analyses now and I will immediately produce the merged PDDL domain and problem. If you want me to assume defaults for missing details (e.g., simple unary predicates, no numeric fluents, earliest time = step 0) tell me which defaults to use.

NATURAL-PLAN sas_plan_1
------------------------------
Sequence of human-readable actions (matches the given plan exactly). Each step shows a timestamp (1.0 time unit per step), the action with its arguments, the formal preconditions (from the public model), whether they are satisfied at execution time, and the action effects (what it adds and deletes). The state is simulated incrementally so precondition checks are accurate.

Initial relevant facts (merged initial state highlights)
- hand: object_10, object_11, object_9
- cats: object_0, object_1
- texture: object_5, object_6, object_7, object_8, object_9
- sneeze: object_3, object_4, object_5
- spring: object_5, object_6, object_7, object_8
- stupendous: object_1, object_2, object_3
- collect: (6,2), (7,2), (8,3), (9,3), (5,1), (6,1), (8,2)
- next (initial): (0,8), (1,6), (10,6), (11,9), (4,6), (5,8), (0,5), (10,8), (11,6), (3,5), (4,7), (9,5)

Plan steps

1) Step 1 — time 0.0 → 1.0
Action: clip(object_10, object_4, object_6)
Preconditions (clip): hand(object_10), sneeze(object_4), texture(object_6), next(object_4,object_6), next(object_10,object_6)
Status: All preconditions satisfied (all true in the current state).
Effects:

State change summary: next(10,6) removed; vase(10,4) added.

2) Step 2 — time 1.0 → 2.0
Action: tightfisted(object_10, object_4, object_7)
Preconditions (tightfisted): hand(object_10), sneeze(object_4), texture(object_7), next(object_4,object_7), vase(object_10,object_4)
Status: All preconditions satisfied (vase(10,4) was added in Step 1 and next(4,7) exists initially).
Effects:

3) Step 3 — time 2.0 → 3.0
Action: sip(object_9, object_0, object_5)
Preconditions (sip): hand(object_9), cats(object_0), texture(object_5), next(object_9,object_5), next(object_0,object_5)
Status: All preconditions satisfied (next(9,5) and next(0,5) present initially).
Effects:

- Deletes: next(object_9, object_5)
State change summary: next(9,5) removed; vase(9,0) added.

4) Step 4 — time 3.0 → 4.0
Action: memory(object_0, object_5, object_7)
Preconditions (memory): cats(object_0), spring(object_5), spring(object_7), next(object_0,object_5)
Status: All preconditions satisfied (next(0,5) remained until now).
Effects:
- Adds: next(object_0, object_7)
- Deletes: next(object_0, object_5)
State change summary: next(0,7) added; next(0,5) removed.

5) Step 5 — time 4.0 → 5.0
Action: paltry(object_9, object_0, object_7)
Preconditions (paltry): hand(object_9), cats(object_0), texture(object_7), vase(object_9,object_0), next(object_0,object_7)
Status: All preconditions satisfied (vase(9,0) added in Step 3; next(0,7) added in Step 4).
Effects:
- Adds: next(object_9, object_7)
- Deletes: vase(object_9, object_0)
State change summary: next(9,7) added (this achieves goal next object_9 object_7); vase(9,0) removed.

6) Step 6 — time 5.0 → 6.0
Action: clip(object_11, object_4, object_6)
Preconditions (clip): hand(object_11), sneeze(object_4), texture(object_6), next(object_4,object_6), next(object_11,object_6)
Status: All preconditions satisfied (next(4,6) and next(11,6) existed initially; hand/sneeze/texture are present).
Effects:
- Adds: vase(object_11, object_4)
- Deletes: next(object_11, object_6)
State change summary: next(11,6) removed; vase(11,4) added.

7) Step 7 — time 6.0 → 7.0
Action: tightfisted(object_11, object_4, object_7)
Preconditions (tightfisted): hand(object_11), sneeze(object_4), texture(object_7), next(object_4,object_7), vase(object_11,object_4)
Status: All preconditions satisfied (vase(11,4) added in Step 6; next(4,7) present initially).
Effects:
- Adds: next(object_11, object_7)
- Deletes: vase(object_11, object_4)
State change summary: next(11,7) added (this achieves goal next object_11 object_7); vase(11,4) removed.

8) Step 8 — time 7.0 → 8.0
Action: wretched(object_5, object_8, object_9, object_3)
Preconditions (wretched): sneeze(object_5), texture(object_8), texture(object_9), stupendous(object_3), next(object_5,object_8), collect(object_8,object_3), collect(object_9,object_3)
Status: All preconditions satisfied (next(5,8) and collect facts are in the initial state; sneeze/texture/stupendous facts present).
Effects:
- Adds: next(object_5, object_9)
- Deletes: next(object_5, object_8)
State change summary: next(5,9) added; next(5,8) removed.

9) Step 9 — time 8.0 → 9.0
Action: clip(object_11, object_5, object_9)
Preconditions (clip): hand(object_11), sneeze(object_5), texture(object_9), next(object_5,object_9), next(object_11,object_9)
Status: All preconditions satisfied (next(5,9) was just added in Step 8; next(11,9) was present initially and not deleted until now).
Effects:
- Adds: vase(object_11, object_5)
- Deletes: next(object_11, object_9)
State change summary: vase(11,5) added; next(11,9) removed.

10) Step 10 — time 9.0 → 10.0
Action: wretched(object_5, object_9, object_8, object_3)
Preconditions (wretched): sneeze(object_5), texture(object_9), texture(object_8), stupendous(object_3), next(object_5,object_9), collect(object_9,object_3), collect(object_8,object_3)
Status: All preconditions satisfied (next(5,9) still present; collect facts present).
Effects:
- Adds: next(object_5, object_8)
- Deletes: next(object_5, object_9)
State change summary: next(5,8) restored; next(5,9) removed.

11) Step 11 — time 10.0 → 11.0
Action: tightfisted(object_11, object_5, object_8)
Preconditions (tightfisted): hand(object_11), sneeze(object_5), texture(object_8), next(object_5,object_8), vase(object_11,object_5)
Status: All preconditions satisfied (next(5,8) re-added in Step 10; vase(11,5) was added in Step 9).
Effects:
- Adds: next(object_11, object_8)
- Deletes: vase(object_11, object_5)
State change summary: next(11,8) added (this achieves goal next object_11 object_8); vase(11,5) removed.

Final verification (after Step 11)
- next(object_10, object_7): added in Step 2 — present
- next(object_11, object_8): added in Step 11 — present
- next(object_11, object_7): added in Step 7 — present
- next(object_9, object_7): added in Step 5 — present

All four goal facts are true in the final state. Every action in the provided plan was executed in order; at each step the public-model preconditions were satisfied by the state at that time, and the effects were applied as described above.

Notes
- Each step used 1.0 time unit in this presentation; timestamps are shown as start → end for readability (you can rescale durations if you prefer different timing).
- No steps were added or removed; the sequence matches the provided plan exactly.

PROBLEM
------------------------------
I am playing with a set of objects. Here are the actions I can do

Paltry object_0 object_1 object_2.
Sip object_0 object_1 object_2.
Clip object_0 object_1 object_2.
Wretched object_0 object_1 object_2 object_3.
Memory object_0 object_1 object_2.
Tightfisted object_0 object_1 object_2.

I have the following restrictions on my actions:
To perform paltry action, the following facts need to be true: hand object_0, cats object_1, texture object_2, vase object_0 object_1, and next object_1 object_2

FINAL-PLAN
------------------------------
I can produce the FastDownwards-compatible PDDL domain and problem files, but I don’t yet have the analysis outputs you referenced. I must not invent availability or constraints beyond what those analyst reports contain, so I need the analysts’ reports (the “public action schemas” and the scenario/initial-state details) before I can synthesize a correct model.

Please provide the following items (copy/paste the analyst outputs or confirm their contents). If any item is missing, identify which analysts’ report is absent and whether you want me to make conservative assumptions.

1) Public action schemas (authoritative templates)
   - For each action: name, parameter list with types, precondition formula, effect formula.
   - Any durative/temporal aspects (start/end/over all) or whether we must encode as instantaneous STRIPS actions.

2) Objects and types
   - Complete list of object instances and their types (agents, locations, resources, tasks, time-slots, etc.)
   - Any type hierarchy.

3) Initial state(s)
   - Ground predicates that are true in the initial state.
   - Resource quantities (if numeric fluents) or resource availability predicates.
   - Any time windows or unavailable slots to be enforced as hard constraints.

4) Goal conditions
   - Conjunction (and any conjunction-of-conjunctions) of ground predicates or universally-quantified formulas that must hold.
   - If multiple goals/scenarios exist, indicate which to use or whether to merge.

5) Constraints & preferences (to be encoded as hard constraints per your instruction)
   - For any natural-language preferences (e.g., “avoid X”, “would rather do A before B”, “earliest time”), confirm they should be treated as hard constraints and show how to convert them to predicates/times.
   - Any mutual exclusions, ordering constraints, capacity limits.

6) Reconciliation instructions (if different analysts used different names)
   - If analysts used different predicate/action/object names for the same conceptual entity, provide mapping or indicate I should choose one canonical name and list mappings to document in the top-of-file comments.

7) Choice of temporal encoding
   - FastDownwards supports only classical (STRIPS/ADL) and some numeric fluents; if analysts rely on durative actions, indicate whether to:
     a) Encode time explicitly using time-step objects and actions, or
     b) Use ADL/durative-actions (only if you confirm FastDownwards build supports PDDL2.1 durative actions in your environment).

8) Any solver-specific limitations to respect
   - e.g., avoid negative preconditions, only use ADL? (I will follow standard FastDownwards-compatible PDDL: typed, no advanced temporal features unless you confirm.)

If you want me to proceed with reasonable conservative assumptions instead of waiting for the reports, state which of the following I should assume (I’ll keep assumptions documented in comments at the top of each PDDL file):
   - Use STRIPS-style actions (no durative actions).
   - All time preferences become ordering constraints (action A must occur before B).
   - Use a single merged scenario: include all objects mentioned by analysts and initial facts as union, with unavailable slots set to false.
   - Canonical naming: I will choose predicate and action names derived from the “public action schemas” you provide; where multiple names exist I will pick one and list the mapping.

If you prefer, paste the analysts’ outputs here and I will immediately produce:
   - A PDDL domain file enclosed between <domain></domain> tags, with a short top-of-file comment describing reconciliations/assumptions.
   - A PDDL problem file enclosed between <problem></problem> tags, using the scenario you specify (or a merged scenario if requested), and a similar short comment.

Example of the comment block I will add at the top of each file (I’ll fill with real reconciliations once I get the reports):
   ;;; Reconciliations and assumptions:
   ;;; - Chose canonical predicate names: (at ?a ?l), (has ?agent ?res) — mapping: analystA (loc) -> at, analystB (position) -> at
   ;;; - Time windows treated as ordering constraints encoded by binary predicates (available-slot ?t)
   ;;; - All preferences treated as hard constraints per your instruction.
   ;;; - Using STRIPS/typed PDDL compatible with FastDownwards (no durative actions).

Send the analysts’ analysis outputs (or authorize the conservative assumptions) and I’ll generate the domain + problem files.

NATURAL-PLAN sas_plan_1
------------------------------
Summary: the following is a step-by-step, human-readable execution trace of the given plan applied to the provided initial state. Each step lists a timestamp (start time in arbitrary units), an assumed duration (1.0 unit each), the grounded action, the precondition check (which required facts were present), the effects (facts added and facts deleted), and the immediate resulting relevant changes. All preconditions were satisfied at the time of application. The final goal (next object_10 object_7, next object_11 object_7, next object_9 object_7) is achieved at the end.

Initial relevant facts (before step 1, from the problem):
- cats object_0
- collect object_5 object_1
- collect object_6 object_1
- collect object_7 object_2
- collect object_8 object_2
- hand object_10, hand object_11, hand object_9
- next object_0 object_5
- next object_10 object_8
- next object_11 object_6
- next object_3 object_5
- next object_4 object_7
- next object_9 object_5
- sneeze object_3, sneeze object_4
- spring object_5, spring object_7
- stupendous object_1, stupendous object_2
- texture object_5, texture object_6, texture object_7, texture object_8

Execution trace (each action duration = 1.0 time unit):

1) Time 0.0 → 1.0 : sip(object_9, object_0, object_5)
- Preconditions checked (all present): hand object_9; cats object_0; texture object_5; next object_9 object_5; next object_0 object_5.
- Effects:
  - Added: vase object_9 object_0
  - Deleted: next object_9 object_5
- Resulting immediate change: object_9 now holds vase(object_9,object_0); object_9 is no longer linked to object_5.

2) Time 1.0 → 2.0 : wretched(object_3, object_5, object_6, object_1)
- Preconditions checked (all present): sneeze object_3; texture object_5; texture object_6; stupendous object_1; next object_3 object_5; collect object_5 object_1; collect object_6 object_1.
- Effects:
  - Added: next object_3 object_6
  - Deleted: next object_3 object_5
- Resulting immediate change: object_3's next changes from object_5 to object_6.

3) Time 2.0 → 3.0 : clip(object_11, object_3, object_6)
- Preconditions checked (all present): hand object_11; sneeze object_3; texture object_6; next object_3 object_6; next object_11 object_6.
- Effects:
  - Added: vase object_11 object_3
  - Deleted: next object_11 object_6
- Resulting immediate change: vase(object_11,object_3) created; object_11 is no longer linked to object_6.

4) Time 3.0 → 4.0 : wretched(object_3, object_6, object_5, object_1)
- Preconditions checked (all present): sneeze object_3; texture object_6; texture object_5; stupendous object_1; next object_3 object_6; collect object_6 object_1; collect object_5 object_1.
- Effects:
  - Added: next object_3 object_5
  - Deleted: next object_3 object_6
- Resulting immediate change: object_3's next switches back from object_6 to object_5.

5) Time 4.0 → 5.0 : tightfisted(object_11, object_3, object_5)
- Preconditions checked (all present): hand object_11; sneeze object_3; texture object_5; next object_3 object_5; vase object_11 object_3.
- Effects:
  - Added: next object_11 object_5
  - Deleted: vase object_11 object_3
- Resulting immediate change: vase(object_11,object_3) removed; object_11 now linked to object_5.

6) Time 5.0 → 6.0 : sip(object_11, object_0, object_5)
- Preconditions checked (all present): hand object_11; cats object_0; texture object_5; next object_11 object_5; next object_0 object_5.
- Effects:
  - Added: vase object_11 object_0
  - Deleted: next object_11 object_5
- Resulting immediate change: vase(object_11,object_0) created; object_11 is no longer linked to object_5.

7) Time 6.0 → 7.0 : memory(object_0, object_5, object_7)
- Preconditions checked (all present): cats object_0; spring object_5; spring object_7; next object_0 object_5.
- Effects:
  - Added: next object_0 object_7
  - Deleted: next object_0 object_5
- Resulting immediate change: object_0 is now linked to object_7 (next object_0 object_7); the prior link to object_5 is removed.

8) Time 7.0 → 8.0 : paltry(object_9, object_0, object_7)
- Preconditions checked (all present): hand object_9; cats object_0; texture object_7; vase object_9 object_0; next object_0 object_7.
- Effects:
  - Added: next object_9 object_7
  - Deleted: vase object_9 object_0
- Resulting immediate change: object_9 now linked to object_7 (goal-related); vase(object_9,object_0) removed.

9) Time 8.0 → 9.0 : paltry(object_11, object_0, object_7)
- Preconditions checked (all present): hand object_11; cats object_0; texture object_7; vase object_11 object_0; next object_0 object_7.
- Effects:
  - Added: next object_11 object_7
  - Deleted: vase object_11 object_0
- Resulting immediate change: object_11 now linked to object_7 (goal-related); vase(object_11,object_0) removed.

10) Time 9.0 → 10.0 : wretched(object_4, object_7, object_8, object_2)
- Preconditions checked (all present): sneeze object_4; texture object_7; texture object_8; stupendous object_2; next object_4 object_7; collect object_7 object_2; collect object_8 object_2.
- Effects:
  - Added: next object_4 object_8
  - Deleted: next object_4 object_7
- Resulting immediate change: object_4's next switches from object_7 to object_8.

11) Time 10.0 → 11.0 : clip(object_10, object_4, object_8)
- Preconditions checked (all present): hand object_10; sneeze object_4; texture object_8; next object_4 object_8; next object_10 object_8.
- Effects:
  - Added: vase object_10 object_4
  - Deleted: next object_10 object_8
- Resulting immediate change: vase(object_10,object_4) created; object_10 is no longer linked to object_8.

12) Time 11.0 → 12.0 : wretched(object_4, object_8, object_7, object_2)
- Preconditions checked (all present): sneeze object_4; texture object_8; texture object_7; stupendous object_2; next object_4 object_8; collect object_8 object_2; collect object_7 object_2.
- Effects:
  - Added: next object_4 object_7
  - Deleted: next object_4 object_8
- Resulting immediate change: object_4's next switches back to object_7.

13) Time 12.0 → 13.0 : tightfisted(object_10, object_4, object_7)
- Preconditions checked (all present): hand object_10; sneeze object_4; texture object_7; next object_4 object_7; vase object_10 object_4.
- Effects:
  - Added: next object_10 object_7
  - Deleted: vase object_10 object_4
- Resulting immediate change: object_10 now linked to object_7 (goal-related); vase(object_10,object_4) removed.

Final relevant state (after step 13):
- next object_10 object_7 (added at step 13)
- next object_11 object_7 (added at step 9)
- next object_9 object_7 (added at step 8)
=> The goal (next object_10 object_7 AND next object_11 object_7 AND next object_9 object_7) is satisfied.

Notes/assumptions:
- Each action was executed sequentially; I reported a simple uniform duration of 1.0 time unit per action and timestamps as cumulative start times.
- All preconditions used in checks were present in the initial state or were produced by earlier steps in the plan; no missing information was required.
- I reported only the directly relevant facts added/deleted by each action (vase and next facts and the predicates required in preconditions) rather than dumping the entire state each step. If you want the full complete state after each step (all predicates), I can provide that as well.
