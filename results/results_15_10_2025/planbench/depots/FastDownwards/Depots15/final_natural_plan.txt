Executed plan (1 step)

Step 1
- Time: start t = 0.0 s, duration = 1.0 s, end t = 1.0 s
- Action: paltry
- Parameters:
  - OBJ0 = object_0
  - OBJ1 = object_1
  - OBJ2 = object_2
- Required preconditions (checked before execution):
  - (hand object_0)         — actor holds object_0
  - (cats object_1)         — object_1 has predicate cats
  - (texture object_2)      — object_2 has predicate texture
  - (vase object_0 object_1) — vase relation between object_0 and object_1
  - (next object_1 object_2) — next relation from object_1 to object_2
  These preconditions are satisfied by the initial state.
- Effects (applied at end of action):
  - Positive effect (added): (next object_0 object_2)
  - Negative effect (removed): (vase object_0 object_1)
- Cost: 1 (unit cost)

Resulting facts after Step 1 (relevant subset)
- (hand object_0)
- (cats object_1)
- (texture object_2)
- (next object_1 object_2)    (unchanged)
- (next object_0 object_2)    (newly achieved)
- (vase object_0 object_1)    (removed)

Goal check
- Goal: (next object_0 object_2)
- Status: achieved after Step 1

End of plan.
