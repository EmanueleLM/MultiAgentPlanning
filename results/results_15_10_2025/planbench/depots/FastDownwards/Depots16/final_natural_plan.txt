Plan (step-by-step, matching the provided plan exactly)

Step 1 — Time: t = 0s, Duration: ~1s
- Action: analyzer1_propose_meeting(object_9, object_2, object_0)
- Actor: analyzer_1
- Parameters (types): object_9 = meeting, object_2 = timeslot, object_0 = agent
- Preconditions (checked before execution):
  - (meeting object_9) — true in initial state
  - (timeslot object_2) — true in initial state
  - (agent object_0) — true in initial state
  - (free object_2) — true in initial state
  => All preconditions satisfied.
- Effects (applied at completion):
  - Adds: (proposal object_9 object_2)
  - No deletes
- Notes: This step creates the proposal that the meeting object_9 be held at timeslot object_2.

Step 2 — Time: t = 1s, Duration: ~1s
- Action: analyzer2_confirm_meeting(object_9, object_0, object_1, object_2, object_6)
- Actor: analyzer_2
- Parameters (types): object_9 = meeting, object_0 = agent (a1), object_1 = agent (a2), object_2 = timeslot, object_6 = room
- Preconditions (checked before execution):
  - (meeting object_9) — true
  - (participant object_9 object_0) — true in initial state
  - (participant object_9 object_1) — true in initial state
  - (timeslot object_2) — true
  - (proposal object_9 object_2) — added by Step 1
  - (free object_2) — true before this step
  - (room object_6) — true
  - (room-available object_6) — true in initial state
  => All preconditions satisfied.
- Effects (applied at completion):
  - Adds: (confirmed object_9 object_0), (confirmed object_9 object_1), (scheduled object_9 object_2), (reserved object_6 object_2)
  - Deletes: (free object_2), (room-available object_6)
- Notes: This step confirms both required participants, schedules the meeting at the proposed earliest slot, and reserves the chosen room; it also consumes the free-timeslot and room-availability resources.

Final outcome (after Step 2)
- Achieved facts:
  - (scheduled object_9 object_2)
  - (reserved object_6 object_2)
  - (confirmed object_9 object_0)
  - (confirmed object_9 object_1)
- Deleted/consumed facts:
  - (free object_2) — no longer true
  - (room-available object_6) — no longer true
- Goal status: All goal predicates are satisfied. Plan cost: 2 (unit-cost steps).
