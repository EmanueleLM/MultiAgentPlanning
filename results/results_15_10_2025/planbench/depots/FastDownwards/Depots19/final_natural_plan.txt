Below is a human-readable, step-by-step execution of the provided plan. Each step matches exactly one action from the plan, lists the executing agent (inferred from the action name prefix alpha_/beta_), the parameters used, the preconditions checked at that time, and the effects (what facts are added and deleted). I report a timestamp and a duration of 1.0 time unit for every action (unit-cost plan; timestamps start at 0.0).

Step 1 — time 0.0 → 1.0 (duration 1.0)
- Action: beta_wretched(object_3, object_7, object_6, object_1)
- Agent: beta
- Preconditions checked (must be true before executing):
  - sneeze object_3
  - texture object_7
  - texture object_6
  - stupendous object_1
  - next object_3 object_7
  - collect object_7 object_1
  - collect object_6 object_1
- Effects:
  - Add: next object_3 object_6
  - Delete: next object_3 object_7

Step 2 — time 1.0 → 2.0 (duration 1.0)
- Action: alpha_clip(object_11, object_3, object_6)
- Agent: alpha
- Preconditions checked:
  - hand object_11
  - sneeze object_3
  - texture object_6
  - next object_3 object_6 (added by Step 1)
  - next object_11 object_6 (present in initial state)
- Effects:
  - Add: vase object_11 object_3
  - Delete: next object_11 object_6

Step 3 — time 2.0 → 3.0 (duration 1.0)
- Action: beta_wretched(object_3, object_6, object_5, object_1)
- Agent: beta
- Preconditions checked:
  - sneeze object_3
  - texture object_6
  - texture object_5
  - stupendous object_1
  - next object_3 object_6 (added by Step 1)
  - collect object_6 object_1
  - collect object_5 object_1
- Effects:
  - Add: next object_3 object_5
  - Delete: next object_3 object_6

Step 4 — time 3.0 → 4.0 (duration 1.0)
- Action: beta_tightfisted(object_11, object_3, object_5)
- Agent: beta
- Preconditions checked:
  - hand object_11
  - sneeze object_3
  - texture object_5
  - next object_3 object_5 (added by Step 3)
  - vase object_11 object_3 (added by Step 2)
- Effects:
  - Add: next object_11 object_5
  - Delete: vase object_11 object_3

Step 5 — time 4.0 → 5.0 (duration 1.0)
- Action: beta_memory(object_0, object_8, object_5)
- Agent: beta
- Preconditions checked:
  - cats object_0
  - spring object_8
  - spring object_5
  - next object_0 object_8
- Effects:
  - Add: next object_0 object_5
  - Delete: next object_0 object_8

Step 6 — time 5.0 → 6.0 (duration 1.0)
- Action: alpha_sip(object_11, object_0, object_5)
- Agent: alpha
- Preconditions checked:
  - hand object_11
  - cats object_0
  - texture object_5
  - next object_11 object_5 (added by Step 4)
  - next object_0 object_5 (added by Step 5)
- Effects:
  - Add: vase object_11 object_0
  - Delete: next object_11 object_5

Step 7 — time 6.0 → 7.0 (duration 1.0)
- Action: beta_memory(object_0, object_5, object_8)
- Agent: beta
- Preconditions checked:
  - cats object_0
  - spring object_5
  - spring object_8
  - next object_0 object_5 (added by Step 5)
- Effects:
  - Add: next object_0 object_8
  - Delete: next object_0 object_5

Step 8 — time 7.0 → 8.0 (duration 1.0)
- Action: alpha_paltry(object_11, object_0, object_8)
- Agent: alpha
- Preconditions checked:
  - hand object_11
  - cats object_0
  - texture object_8
  - vase object_11 object_0 (added by Step 6)
  - next object_0 object_8 (added by Step 7)
- Effects:
  - Add: next object_11 object_8
  - Delete: vase object_11 object_0

Step 9 — time 8.0 → 9.0 (duration 1.0)
- Action: alpha_clip(object_11, object_4, object_8)
- Agent: alpha
- Preconditions checked:
  - hand object_11
  - sneeze object_4
  - texture object_8
  - next object_4 object_8 (present in initial state)
  - next object_11 object_8 (added by Step 8)
- Effects:
  - Add: vase object_11 object_4
  - Delete: next object_11 object_8

Step 10 — time 9.0 → 10.0 (duration 1.0)
- Action: beta_wretched(object_4, object_8, object_10, object_2)
- Agent: beta
- Preconditions checked:
  - sneeze object_4
  - texture object_8
  - texture object_10
  - stupendous object_2
  - next object_4 object_8 (present initially)
  - collect object_8 object_2
  - collect object_10 object_2
- Effects:
  - Add: next object_4 object_10
  - Delete: next object_4 object_8

Step 11 — time 10.0 → 11.0 (duration 1.0)
- Action: beta_tightfisted(object_11, object_4, object_10)
- Agent: beta
- Preconditions checked:
  - hand object_11
  - sneeze object_4
  - texture object_10
  - next object_4 object_10 (added by Step 10)
  - vase object_11 object_4 (added by Step 9)
- Effects:
  - Add: next object_11 object_10
  - Delete: vase object_11 object_4

Goal check (after Step 11)
- Goal: next object_11 object_10
- Status: Achieved (added by Step 11)

Summary:
- The provided sequence of 11 actions, executed in order with unit durations, produces the required goal next object_11 object_10 at time 11.0.
- Each step above corresponds exactly to the actions in the original plan (no additions or deletions), and preconditions/effects shown reflect the domain definitions.
