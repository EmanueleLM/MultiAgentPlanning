Step 1 — time 0s (duration 1s)
Action: memory_analyst1(object_1, object_6, object_7)
- Agent: analyst1
- Meaning: move the "next" link for object_1 from object_6 to object_7.
- Preconditions checked: cats(object_1), spring(object_6), spring(object_7), next(object_1, object_6).
- Effects applied: add next(object_1, object_7); remove next(object_1, object_6).

Step 2 — time 1s (duration 1s)
Action: sip_analyst1(object_9, object_1, object_7)
- Agent: analyst1
- Meaning: create vase(object_9, object_1) by using the shared next links to object_7.
- Preconditions checked: hand(object_9), cats(object_1), texture(object_7), next(object_9, object_7), next(object_1, object_7).
- Effects applied: add vase(object_9, object_1); remove next(object_9, object_7).

Step 3 — time 2s (duration 1s)
Action: memory_analyst1(object_1, object_7, object_6)
- Agent: analyst1
- Meaning: move the "next" link for object_1 from object_7 back to object_6.
- Preconditions checked: cats(object_1), spring(object_7), spring(object_6), next(object_1, object_7).
- Effects applied: add next(object_1, object_6); remove next(object_1, object_7).

Step 4 — time 3s (duration 1s)
Action: paltry_analyst1(object_9, object_1, object_6)
- Agent: analyst1
- Meaning: use vase(object_9, object_1) and next(object_1, object_6) to create next(object_9, object_6) (and consume the vase).
- Preconditions checked: hand(object_9), cats(object_1), texture(object_6), vase(object_9, object_1), next(object_1, object_6).
- Effects applied: add next(object_9, object_6); remove vase(object_9, object_1).

Result (after 4 steps)
- Goal facts achieved: next(object_8, object_7) (already true from the initial state) and next(object_9, object_6) (established at Step 4).
- Plan cost: 4 steps.
