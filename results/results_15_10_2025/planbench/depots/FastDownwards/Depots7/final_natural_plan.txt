Plan executed as a human-readable, step-by-step trace (each step = 1 time unit; timestamps shown as start_time → end_time):

Step 1 — t=0 → t=1
Action: clip object_10 object_5 object_9
- Preconditions checked and satisfied before execution:
  - (hand object_10) — present in initial state
  - (sneeze object_5) — present in initial state
  - (texture object_9) — present in initial state
  - (next object_5 object_9) — present in initial state
  - (next object_10 object_9) — present in initial state
- Effects applied:
  - Added: (vase object_10 object_5)
  - Deleted: (next object_10 object_9)
- Summary state change: object_10 loses its "next to object_9" relation; a vase relation between object_10 and object_5 is created.

Step 2 — t=1 → t=2
Action: wretched object_5 object_9 object_8 object_3
- Preconditions checked and satisfied at this time:
  - (sneeze object_5) — true
  - (texture object_9) and (texture object_8) — both true
  - (stupendous object_3) — true
  - (next object_5 object_9) — still true (was not removed by Step 1)
  - (collect object_9 object_3) and (collect object_8 object_3) — both present in initial state
- Effects applied:
  - Added: (next object_5 object_8)
  - Deleted: (next object_5 object_9)
- Summary state change: object_5's next relation moves from object_9 to object_8.

Step 3 — t=2 → t=3
Action: tightfisted object_10 object_5 object_8
- Preconditions checked and satisfied at this time:
  - (hand object_10) — true
  - (sneeze object_5) — true
  - (texture object_8) — true
  - (next object_5 object_8) — became true in Step 2
  - (vase object_10 object_5) — became true in Step 1
- Effects applied:
  - Added: (next object_10 object_8)
  - Deleted: (vase object_10 object_5)
- Summary state change: object_10 gains "next to object_8" and the vase relation with object_5 is removed.

Step 4 — t=3 → t=4
Action: sip object_10 object_0 object_8
- Preconditions checked and satisfied at this time:
  - (hand object_10) — true
  - (cats object_0) — true
  - (texture object_8) — true
  - (next object_10 object_8) — became true in Step 3
  - (next object_0 object_8) — present in initial state and not yet removed
- Effects applied:
  - Added: (vase object_10 object_0)
  - Deleted: (next object_10 object_8)
- Summary state change: object_10 loses "next to object_8" and now has a vase relation with object_0.

Step 5 — t=4 → t=5
Action: memory object_0 object_8 object_6
- Preconditions checked and satisfied at this time:
  - (cats object_0) — true
  - (spring object_8) and (spring object_6) — both true in initial state
  - (next object_0 object_8) — still true (not modified by prior steps)
- Effects applied:
  - Added: (next object_0 object_6)
  - Deleted: (next object_0 object_8)
- Summary state change: object_0's next relation moves from object_8 to object_6.

Step 6 — t=5 → t=6
Action: paltry object_10 object_0 object_6
- Preconditions checked and satisfied at this time:
  - (hand object_10) — true
  - (cats object_0) — true
  - (texture object_6) — true
  - (vase object_10 object_0) — became true in Step 4
  - (next object_0 object_6) — became true in Step 5
- Effects applied:
  - Added: (next object_10 object_6)
  - Deleted: (vase object_10 object_0)
- Summary state change: object_10 now has (next object_10 object_6), the specified goal relation.

Final check — t=6
- Goal (next object_10 object_6) is achieved after Step 6.
- Plan cost: 6 actions (unit cost each), matching the provided cost = 6.

Notes:
- Every step strictly follows the actions in the provided plan and all preconditions were validated against the evolving state prior to execution.
- Each action's stated effects were applied in order; no extra actions were added or removed.
