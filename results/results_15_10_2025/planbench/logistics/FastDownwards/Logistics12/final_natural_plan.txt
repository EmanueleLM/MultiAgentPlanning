Final check (at t=17): all goal relations are present
  - next(object_10, object_8) — produced at step 16
  - next(object_11, object_7) — produced at step 13
  - next(object_9, object_6)  — produced at step 11
  - next(object_10, object_7) — produced at step 17
  - next(object_11, object_9) — produced at step 7
  - next(object_12, object_8) — produced at step 4

Plan cost = 17, total duration = 17 time units.
