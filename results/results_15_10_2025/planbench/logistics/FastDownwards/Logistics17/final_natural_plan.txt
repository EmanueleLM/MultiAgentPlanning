Below is a clear, step-by-step, human-readable rendering of the given PDDL plan. I list each plan action in order, give a timestamp (assuming each action takes 1 time unit, starting at t=0), state the main preconditions used (whether they were true initially or produced earlier), and state the action effects in plain language (which predicates are added and which are deleted).

Final note (goal check)
- The goal required: next(object_10, object_6), next(object_11, object_9), next(object_12, object_7), next(object_13, object_9).
- After executing the above steps (in the given order) the plan produces these goal facts:
  - next(object_10, object_6) was added at Step 18,
  - next(object_11, object_9) was added at Step 13,
  - next(object_12, object_7) was added at Step 22,
  - next(object_13, object_9) was added at Step 12.
- The plan cost reported: 22 (unit cost).
