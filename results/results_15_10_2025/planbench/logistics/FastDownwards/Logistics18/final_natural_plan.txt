Below is a human-readable, step-by-step execution of the provided PDDL plan. Steps are listed in order, with a simple timestamp (start time = step index), a short natural-language description, the action’s required preconditions at that moment, the facts added and deleted by the action, and whether the preconditions were satisfied when the step executed. Each step duration is represented as 1 time unit.

Initial notable facts used in the checks (from the problem file):
- hand: object_10, object_11, object_12, object_13
- sneeze: object_3, object_4, object_5
- texture: object_5, object_6, object_7, object_8, object_9, object_10
- stupendous: object_1, object_2, object_3
- collect: many (including (collect object_7 object_1), (collect object_6 object_1), (collect object_9 object_2), (collect object_10 object_2), ...)
- initial next facts include: (next 0 8), (next 1 8), (next 10 7), (next 11 9), (next 12 8), (next 13 9), (next 4 7), (next 5 9), (next 11 6), (next 3 7), (next 4 8)

Plan (10 steps). All steps succeed; final goals are achieved.

Step 0 — time 0 (duration 1)
Action: clip object_10 object_4 object_7
- Natural-language: Using hand object_10 on sneeze object_4 with texture object_7 to form a vase linking hand object_10 to sneeze object_4, removing the current next link from object_10 to object_7.
- Preconditions required: (hand object_10), (sneeze object_4), (texture object_7), (next object_4 object_7), (next object_10 object_7)
- Preconditions satisfied? Yes (all true in initial state).
- Effects: add (vase object_10 object_4); delete (next object_10 object_7)

Step 1 — time 1 (duration 1)
Action: clip object_12 object_4 object_8
- Natural-language: Using hand object_12 on sneeze object_4 with texture object_8 to form vase(object_12,object_4), removing next(object_12,object_8).
- Preconditions required: (hand object_12), (sneeze object_4), (texture object_8), (next object_4 object_8), (next object_12 object_8)
- Preconditions satisfied? Yes.
- Effects: add (vase object_12 object_4); delete (next object_12 object_8)

Step 2 — time 2 (duration 1)
Action: tightfisted object_12 object_4 object_7

- Preconditions required: (hand object_12), (sneeze object_4), (texture object_7), (next object_4 object_7), (vase object_12 object_4)
- Preconditions satisfied? Yes (vase was added in Step 1, next(4,7) existed).
- Effects: add (next object_12 object_7); delete (vase object_12 object_4)

Step 3 — time 3 (duration 1)
Action: wretched object_4 object_7 object_6 object_1
- Natural-language: For sneeze object_4, using textures object_7→object_6 and stupendous object_1 (plus collect facts), change next of object_4 from object_7 to object_6.
- Preconditions required: (sneeze object_4), (texture object_7), (texture object_6), (stupendous object_1), (next object_4 object_7), (collect object_7 object_1), (collect object_6 object_1)
- Preconditions satisfied? Yes (collect facts and next(4,7) were present).
- Effects: add (next object_4 object_6); delete (next object_4 object_7)

Step 4 — time 4 (duration 1)
Action: clip object_11 object_4 object_6
- Natural-language: Using hand object_11 with sneeze object_4 and texture object_6 to form vase(object_11,object_4), removing next(object_11,object_6).
- Preconditions required: (hand object_11), (sneeze object_4), (texture object_6), (next object_4 object_6), (next object_11 object_6)
- Preconditions satisfied? Yes (next 4→6 was added in Step 3; next 11→6 was in initial state).
- Effects: add (vase object_11 object_4); delete (next object_11 object_6)

Step 5 — time 5 (duration 1)
Action: tightfisted object_10 object_4 object_6
- Natural-language: With hand object_10 and vase(object_10,object_4), change next of object_10 to object_6 (add next(object_10,object_6)) and remove vase(object_10,object_4).
- Preconditions required: (hand object_10), (sneeze object_4), (texture object_6), (next object_4 object_6), (vase object_10 object_4)
- Preconditions satisfied? Yes (vase from Step 0, next 4→6 from Step 3).
- Effects: add (next object_10 object_6); delete (vase object_10 object_4)

Step 6 — time 6 (duration 1)
Action: clip object_11 object_5 object_9
- Natural-language: Using hand object_11 on sneeze object_5 with texture object_9 to form vase(object_11,object_5), removing next(object_11,object_9).
- Preconditions required: (hand object_11), (sneeze object_5), (texture object_9), (next object_5 object_9), (next object_11 object_9)
- Preconditions satisfied? Yes (both next links existed in initial state and next(11,9) had not been removed until now).
- Effects: add (vase object_11 object_5); delete (next object_11 object_9)

Step 7 — time 7 (duration 1)
Action: wretched object_5 object_9 object_10 object_2
- Natural-language: For sneeze object_5, using textures object_9→object_10 and stupendous object_2 (plus collect facts), change next of object_5 from object_9 to object_10.
- Preconditions required: (sneeze object_5), (texture object_9), (texture object_10), (stupendous object_2), (next object_5 object_9), (collect object_9 object_2), (collect object_10 object_2)
- Preconditions satisfied? Yes (collect facts for 9 and 10 with object_2 are present; next(5,9) was initial and remained until this step).
- Effects: add (next object_5 object_10); delete (next object_5 object_9)

Step 8 — time 8 (duration 1)
Action: tightfisted object_11 object_5 object_10
- Natural-language: With hand object_11 and vase(object_11,object_5), change next of object_11 to object_10 (add next(object_11,object_10)) and remove vase(object_11,object_5).
- Preconditions required: (hand object_11), (sneeze object_5), (texture object_10), (next object_5 object_10), (vase object_11 object_5)
- Preconditions satisfied? Yes (vase added in Step 6; next(5,10) added in Step 7).
- Effects: add (next object_11 object_10); delete (vase object_11 object_5)

Step 9 — time 9 (duration 1)
Action: tightfisted object_11 object_4 object_8
- Natural-language: With hand object_11 and vase(object_11,object_4), change next of object_11 to object_8 (add next(object_11,object_8)) and remove vase(object_11,object_4).
- Preconditions required: (hand object_11), (sneeze object_4), (texture object_8), (next object_4 object_8), (vase object_11 object_4)
- Preconditions satisfied? Yes (next 4→8 existed in initial state; vase 11–4 was created in Step 4 and not yet removed).
- Effects: add (next object_11 object_8); delete (vase object_11 object_4)

Final state check (goals):
- Goal (next object_10 object_6): added in Step 5 — satisfied.
- Goal (next object_11 object_8): added in Step 9 — satisfied.
- Goal (next object_12 object_7): added in Step 2 — satisfied.
- Goal (next object_13 object_9): was present in the initial state and never deleted — satisfied.
- Goal (next object_11 object_10): added in Step 8 — satisfied.

Total steps: 10. (Matches the provided plan exactly.)
Total plan cost (unit cost per step): 10.

Summary:
- All 10 plan steps were applicable when executed (preconditions satisfied at each step).
- Effects at each step were applied as specified by the action schemas.
- The combined goals are achieved at the end of the sequence.
