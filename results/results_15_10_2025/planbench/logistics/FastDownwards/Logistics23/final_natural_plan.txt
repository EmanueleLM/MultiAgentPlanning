Plan (timeline with 1.0s per step). All actions are executed by player_a (the plan uses the _a variants). Each line shows: step number — timestamp — action(arguments) — brief preconditions (checked) — effects (what is added / what is removed).

1) t=0.0s → t=1.0s — clip_a(object_13, object_3, object_7)
   - Preconditions required (satisfied): hand object_13; sneeze object_3; texture object_7; next object_3 object_7; next object_13 object_7.
   - Effects: add (vase object_13 object_3); delete (next object_13 object_7).

2) t=1.0s → t=2.0s — wretched_a(object_3, object_7, object_6, object_1)
   - Preconditions required (satisfied): sneeze object_3; texture object_7; texture object_6; stupendous object_1; next object_3 object_7; collect object_7 object_1; collect object_6 object_1.
   - Effects: add (next object_3 object_6); delete (next object_3 object_7).

3) t=2.0s → t=3.0s — clip_a(object_11, object_3, object_6)
   - Preconditions required (satisfied): hand object_11; sneeze object_3; texture object_6; next object_3 object_6; next object_11 object_6.
   - Effects: add (vase object_11 object_3); delete (next object_11 object_6).

4) t=3.0s → t=4.0s — wretched_a(object_3, object_6, object_7, object_1)
   - Preconditions required (satisfied): sneeze object_3; texture object_6; texture object_7; stupendous object_1; next object_3 object_6; collect object_6 object_1; collect object_7 object_1.
   - Effects: add (next object_3 object_7); delete (next object_3 object_6).

5) t=4.0s → t=5.0s — tightfisted_a(object_11, object_3, object_7)
   - Preconditions required (satisfied): hand object_11; sneeze object_3; texture object_7; next object_3 object_7; vase object_11 object_3.
   - Effects: add (next object_11 object_7); delete (vase object_11 object_3).

6) t=5.0s → t=6.0s — wretched_a(object_3, object_7, object_9, object_2)
   - Preconditions required (satisfied): sneeze object_3; texture object_7; texture object_9; stupendous object_2; next object_3 object_7; collect object_7 object_2; collect object_9 object_2.
   - Effects: add (next object_3 object_9); delete (next object_3 object_7).

7) t=6.0s → t=7.0s — tightfisted_a(object_13, object_3, object_9)
   - Preconditions required (satisfied): hand object_13; sneeze object_3; texture object_9; next object_3 object_9; vase object_13 object_3.
   - Effects: add (next object_13 object_9); delete (vase object_13 object_3).

8) t=7.0s → t=8.0s — wretched_a(object_4, object_10, object_11, object_3)
   - Preconditions required (satisfied): sneeze object_4; texture object_10; texture object_11; stupendous object_3; next object_4 object_10; collect object_10 object_3; collect object_11 object_3.
   - Effects: add (next object_4 object_11); delete (next object_4 object_10).

9) t=8.0s → t=9.0s — clip_a(object_12, object_4, object_11)
   - Preconditions required (satisfied): hand object_12; sneeze object_4; texture object_11; next object_4 object_11; next object_12 object_11.
   - Effects: add (vase object_12 object_4); delete (next object_12 object_11).

10) t=9.0s → t=10.0s — tightfisted_a(object_12, object_4, object_8)
   - Preconditions required (satisfied): hand object_12; sneeze object_4; texture object_8; next object_4 object_8; vase object_12 object_4.
   - Effects: add (next object_12 object_8); delete (vase object_12 object_4).

Notes:
- Steps are listed exactly as in the provided PDDL plan and in the same order; no actions were added or removed.
- Each step shows the required preconditions (all satisfied at the time the step executes in the given plan) and the action effects in terms of predicates added/deleted.
- Total elapsed time: 10.0s (10 steps × 1.0s each).
