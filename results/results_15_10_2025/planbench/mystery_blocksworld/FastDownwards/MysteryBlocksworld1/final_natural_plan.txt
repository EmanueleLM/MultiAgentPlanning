Plan (2 steps, total cost 2)

Step 1 — time 0 → 1 (duration: 1 time unit)
Action: sip object_8 object_0 object_7
- Role mapping: sip(?o0 ?o1 ?o2) where ?o0=object_8 (hand), ?o1=object_0 (cats), ?o2=object_7 (texture).
- Preconditions checked (all satisfied at time 0):
  - (hand object_8) — true (initial)
  - (cats object_0) — true (initial)
  - (texture object_7) — true (initial)
  - (next object_8 object_7) — true (initial)
  - (next object_0 object_7) — true (initial)
- Effects applied at the end of the step:
  - Add: (vase object_8 object_0)
  - Delete: (next object_8 object_7)
- State changes (relevant facts):
  - Before: (next object_8 object_7) was true.
  - After: (vase object_8 object_0) is true; (next object_8 object_7) is no longer true.
  - Other facts remain unchanged.

Step 2 — time 1 → 2 (duration: 1 time unit)
Action: paltry object_8 object_0 object_6
- Role mapping: paltry(?o0 ?o1 ?o2) where ?o0=object_8 (hand), ?o1=object_0 (cats), ?o2=object_6 (texture).
- Preconditions checked (all satisfied at time 1):
  - (hand object_8) — true (initial)
  - (cats object_0) — true (initial)
  - (texture object_6) — true (initial)
  - (vase object_8 object_0) — true (added by Step 1)
  - (next object_0 object_6) — true (initial)
- Effects applied at the end of the step:
  - Add: (next object_8 object_6)
  - Delete: (vase object_8 object_0)
- State changes (relevant facts):
  - Before: (vase object_8 object_0) was true (from Step 1).
  - After: (next object_8 object_6) is true; (vase object_8 object_0) is no longer true.

Final relevant facts (after Step 2)
- (next object_7 object_6) — true (was true initially and never removed)
- (next object_8 object_6) — true (added by Step 2)

Goal check
- Required goals: (next object_7 object_6) AND (next object_8 object_6)
- Both are satisfied in the final state.

Summary
- Executed exactly the two plan steps provided, each with duration 1 time unit (timestamps shown).
- All preconditions were met when each action was applied.
- Final goals are achieved. Total plan cost: 2.
