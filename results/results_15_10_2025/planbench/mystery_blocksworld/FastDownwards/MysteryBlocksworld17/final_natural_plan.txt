Summary
- Provided plan: empty (0 actions; cost = 0).
- Initial facts (from the chosen problem variant) already include the goal predicates.
- Result: no actions are required; the goal is satisfied in the initial state.

Initial state (key ground predicates)
- cats object_0
- cats object_1
- collect object_6 object_2
- collect object_7 object_2
- collect object_8 object_3
- collect object_9 object_3
- hand object_10
- hand object_11
- hand object_12
- hand object_13
- stupendous object_2
- stupendous object_3

Goal
- stupendous object_2
- stupendous object_3

Plan (human-readable, step-by-step)
- Step 0 (timestamp 0.0s, duration 0.0s): No action executed (empty plan).
  - Preconditions checked: none (no actions to check).
  - Effects applied: none.
  - State after step: identical to initial state (see list above).
  - Goal check at this point: both required facts (stupendous object_2 and stupendous object_3) are present.

Outcome
- The empty plan is valid because the initial state already satisfies the goal.
- No precondition violations occurred (no actions executed).
- Plan cost: 0 (unit cost). Success: goal achieved.
