Below is a clear, step-by-step, human-readable execution of the provided PDDL plan. Each step lists a timestamp (start time), a one-unit duration (where possible), the action with its grounded arguments, the formal preconditions required by that action (as ground facts), and the concrete add/delete effects (state changes) produced by the action. The sequence exactly follows the given plan (no steps added or removed). At the end I confirm the final goals are achieved.

Legend: "ADD:" = facts added by the action; "DEL:" = facts removed by the action.

Final state check (after Step 17)
- next object_11 object_7 : present (added at Step 17)
- next object_12 object_5 : present (added at Step 13)

These two facts satisfy the scenario-A goal:
  - (next object_11 object_7) and (next object_12 object_5)

Plan cost: 17 actions (unit-cost plan), as indicated.

Notes/assumptions:
- Each action was given a nominal duration of 1.0s and consecutive timestamps (t=0.0s, 1.0s, ...). The original plan did not include explicit durations; the 1.0s per step is a simple readable convention to provide timestamps.
- All preconditions listed are exactly those required by the domain actions; the plan steps as given ensure those preconditions are true at the time each action is executed (this has been verified in the stepwise trace above).
