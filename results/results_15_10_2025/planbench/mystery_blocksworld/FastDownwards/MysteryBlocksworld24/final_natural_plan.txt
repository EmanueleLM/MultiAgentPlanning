Plan summary (cost = 3; each action unit cost)

Initial relevant facts (from the problem instance)
- hand object_0
- cats object_1
- next object_2 object_3
- texture object_4
- sneeze object_5
- stupendous object_6
- spring object_7
- collect object_8

Goal to achieve
- collect object_0
- vase object_1
- texture object_3

Step 1 — timestamp t=0, duration 1
Action: memory object_0 object_3
- Required precondition: texture object_3 must be false (not (texture object_3)).
- Check: texture object_3 is not present in the initial facts → precondition satisfied.
- Effects applied:
  - Add (texture object_3).
  - Add (stupendous object_0).
- State change summary after step 1:
  - texture object_3 is now true.
  - stupendous object_0 is now true.

Step 2 — timestamp t=1, duration 1
Action: tightfisted object_0
- Required precondition: collect object_0 must be false (not (collect object_0)).
- Check: initial collect facts only included collect object_8; collect object_0 was false and was not made true by step 1 → precondition satisfied.
- Effects applied:
  - Add (collect object_0).
- State change summary after step 2:
  - collect object_0 is now true.

Step 3 — timestamp t=2, duration 1
Action: paltry object_1 object_1
- Required preconditions:
  - cats object_1 must be true.
  - vase object_1 must be false (not (vase object_1)).
- Check: initial facts contained cats object_1 and did not contain vase object_1; none of the prior steps added or removed cats object_1 or vase object_1 → preconditions satisfied.
- Effects applied:
  - Add (collect object_1).
  - Delete (cats object_1).
  - Add (vase object_1).
- State change summary after step 3:
  - vase object_1 is now true.
  - collect object_1 is now true.
  - cats object_1 is removed.

Final check (after all steps)
- collect object_0: true (added in step 2) — goal satisfied.
- vase object_1: true (added in step 3) — goal satisfied.
- texture object_3: true (added in step 1) — goal satisfied.

Conclusion: The three actions executed in order (memory object_0 object_3; tightfisted object_0; paltry object_1 object_1) satisfy all goal predicates. Total plan cost = 3.
