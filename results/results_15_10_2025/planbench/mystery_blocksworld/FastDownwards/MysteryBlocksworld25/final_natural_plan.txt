Summary: the following 15-step execution follows the provided plan exactly. I list each step with a timestamp (assuming each action takes 1 time unit), the action with its parameters, the required preconditions and whether they are satisfied at that time, and the effects applied (facts added and deleted). The state is updated step-by-step so effects listed are the changes at that step.

Initial relevant facts (before step 0, from problem):
- hand: object_11, object_12, object_13
- cats: object_0
- texture: object_10, object_5, object_6, object_7, object_8, object_9
- sneeze: object_3, object_4
- spring: object_5, object_8
- stupendous: object_1, object_2
- collect: (10,2), (5,1), (6,1), (7,1), (8,2), (9,2)
- next: (0,8), (11,10), (12,6), (13,9), (3,7), (4,10)
- no vase facts initially.

Total actions in plan: 15. Cost: 15 (unit cost per action).

Final relevant facts (after Step 15), showing goal facts:
- (next object_11 object_8) — true (added Step 7)
- (next object_12 object_8) — true (added Step 15)
- (next object_13 object_10) — true (added Step 11)

All three goal facts are achieved by the end of the plan.

Notes and small clarifications:
- Each step above follows the action schemas in the given domain: preconditions are present at the time of execution and effects applied exactly as defined.
- Vases created by clip or sip are later consumed by tightfisted or paltry actions as required.
- Memory actions (steps 12 and 14) move the 'next' relation for object_0 between object_8 and object_5 and back — these are used to enable the sip and paltry sequence for object_12.
- No action in the plan required any fact that was not either in the initial state or produced by a prior step; thus the plan is consistent and executable as written.

If you want, I can produce a compact timeline table, or a one-line textual script (timestamps + actions) for quick reading.
