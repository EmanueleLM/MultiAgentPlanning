Step 1 — Time 0.0 → 1.0 (duration 1.0)
- Actor: player1
- Action: player1-clip object_9 object_4 object_7
- Parameters: h = object_9, s = object_4, t = object_7
- Preconditions relied on (all true in the initial state):
  - (hand object_9)
  - (sneeze object_4)
  - (texture object_7)
  - (next object_4 object_7)
  - (next object_9 object_7)
- Effects produced by this step:
  - Add: (vase object_9 object_4)
  - Delete: (next object_9 object_7)
- Notes: After this step, object_9 is no longer next to object_7, and a vase relation between object_9 and object_4 is established.

Step 2 — Time 1.0 → 2.0 (duration 1.0)
- Actor: player2
- Action: player2-wretched object_4 object_7 object_8 object_2
- Parameters: s0 = object_4, t1 = object_7, t2 = object_8, st = object_2
- Preconditions relied on (checked after Step 1):
  - (sneeze object_4) — true initially, unchanged
  - (texture object_7) — true initially, unchanged
  - (texture object_8) — true initially, unchanged
  - (stupendous object_2) — true initially, unchanged
  - (next object_4 object_7) — true (not modified by Step 1)
  - (collect object_7 object_2) — true initially
  - (collect object_8 object_2) — true initially
- Effects produced by this step:
  - Add: (next object_4 object_8)
  - Delete: (next object_4 object_7)
- Notes: This moves the "next" relation for object_4 from object_7 to object_8.

Step 3 — Time 2.0 → 3.0 (duration 1.0)
- Actor: player1
- Action: player1-tightfisted object_9 object_4 object_8
- Parameters: h = object_9, s = object_4, t = object_8
- Preconditions relied on (checked after Step 2):
  - (hand object_9) — true initially, unchanged
  - (sneeze object_4) — true initially, unchanged
  - (texture object_8) — true initially, unchanged
  - (next object_4 object_8) — became true in Step 2
  - (vase object_9 object_4) — created in Step 1
- Effects produced by this step:
  - Add: (next object_9 object_8)
  - Delete: (vase object_9 object_4)
- Notes: This step establishes (next object_9 object_8) and removes the temporary vase relation created earlier.

Final state / Goal check
- The declared goal (next object_9 object_8) is achieved after Step 3.
- No extra actions were added or removed; the three steps above follow the provided plan exactly.
