repeated patterns and many steps. The translation above preserves every action in the exact order given and labels each as performed by the consonant agent (for move-cons-... actions) or the vowel agent (for move-vowel-... actions). Stack names are shown as s1 and s2 as in the problem file. If you prefer a different timestamp convention (different step duration or start time) or want the same output mapped to human-friendly stack names (\"Stack1\", \"Stack2\") instead of s1/s2, I can produce that variant.",
