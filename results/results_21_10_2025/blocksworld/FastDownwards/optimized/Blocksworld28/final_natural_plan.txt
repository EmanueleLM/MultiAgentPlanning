Below is a step-by-step, human-readable replay of the provided plan. Each line corresponds exactly to one action in the plan (no actions added or removed). I show the acting agent, the action in plain language, and a short immediate result statement. I include an estimated timestamp for each action, assuming actions start at 00:00:00 and each action takes 5 seconds (timestamps are therefore approximate but given for every step as requested).
