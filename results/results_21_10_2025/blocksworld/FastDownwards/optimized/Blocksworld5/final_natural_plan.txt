Notes:
- All actions respect agent capabilities from the specification: vowel_agent moved only vowel-labeled blocks (A, E, I); consonant_agent moved only consonant-labeled blocks.  
- Each action respects the top-only move constraint (only unstack/pickup of top blocks, and stack/putdown onto clear locations).  
- Each listed step corresponds exactly to the action sequence in the provided plan; no actions were added or removed.
