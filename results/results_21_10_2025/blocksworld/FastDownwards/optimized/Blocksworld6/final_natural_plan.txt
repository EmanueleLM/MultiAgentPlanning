Below is a direct, human-readable translation of the given PDDL plan. Each step matches the plan exactly (no additions or deletions). I list the acting agent, the action in plain English, the blocks involved, and a timestamp/duration for each step (1.0s per step).

1) t=0.0s–1.0s — consonant_agent: Pick up B from on top of J. (consonant_agent is now holding B)
2) t=1.0s–2.0s — consonant_agent: Put down B onto C. (B is now on C; hand becomes empty)
3) t=2.0s–3.0s — consonant_agent: Unstack F from on top of E. (consonant_agent is now holding F; E becomes clear)
4) t=3.0s–4.0s — vowel_agent: Unstack E from on top of K. (vowel_agent is now holding E; K becomes clear)
5) t=4.0s–5.0s — vowel_agent: Put down E onto H. (E is now on H; vowel_agent hand empty)
6) t=5.0s–6.0s — vowel_agent: Unstack E from on top of H. (vowel_agent is now holding E; H becomes clear)
7) t=6.0s–7.0s — vowel_agent: Put down E onto F. (E is now on F; vowel_agent hand empty)
8) t=7.0s–8.0s — consonant_agent: Put down F onto G. (F is now on G; consonant_agent hand empty)
9) t=8.0s–9.0s — consonant_agent: Unstack H from on top of D. (consonant_agent is now holding H; D becomes clear)
10) t=9.0s–10.0s — consonant_agent: Put down H onto I. (H is now on I; consonant_agent hand empty)
11) t=10.0s–11.0s — consonant_agent: Unstack D from on top of C. (consonant_agent is now holding D; C becomes clear)
12) t=11.0s–12.0s — consonant_agent: Put down D onto E. (D is now on E; consonant_agent hand empty)
13) t=12.0s–13.0s — consonant_agent: Unstack H from on top of I. (consonant_agent is now holding H; I becomes clear)
14) t=13.0s–14.0s — vowel_agent: Unstack I from on top of A. (vowel_agent is now holding I; A becomes clear)
15) t=14.0s–15.0s — vowel_agent: Put down I onto J. (I is now on J; vowel_agent hand empty)
16) t=15.0s–16.0s — vowel_agent: Pick up A from on the table. (vowel_agent is now holding A)
17) t=16.0s–17.0s — vowel_agent: Put down A onto B. (A is now on B; vowel_agent hand empty)
18) t=17.0s–18.0s — consonant_agent: Put down H onto I. (H is now on I; consonant_agent hand empty)
19) t=18.0s–19.0s — vowel_agent: Unstack I from on top of J. (vowel_agent is now holding I; J becomes clear)
20) t=19.0s–20.0s — vowel_agent: Put down I onto J. (I is placed back on J; vowel_agent hand empty)
21) t=20.0s–21.0s — consonant_agent: Pick up C from on the table. (consonant_agent is now holding C)
22) t=21.0s–22.0s — consonant_agent: Put down C onto D. (C is now on D; consonant_agent hand empty)
23) t=22.0s–23.0s — consonant_agent: Pick up J from on top of G. (consonant_agent is now holding J)
24) t=23.0s–24.0s — consonant_agent: Put down J onto K. (J is now on K; consonant_agent hand empty)
25) t=24.0s–25.0s — consonant_agent: Unstack K from on top of L. (consonant_agent is now holding K; L becomes clear)
26) t=25.0s–26.0s — consonant_agent: Put down K onto L. (K is now on L; consonant_agent hand empty)
27) t=26.0s–27.0s — consonant_agent: Pick up L from on top of I. (consonant_agent is now holding L)
28) t=27.0s–28.0s — consonant_agent: Put down L onto the table. (L is now on the table; consonant_agent hand empty)

End state after step 28: the stack configuration matches the goal ordering (A on B, B on C, C on D, D on E, E on F, F on G, G on H, H on I, I on J, J on K, K on L, and L on the table). Total plan duration shown here: 28.0s (28 steps × 1.0s).
