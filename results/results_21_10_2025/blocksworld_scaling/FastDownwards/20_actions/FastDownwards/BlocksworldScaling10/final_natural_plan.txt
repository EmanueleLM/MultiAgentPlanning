Below is a step-by-step, human-readable execution of the provided PDDL plan. Each step lists the agent performing the action, the block moved and source/target, the original PDDL action (for direct correspondence), a timestamp, and a 10-second duration per move (consistent timing for readability). The steps are presented in the exact order from the plan (no additions or deletions).

1. [00:00:00 → 00:00:10] consonant_agent moves block C from A onto D. (consonant-move-block-to-block c a d)  
2. [00:00:10 → 00:00:20] vowel_agent moves block A from G to the table. (vowel-move-block-to-table a g)  
3. [00:00:20 → 00:00:30] consonant_agent moves block F from E onto G. (consonant-move-block-to-block f e g)  
4. [00:00:30 → 00:00:40] vowel_agent moves block E from I onto F. (vowel-move-block-to-block e i f)  
5. [00:00:40 → 00:00:50] consonant_agent moves block J from B to the table. (consonant-move-block-to-table j b)  
6. [00:00:50 → 00:01:00] vowel_agent moves block I from the table onto J. (vowel-move-table-to-block i j)  
7. [00:01:00 → 00:01:10] consonant_agent moves block C from D to the table. (consonant-move-block-to-table c d)  
8. [00:01:10 → 00:01:20] consonant_agent moves block B from the table onto C. (consonant-move-table-to-block b c)  
9. [00:01:20 → 00:01:30] vowel_agent moves block A from the table onto B. (vowel-move-table-to-block a b)  
10. [00:01:30 → 00:01:40] consonant_agent moves block D from H onto E. (consonant-move-block-to-block d h e)  
11. [00:01:40 → 00:01:50] consonant_agent moves block H from the table onto I. (consonant-move-table-to-block h i)  
12. [00:01:50 → 00:02:00] consonant_agent moves block D from E to the table. (consonant-move-block-to-table d e)  
13. [00:02:00 → 00:02:10] vowel_agent moves block E from F to the table. (vowel-move-block-to-table e f)  
14. [00:02:10 → 00:02:20] consonant_agent moves block D from the table onto E. (consonant-move-table-to-block d e)  
15. [00:02:20 → 00:02:30] consonant_agent moves block F from G to the table. (consonant-move-block-to-table f g)  
16. [00:02:30 → 00:02:40] consonant_agent moves block G from the table onto H. (consonant-move-table-to-block g h)  
17. [00:02:40 → 00:02:50] consonant_agent moves block F from the table onto G. (consonant-move-table-to-block f g)  
18. [00:02:50 → 00:03:00] consonant_agent moves block D from E to the table. (consonant-move-block-to-table d e)  
19. [00:03:00 → 00:03:10] vowel_agent moves block E from the table onto F. (vowel-move-table-to-block e f)  
20. [00:03:10 → 00:03:20] consonant_agent moves block D from the table onto E. (consonant-move-table-to-block d e)  
21. [00:03:20 → 00:03:30] vowel_agent moves block A from B to the table. (vowel-move-block-to-table a b)  
22. [00:03:30 → 00:03:40] consonant_agent moves block B from C to the table. (consonant-move-block-to-table b c)  
23. [00:03:40 → 00:03:50] vowel_agent moves block A from the table onto B. (vowel-move-table-to-block a b)  
24. [00:03:50 → 00:04:00] consonant_agent moves block C from D onto B. (consonant-move-table-to-block c d)  
25. [00:04:00 → 00:04:10] vowel_agent moves block A from B to the table. (vowel-move-block-to-table a b)  
26. [00:04:10 → 00:04:20] consonant_agent moves block B from the table onto C. (consonant-move-table-to-block b c)  
27. [00:04:20 → 00:04:30] vowel_agent moves block A from the table onto B. (vowel-move-table-to-block a b)

Final check (after step 27): the resulting single tower from the table upward is
J (on table) → I → H → G → F → E → D → C → B → A,
which matches the specified global goal. Total planned execution time (with 10 s per move): 4 minutes 30 seconds.
