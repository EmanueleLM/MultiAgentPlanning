Final status (after step 51, time 00:00:51):
- The plan has completed the listed 51 actions (cost = 51).
- Per the original plan goal, this sequence reaches the target single stack with A on B, B on C, C on D, D on E, E on F, F on G, G on H, H on I, I on J, J on K, K on L, L on M, and M on the table.
