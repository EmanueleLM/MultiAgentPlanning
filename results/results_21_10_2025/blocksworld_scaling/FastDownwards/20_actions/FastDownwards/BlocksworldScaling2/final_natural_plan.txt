Below is a step-by-step, human-readable trace of the provided FastDownward plan. Each step reports a start timestamp (assumed unit-duration actions), the agent executing it (vowel_agent can only move vowels A, E, I, O, U; consonant_agent can only move consonants), and a concise pick/place description that matches the plan action exactly. I use uppercase block labels (A..O) consistent with the specification. There are 40 actions; each action is assumed to take 1 time unit. Total plan cost = 40; final time = 40.

Summary:
- Actions executed in the exact order given by the plan (40 steps).
- Agents respected their type restrictions in the plan trace: consonant_agent moves consonants, vowel_agent moves vowels.
- Assumed unit duration per action; timestamps shown accordingly. Total execution time = 40 units; total cost = 40.
- The above sequence is a literal, human-readable mapping of the provided PDDL plan steps.
