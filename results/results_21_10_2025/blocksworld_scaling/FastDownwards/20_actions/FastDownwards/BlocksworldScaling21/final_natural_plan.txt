Here are the 27 steps from the provided plan translated into clear, human-readable actions. I list a simple timestamp for each action assuming each action takes 1.0s and actions execute sequentially (start time of step n = n-1 seconds). Agent names follow the specification constraints (vowel_agent moves only A/E/I; consonant_agent moves only consonants).

1) t=0.0s → 1.0s — consonant_agent: Pick C from on top of block G in stack S2.  
   - Effect: consonant_agent is now holding C; C removed from on G (S2).

2) t=1.0s → 2.0s — consonant_agent: Place C onto empty stack S4.  
   - Effect: C is now on S4 (top), consonant_agent's hand becomes empty.

3) t=2.0s → 3.0s — consonant_agent: Pick B from on top of block J in stack S3.  
   - Effect: consonant_agent is now holding B; B removed from on J (S3).

4) t=3.0s → 4.0s — consonant_agent: Place B onto block C (which is on S4).  
   - Effect: B is now on C in stack S4 (B becomes the new top), consonant_agent's hand becomes empty.

5) t=4.0s → 5.0s — consonant_agent: Pick J from on top of block I in stack S3.  
   - Effect: consonant_agent is now holding J; J removed from on I (S3).

6) t=5.0s → 6.0s — consonant_agent: Place J onto block D in stack S1.  
   - Effect: J is now on D in S1 (J becomes the new top there), consonant_agent's hand becomes empty.

7) t=6.0s → 7.0s — vowel_agent: Pick I from on top of stack S3 (I was on S3).  
   - Effect: vowel_agent is now holding I; I removed from S3.

8) t=7.0s → 8.0s — vowel_agent: Place I onto block J in stack S1.  
   - Effect: I is now on J in S1 (I is the new top there), vowel_agent's hand becomes empty.

9) t=8.0s → 9.0s — consonant_agent: Pick G from on top of block F in stack S2.  
   - Effect: consonant_agent is now holding G; G removed from on F (S2).

10) t=9.0s → 10.0s — consonant_agent: Place G onto block I in stack S1.  
    - Effect: G is now on I in S1 (G becomes the new top), consonant_agent's hand becomes empty.

11) t=10.0s → 11.0s — consonant_agent: Pick F from on top of block E in stack S2.  
    - Effect: consonant_agent is now holding F; F removed from on E (S2).

12) t=11.0s → 12.0s — consonant_agent: Place F onto block G in stack S1.  
    - Effect: F is now on G in S1 (F becomes the new top), consonant_agent's hand becomes empty.

13) t=12.0s → 13.0s — vowel_agent: Pick E from on top of block H in stack S2.  
    - Effect: vowel_agent is now holding E; E removed from on H (S2).

14) t=13.0s → 14.0s — consonant_agent: Pick F from on top of block G in stack S1.  
    - Effect: consonant_agent is now holding F; F removed from on G (S1).

15) t=14.0s → 15.0s — consonant_agent: Place F onto empty stack S3.  
    - Effect: F is now on S3 (top); consonant_agent's hand becomes empty.

16) t=15.0s → 16.0s — vowel_agent: Place E onto block F in stack S3.  
    - Effect: E is now on F in S3 (E becomes the new top), vowel_agent's hand becomes empty.

17) t=16.0s → 17.0s — consonant_agent: Pick G from on top of block I in stack S1.  
    - Effect: consonant_agent is now holding G; G removed from on I (S1).

18) t=17.0s → 18.0s — consonant_agent: Place G onto block E in stack S3.  
    - Effect: G is now on E in S3 (G becomes the new top), consonant_agent's hand becomes empty.

19) t=18.0s → 19.0s — vowel_agent: Pick I from on top of block J in stack S1.  
    - Effect: vowel_agent is now holding I; I removed from on J (S1).

20) t=19.0s → 20.0s — consonant_agent: Pick J from on top of block D in stack S1.  
    - Effect: consonant_agent is now holding J; J removed from on D (S1).

21) t=20.0s → 21.0s — consonant_agent: Place J onto empty stack S5.  
    - Effect: J is now on S5 (top), consonant_agent's hand becomes empty.

22) t=21.0s → 22.0s — vowel_agent: Place I onto block J in stack S5.  
    - Effect: I is now on J in S5, vowel_agent's hand becomes empty.

23) t=22.0s → 23.0s — consonant_agent: Pick D from on top of block K in stack S1.  
    - Effect: consonant_agent is now holding D; D removed from on K (S1).

24) t=23.0s → 24.0s — consonant_agent: Place D onto block G in stack S3.  
    - Effect: D is now on G in S3 (D becomes the new top), consonant_agent's hand becomes empty.

25) t=24.0s → 25.0s — consonant_agent: Pick K from on top of block A in stack S1.  
    - Effect: consonant_agent is now holding K; K removed from on A (S1).

26) t=25.0s → 26.0s — vowel_agent: Pick A from on top of stack S1 (A was on S1).  
    - Effect: vowel_agent is now holding A; A removed from S1.

27) t=26.0s → 27.0s — vowel_agent: Place A onto block B in stack S4.  
    - Effect: A is now on B in stack S4, vowel_agent's hand becomes empty.

Final check (as required by the problem): after these steps the goal facts are satisfied:  
- A is on B (A on B in S4),  
- E is on F (E on F in S3),  
- I is on J (I on J in S5).

Notes:  
- Each step corresponds exactly to one action in the provided plan and respects the agents' movement constraints (vowel_agent moved only A/E/I; consonant_agent moved only consonants).  
- Timestamps are given assuming unit duration per action and strictly sequential execution.
