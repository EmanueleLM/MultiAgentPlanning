All 30 steps are executed in the given order. Each move is performed by the agent authorized for that block type (vowel_agent moved only A, E, I; consonant_agent moved the other letters) and follows the “move one top block at a time” constraint. The final stacking achieved by these steps satisfies the goal: A on B, B on C, C on D, D on E, E on F, F on G, G on H, H on I, I on J, J on K, with K on the table.
