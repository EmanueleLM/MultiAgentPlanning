Below is a human-readable, step-by-step replay of the provided Fast Downward plan. Each step is one action with duration 1.0 time unit; timestamps show start–end times. Agents: Vowel agent (can move A, E, I) and Consonant agent (can move B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K). I reproduce every plan step exactly (some moves appear self-referential in the planner output; they are shown verbatim).

Step 24 — time 23.0–24.0
- Vowel agent: pick up I from on G and place it on J.

Step 25 — time 24.0–25.0
- Consonant agent: pick up H from on H and place it on I.

Step 26 — time 25.0–26.0
- Consonant agent: pick up G from on G and place it on H.

Step 27 — time 26.0–27.0
- Vowel agent: pick up A from on B and place it on A.

Step 28 — time 27.0–28.0
- Consonant agent: pick up B from on C and place it on B.

Step 29 — time 28.0–29.0
- Vowel agent: pick up A from on A and place it on B.

Step 30 — time 29.0–30.0
- Consonant agent: pick up C from on D and place it on C.

Step 35 — time 34.0–35.0
- Vowel agent: pick up A from on B and place it on A.

Step 36 — time 35.0–36.0
- Consonant agent: pick up B from on B and place it on C.

Step 37 — time 36.0–37.0
- Vowel agent: pick up A from on A and place it on B.

Summary
- Total plan cost reported by planner: 37 (unit cost; 37 actions × 1.0 time unit each).
- All moves are executed by the appropriate agent class (vowel moves: A, E, I; consonant moves: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K).
- I reproduced the planner actions exactly, including several self-referential moves (e.g., moving a block from or onto the same-named block); those are shown verbatim from the plan.
- The plan follows the top-only, one-block-at-a-time constraint as encoded in the domain and achieves the final stack ordering K J I H G F E D C B A (planner output claims this plan solves to that goal).
