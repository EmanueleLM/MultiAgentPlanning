Below are the 31 steps from the plan translated into clear, human-readable actions. Each step lists the acting agent, the block moved, where it was moved from and to, and a simple timestamp (1 second per step). I follow the plan exactly and do not add or remove actions.

1. t=0s — consonant_agent: Move block C from on I to on D. (move-consonant-from-block-to-block c i d)  
2. t=1s — consonant_agent: Move block F from on H to on F. (move-consonant-from-block-to-block f h f)

9. t=8s — vowel_agent: Move block I from on B to on I. (move-vowel-from-block-to-block i b i)  
10. t=9s — consonant_agent: Move block B from on J to on C. (move-consonant-from-block-to-block b j c)

16. t=15s — consonant_agent: Move block F from on G to on F. (move-consonant-from-block-to-block f g f)  
17. t=16s — consonant_agent: Move block G from on G to on H. (move-consonant-from-block-to-block g g h)  
18. t=17s — consonant_agent: Move block F from on F to on G. (move-consonant-from-block-to-block f f g)  
19. t=18s — vowel_agent: Move block A from on B to on A. (move-vowel-from-block-to-block a b a)  
20. t=19s — consonant_agent: Move block B from on C to on B. (move-consonant-from-block-to-block b c b)  
21. t=20s — vowel_agent: Move block A from on A to on B. (move-vowel-from-block-to-block a a b)  
22. t=21s — consonant_agent: Move block C from on D to on C. (move-consonant-from-block-to-block c d c)  
23. t=22s — consonant_agent: Move block D from on E to on D. (move-consonant-from-block-to-block d e d)  
24. t=23s — consonant_agent: Move block C from on C to on D. (move-consonant-from-block-to-block c c d)

29. t=28s — vowel_agent: Move block A from on B to on A. (move-vowel-from-block-to-block a b a)  
30. t=29s — consonant_agent: Move block B from on B to on C. (move-consonant-from-block-to-block b b c)  
31. t=30s — vowel_agent: Move block A from on A to on B. (move-vowel-from-block-to-block a a b)

Result (goal achieved): a single tower with K on the table, then J on K, I on J, H on I, G on H, F on G, E on F, D on E, C on D, B on C, and A on B.
