Assumptions: timestamps are simulated in 1-second increments for readability (Step 1 at t=0s, Step 2 at t=1s, ...). Each line reports the acting agent and the exact move given in the plan (block names capitalized).

1. [t = 0s] consonant_agent: move block H from on B to on H.  
2. [t = 1s] consonant_agent: move block B from on I to on B.  
3. [t = 2s] vowel_agent: move block A from on D to on B.  
4. [t = 3s] consonant_agent: move block D from on C to on D.  
5. [t = 4s] vowel_agent: move block I from on G to on I.  
6. [t = 5s] consonant_agent: move block G from on E to on H.  
7. [t = 6s] vowel_agent: move block E from on J to on F.  
8. [t = 7s] consonant_agent: move block D from on D to on E.  
9. [t = 8s] consonant_agent: move block C from on table to on D.  
10. [t = 9s] vowel_agent: move block I from on I to on J.  
11. [t = 10s] consonant_agent: move block G from on H to on G.  
12. [t = 11s] consonant_agent: move block H from on H to on I.  
13. [t = 12s] consonant_agent: move block G from on G to on H.  
14. [t = 13s] consonant_agent: move block C from on D to on C.  
15. [t = 14s] vowel_agent: move block A from on B to on A.  
16. [t = 15s] consonant_agent: move block B from on B to on C.  
17. [t = 16s] vowel_agent: move block A from on A to on B.  
18. [t = 17s] consonant_agent: move block D from on E to on D.  
19. [t = 18s] vowel_agent: move block E from on F to on E.  
20. [t = 19s] consonant_agent: move block D from on D to on E.  
21. [t = 20s] consonant_agent: move block F from on table to on G.  
22. [t = 21s] consonant_agent: move block D from on E to on D.  
23. [t = 22s] vowel_agent: move block E from on E to on F.  
24. [t = 23s] consonant_agent: move block D from on D to on E.  
25. [t = 24s] vowel_agent: move block A from on B to on A.  
26. [t = 25s] consonant_agent: move block B from on C to on B.  
27. [t = 26s] vowel_agent: move block A from on A to on B.  
28. [t = 27s] consonant_agent: move block C from on C to on D.  
29. [t = 28s] vowel_agent: move block A from on B to on A.  
30. [t = 29s] consonant_agent: move block B from on B to on C.  
31. [t = 30s] vowel_agent: move block A from on A to on B.

Total plan cost: 31 (unit cost per action).

Final state (goal): single stack top-to-bottom A on B on C on D on E on F on G on H on I on J with J on the table (goal reached).
