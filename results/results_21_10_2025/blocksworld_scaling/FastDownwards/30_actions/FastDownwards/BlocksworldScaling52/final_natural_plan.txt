Below is a human-readable, step-by-step rendition of the provided PDDL plan. I keep the exact action order and parameters from the plan, map each PDDL action to the responsible agent (vowel_agent for actions whose name starts with "vowel", consonant_agent for "cons"), and give a simple timestamp for each step (1.0 second per action). Each step shows what block is picked up (source) and where it is placed (destination). If the plan places a block onto the same-named block (as in the original plan), I reproduce that literal instruction exactly.

Legend:
- Vowel agent = vowel_agent (allowed: A, E, I)
- Consonant agent = consonant_agent (allowed: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K)
- Format: [step number] time interval — agent: action — "Pick up X from <source> and place it on <destination>."

1) t = 0.0s → 1.0s — vowel_agent:
   Action: vowel-move-from-block-to-block (A from J to A)
   Pick up block A from on top of J and place it on block A.

2) t = 1.0s → 2.0s — consonant_agent:
   Action: cons-move-from-block-to-block (C from B to C)
   Pick up block C from on top of B and place it on block C.

3) t = 2.0s → 3.0s — consonant_agent:
   Action: cons-move-from-block-to-block (G from D to H)
   Pick up block G from on top of D and place it on block H.

4) t = 3.0s → 4.0s — consonant_agent:
   Action: cons-move-from-block-to-block (D from I to D)
   Pick up block D from on top of I and place it on block D.

5) t = 4.0s → 5.0s — vowel_agent:
   Action: vowel-move-from-table-to-block (I from table to J)
   Pick up block I from the table and place it on block J.

6) t = 5.0s → 6.0s — consonant_agent:
   Action: cons-move-from-table-to-block (B from table to C)
   Pick up block B from the table and place it on block C.

7) t = 6.0s → 7.0s — vowel_agent:
   Action: vowel-move-from-block-to-block (A from A to B)
   Pick up block A from on top of A and place it on block B.

8) t = 7.0s → 8.0s — consonant_agent:
   Action: cons-move-from-block-to-block (G from H to G)
   Pick up block G from on top of H and place it on block G.

9) t = 8.0s → 9.0s — consonant_agent:
   Action: cons-move-from-block-to-block (H from E to I)
   Pick up block H from on top of E and place it on block I.

10) t = 9.0s → 10.0s — consonant_agent:
    Action: cons-move-from-block-to-block (G from G to H)
    Pick up block G from on top of G and place it on block H.

11) t = 10.0s → 11.0s — vowel_agent:
    Action: vowel-move-from-block-to-block (E from F to E)
    Pick up block E from on top of F and place it on block E.

12) t = 11.0s → 12.0s — consonant_agent:
    Action: cons-move-from-block-to-block (D from D to E)
    Pick up block D from on top of D and place it on block E.

13) t = 12.0s → 13.0s — consonant_agent:
    Action: cons-move-from-table-to-block (F from table to G)
    Pick up block F from the table and place it on block G.

14) t = 13.0s → 14.0s — consonant_agent:
    Action: cons-move-from-block-to-block (D from E to D)
    Pick up block D from on top of E and place it on block D.

15) t = 14.0s → 15.0s — vowel_agent:
    Action: vowel-move-from-block-to-block (E from E to F)
    Pick up block E from on top of E and place it on block F.

16) t = 15.0s → 16.0s — consonant_agent:
    Action: cons-move-from-block-to-block (D from D to E)
    Pick up block D from on top of D and place it on block E.

17) t = 16.0s → 17.0s — vowel_agent:
    Action: vowel-move-from-block-to-block (A from B to A)
    Pick up block A from on top of B and place it on block A.

18) t = 17.0s → 18.0s — consonant_agent:
    Action: cons-move-from-block-to-block (B from C to B)
    Pick up block B from on top of C and place it on block B.

19) t = 18.0s → 19.0s — vowel_agent:
    Action: vowel-move-from-block-to-block (A from A to B)
    Pick up block A from on top of A and place it on block B.

20) t = 19.0s → 20.0s — consonant_agent:
    Action: cons-move-from-block-to-block (C from C to D)
    Pick up block C from on top of C and place it on block D.

21) t = 20.0s → 21.0s — vowel_agent:
    Action: vowel-move-from-block-to-block (A from B to A)
    Pick up block A from on top of B and place it on block A.

22) t = 21.0s → 22.0s — consonant_agent:
    Action: cons-move-from-block-to-block (B from B to C)
    Pick up block B from on top of B and place it on block C.

23) t = 22.0s → 23.0s — vowel_agent:
    Action: vowel-move-from-block-to-block (A from A to B)
    Pick up block A from on top of A and place it on block B.

Summary:
- All 23 actions from the original PDDL plan are listed in order and mapped to the corresponding agent (vowel_agent or consonant_agent).
- Each action is shown with a 1-second interval timestamp and a plain-language pick/place description reflecting the plan parameters exactly.
- Final goal (as required by the specification) is to achieve the stack A on B on C on D on E on F on G on H on I on J on K with K on the table; the plan above is the PDDL solution provided for reaching that goal.
