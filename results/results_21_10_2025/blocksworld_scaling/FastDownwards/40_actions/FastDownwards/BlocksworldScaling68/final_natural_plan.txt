Assumptions: actions are executed sequentially. I report an estimated timestamp and fixed duration of 3 seconds per action (purely for readability). Timestamps start at 00:00:00 and increment by 3s per action.

15. 00:00:42 — Consonant agent puts down D onto the table.
16. 00:00:45 — Consonant agent picks up G from on B (removes G from B).
17. 00:00:48 — Consonant agent stacks G onto H (places G on H).
18. 00:00:51 — Vowel agent stacks E onto F (places E on F).
19. 00:00:54 — Vowel agent picks up A from the table.

21. 00:01:00 — Consonant agent picks up C from the table.
22. 00:01:03 — Consonant agent stacks C onto D (places C on D).
23. 00:01:06 — Vowel agent picks up A from on B (removes A from B).

28. 00:01:21 — Consonant agent picks up F from the table.
29. 00:01:24 — Consonant agent stacks F onto G (places F on G).
30. 00:01:27 — Vowel agent stacks E onto F (places E on F).
31. 00:01:30 — Vowel agent picks up A from on B (removes A from B).
32. 00:01:33 — Consonant agent picks up B from on C (removes B from C).
33. 00:01:36 — Consonant agent puts down B onto the table.
34. 00:01:39 — Consonant agent picks up C from on D (removes C from D).
35. 00:01:42 — Consonant agent puts down C onto the table.
36. 00:01:45 — Consonant agent picks up B from the table.

42. 00:02:03 — Consonant agent picks up B from on C (removes B from C).
43. 00:02:06 — Consonant agent puts down B onto the table.
44. 00:02:09 — Vowel agent stacks A onto B (places A on B).
45. 00:02:12 — Consonant agent picks up C from the table.
46. 00:02:15 — Consonant agent stacks C onto D (places C on D).
47. 00:02:18 — Vowel agent picks up A from on B (removes A from B).
48. 00:02:21 — Consonant agent picks up B from the table.
49. 00:02:24 — Consonant agent stacks B onto C (places B on C).
50. 00:02:27 — Vowel agent stacks A onto B (places A on B).

Completion: 00:02:30 (approx). Following these 50 steps, the final target stack is achieved: J on the table and, from bottom to top, J — I — H — G — F — E — D — C — B — A.
