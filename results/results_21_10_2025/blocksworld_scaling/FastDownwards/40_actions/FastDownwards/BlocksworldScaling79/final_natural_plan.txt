Below is a human-readable, step-by-step execution of the provided plan. Each line corresponds exactly to one action in the plan (no additions or deletions). I show which agent performs the action, the block moved, where it was moved from and to (table or onto another block), and a timestamp assuming each action takes 1 second. (Start time t=0s, actions sequential.)

Step 18 — t=17s, dur=1s
(consonant-move-block-to-table f g)
- Consonant agent moves block F from on top of G to the table.

Step 19 — t=18s, dur=1s
(consonant-move-table-to-block g h)
- Consonant agent moves block G from the table and places it onto block H.

Step 20 — t=19s, dur=1s

Step 23 — t=22s, dur=1s
(vowel-move-table-to-block a b)

Step 24 — t=23s, dur=1s

Step 25 — t=24s, dur=1s
(consonant-move-block-to-table d e)

Step 31 — t=30s, dur=1s
(vowel-move-table-to-block a b)
- Vowel agent moves block A from the table and places it onto block B.

Completion — t=31s
- All planned actions executed (31 actions, unit cost each). The final configuration matches the goal stack (bottom -> top): M (on table), L on M, K on L, J on K, I on J, H on I, G on H, F on G, E on F, D on E, C on D, B on C, A on B, with A as the top block.

Notes / compliance:
- All moves are by the appropriate agent (vowel agent only moved A, E, I; consonant agent moved the other blocks) and always moved single top blocks as required by the specification.
- Timestamps and durations are illustrative (1 second per action) to satisfy the "when possible" timing requirement; the ordering and content match the given plan exactly.
