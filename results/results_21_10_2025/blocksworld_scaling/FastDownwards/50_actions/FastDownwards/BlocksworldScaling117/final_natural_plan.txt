Below is a human-readable, step-by-step replay of the provided plan. Each step lists the acting agent, the block moved, the source and destination (table if applicable), and an incremental timestamp assuming each action takes 1.0 time unit. The sequence matches the plan exactly (35 actions, total cost 35).

Step 12 [t = 11.0–12.0] — vowel_agent: move a from the table to on b.
Step 13 [t = 12.0–13.0] — consonant_agent: move h from on g to on a.
Step 14 [t = 13.0–14.0] — consonant_agent: move g from on i to on h.
Step 15 [t = 14.0–15.0] — vowel_agent: move i from the table to on j.
Step 16 [t = 15.0–16.0] — consonant_agent: move g from on h to the table.
Step 17 [t = 16.0–17.0] — consonant_agent: move h from on a to on i.
Step 18 [t = 17.0–18.0] — consonant_agent: move g from the table to on h.
Step 19 [t = 18.0–19.0] — vowel_agent: move a from on b to the table.
Step 20 [t = 19.0–20.0] — consonant_agent: move b from on c to the table.
Step 21 [t = 20.0–21.0] — consonant_agent: move c from on d to the table.
Step 22 [t = 21.0–22.0] — consonant_agent: move d from on e to the table.
Step 23 [t = 22.0–23.0] — consonant_agent: move c from the table to on d.
Step 24 [t = 23.0–24.0] — consonant_agent: move b from the table to on c.
Step 25 [t = 24.0–25.0] — vowel_agent: move a from the table to on b.
Step 26 [t = 25.0–26.0] — vowel_agent: move e from on f to on a.
Step 27 [t = 26.0–27.0] — consonant_agent: move f from the table to on g.
Step 28 [t = 27.0–28.0] — vowel_agent: move e from on a to on f.
Step 29 [t = 28.0–29.0] — vowel_agent: move a from on b to the table.
Step 30 [t = 29.0–30.0] — consonant_agent: move b from on c to the table.
Step 31 [t = 30.0–31.0] — consonant_agent: move c from on d to on a.
Step 32 [t = 31.0–32.0] — consonant_agent: move d from the table to on e.
