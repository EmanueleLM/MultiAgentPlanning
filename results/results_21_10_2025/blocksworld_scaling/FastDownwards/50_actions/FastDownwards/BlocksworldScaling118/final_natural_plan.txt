Below is a step-by-step, human-readable trace of the provided PDDL plan. Each step corresponds exactly to one action in the plan (no actions added or removed). I show a simple timestamp for each action (1 second per action) and identify which agent performs it.

(End of plan — cost = 60)

Notes:
- Each "pick" is performed only by the agent allowed to manipulate that block type: vowel agent acts only on vowels (A, E, I); consonant agent acts only on consonants (H, C, K, B, D, J, L, F, G).
- Each "place" specifies the destination given in the plan (either table or another block).
- Timing is shown as a simple 1-second increment per action to provide timestamps; actual execution durations can vary.
