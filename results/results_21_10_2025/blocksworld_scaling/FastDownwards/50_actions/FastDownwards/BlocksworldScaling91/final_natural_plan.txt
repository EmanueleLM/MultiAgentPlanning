Assuming each action takes 1.0 time unit, steps start at t=0.0 and proceed sequentially. Each line below follows the plan exactly (agent, block moved, source, destination), with timestamps.

1. t=0.0–1.0: consonant_agent picks up G from on top of B.
2. t=1.0–2.0: consonant_agent places G onto H.
3. t=2.0–3.0: consonant_agent picks up B from on top of M.
4. t=3.0–4.0: consonant_agent places B on the table.
5. t=4.0–5.0: consonant_agent picks up M from on top of C.
6. t=5.0–6.0: consonant_agent places M on the table.
7. t=6.0–7.0: consonant_agent picks up B from the table.
8. t=7.0–8.0: consonant_agent places B onto C.
9. t=8.0–9.0: consonant_agent picks up G from on top of H.
10. t=9.0–10.0: consonant_agent places G on the table.
11. t=10.0–11.0: consonant_agent picks up H from on top of D.
12. t=11.0–12.0: consonant_agent places H on the table.
13. t=12.0–13.0: consonant_agent picks up D from on top of A.
14. t=13.0–14.0: vowel_agent picks up A from on top of L.
15. t=14.0–15.0: vowel_agent places A onto B.
16. t=15.0–16.0: consonant_agent places D on the table.
17. t=16.0–17.0: consonant_agent picks up L from on top of F.
18. t=17.0–18.0: consonant_agent places L onto M.
19. t=18.0–19.0: consonant_agent picks up F from on top of E.
20. t=19.0–20.0: vowel_agent picks up E from on top of I.
21. t=20.0–21.0: vowel_agent places E onto F.
22. t=21.0–22.0: consonant_agent places F onto G.
23. t=22.0–23.0: consonant_agent picks up D from the table.
24. t=23.0–24.0: consonant_agent places D onto E.
25. t=24.0–25.0: vowel_agent picks up I from on top of K.
26. t=25.0–26.0: consonant_agent picks up H from the table.
27. t=26.0–27.0: consonant_agent places H onto I.
28. t=27.0–28.0: consonant_agent picks up K from on top of J.
29. t=28.0–29.0: consonant_agent places K onto L.
30. t=29.0–30.0: consonant_agent picks up J from the table.
31. t=30.0–31.0: vowel_agent places I onto J.
32. t=31.0–32.0: consonant_agent places J onto K.
33. t=32.0–33.0: vowel_agent picks up A from on top of B.
34. t=33.0–34.0: consonant_agent picks up B from on top of C.
35. t=34.0–35.0: vowel_agent places A onto B.
36. t=35.0–36.0: consonant_agent places B on the table.
37. t=36.0–37.0: consonant_agent picks up C from the table.
38. t=37.0–38.0: consonant_agent places C onto D.
39. t=38.0–39.0: consonant_agent picks up B from the table.
40. t=39.0–40.0: consonant_agent places B onto C.

42. t=41.0–42.0: consonant_agent places F on the table.
43. t=42.0–43.0: consonant_agent picks up G from the table.
44. t=43.0–44.0: consonant_agent places G onto H.
45. t=44.0–45.0: consonant_agent picks up F from the table.
46. t=45.0–46.0: consonant_agent places F onto G.

Result (after the last action at t=46.0): the blocks are arranged into the single goal tower (top→bottom): A on B on C on D on E on F on G on H on I on J on K on L on M, with M on the table.
