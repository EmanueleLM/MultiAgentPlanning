Below is a step-by-step, human-readable rendition of the provided PDDL plan. Each step indicates the acting agent (Vowel or Consonant), the action performed, the blocks involved, and a timestamp (assuming each action takes 1 second; timestamps start at t=0s and increment by 1s). The steps follow the plan exactly and in order.

(Plan cost reported in the original plan: cost = 80.)

This sequence exactly follows the provided PDDL plan, preserves each action and actor, and is consistent with the agents’ constraints (Vowel agent moves only vowel-labeled blocks A, E, I; Consonant agent moves the others).
