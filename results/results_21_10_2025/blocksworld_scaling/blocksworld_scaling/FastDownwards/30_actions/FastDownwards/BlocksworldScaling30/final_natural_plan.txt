End of plan — total cost reported in the plan: 38 unit-cost actions.

Notes:
- Each step lists the executing agent (consonant_agent or vowel_agent) and matches exactly the action calls in the given plan.
- Timestamps are illustrative (1s per action) to show order and duration; they do not come from the PDDL plan itself.
