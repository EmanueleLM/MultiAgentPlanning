Summary: below are the 32 plan steps translated into human-readable actions. Each action lists the acting agent, the block moved, the source and destination, and an approximate timestamp assuming each action takes 1.0 time unit (start time / end time). Agents follow their constraints: vowel_agent moves only A, E, I; consonant_agent moves only consonants. The orchestrator performs no physical moves in this plan.

1) t=0.0 → 1.0 — consonant_agent unstack B from I (consonant_agent picks up block B that was on block I).  
2) t=1.0 → 2.0 — vowel_agent unstack I from G (vowel_agent picks up block I that was on block G).  
3) t=2.0 → 3.0 — vowel_agent put down I on C (vowel_agent places I onto block C).  
4) t=3.0 → 4.0 — vowel_agent unstack I from C (vowel_agent picks up block I that was on block C).  
5) t=4.0 → 5.0 — vowel_agent put down I on E (vowel_agent places I onto block E).  
6) t=5.0 → 6.0 — vowel_agent unstack I from E (vowel_agent picks up block I that was on block E).  
7) t=6.0 → 7.0 — vowel_agent put down I on J (vowel_agent places I onto block J).  
8) t=7.0 → 8.0 — vowel_agent unstack E from D (vowel_agent picks up block E that was on block D).  
9) t=8.0 → 9.0 — vowel_agent put down E on F (vowel_agent places E onto block F).  
10) t=9.0 → 10.0 — consonant_agent put down B on C (consonant_agent places B onto block C).  
11) t=10.0 → 11.0 — consonant_agent unstack C from L (consonant_agent picks up block C that was on block L).  
12) t=11.0 → 12.0 — consonant_agent put down C on D (consonant_agent places C onto block D).  
13) t=12.0 → 13.0 — consonant_agent unstack F from H (consonant_agent picks up block F that was on block H).  
14) t=13.0 → 14.0 — consonant_agent put down F on G (consonant_agent places F onto block G).  
15) t=14.0 → 15.0 — consonant_agent unstack G from M (consonant_agent picks up block G that was on block M).  
16) t=15.0 → 16.0 — consonant_agent put down G on H (consonant_agent places G onto block H).  
17) t=16.0 → 17.0 — consonant_agent unstack L from A (consonant_agent picks up block L that was on block A).  
18) t=17.0 → 18.0 — vowel_agent pickup A from table (vowel_agent picks up block A from the table).  
19) t=18.0 → 19.0 — vowel_agent put down A on B (vowel_agent places A onto block B).  
20) t=19.0 → 20.0 — consonant_agent put down L on M (consonant_agent places L onto block M).  
21) t=20.0 → 21.0 — consonant_agent unstack M from K (consonant_agent picks up block M that was on block K).  
22) t=21.0 → 22.0 — consonant_agent put down M on table (consonant_agent places M onto the table).  
23) t=22.0 → 23.0 — consonant_agent pickup D from C (consonant_agent picks up block D from block C).  
24) t=23.0 → 24.0 — consonant_agent put down D on E (consonant_agent places D onto block E).  
25) t=24.0 → 25.0 — consonant_agent pickup H from J (consonant_agent picks up block H from block J).  
26) t=25.0 → 26.0 — consonant_agent put down H on I (consonant_agent places H onto block I).  
27) t=26.0 → 27.0 — vowel_agent unstack I from J (vowel_agent picks up block I that was on block J).  
28) t=27.0 → 28.0 — vowel_agent put down I on J (vowel_agent places I onto block J).  
29) t=28.0 → 29.0 — consonant_agent pickup J from E (consonant_agent picks up block J from block E).  
30) t=29.0 → 30.0 — consonant_agent put down J on K (consonant_agent places J onto block K).  
31) t=30.0 → 31.0 — consonant_agent pickup K from table (consonant_agent picks up block K from the table).  
32) t=31.0 → 32.0 — consonant_agent put down K on L (consonant_agent places K onto block L).

Final note: after step 32 (t=32.0) the plan reaches the target single stack configuration with M on the table and A on top as specified.
