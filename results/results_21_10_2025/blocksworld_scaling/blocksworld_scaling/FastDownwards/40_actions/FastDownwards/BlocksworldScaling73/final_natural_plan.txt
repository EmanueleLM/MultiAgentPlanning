Summary: the following sequence exactly follows the provided PDDL plan. Each line shows the step number, a simple timestamp (1.0s per action), which agent performs the move, and a concise human-readable description of the action (moving the named block from the named source onto the named destination, or to the table). Total actions = 57, total time = 57.00s, cost = 57.
