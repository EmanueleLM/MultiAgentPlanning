Below is a clear, step-by-step, human-readable rendition of the provided PDDL plan. Each step matches the plan exactly (same order, same actions). I mark the executing agent (vowel_agent or consonant_agent), the block moved, the source and destination, and a short timestamp and duration for each step.

All timestamps assume a fixed duration of 5 seconds per action for readability (start — end).

Final state (goal achieved)
- After step 33 the goal chain is complete: A on B, B on C, C on D, D on E, E on F, F on G, G on H, H on I, I on J, J on K, K on L, L on M, M on N, N on O, and O on the table.

Notes:
- Each step adheres to the constraints: only the appropriate agent moved vowel or consonant blocks, only one block moved per action, and moves are top-of-stack moves as modeled in the PDDL plan.
- The timestamps are illustrative, assigning a uniform 5-second duration per action to provide a simple, consistent timeline.
