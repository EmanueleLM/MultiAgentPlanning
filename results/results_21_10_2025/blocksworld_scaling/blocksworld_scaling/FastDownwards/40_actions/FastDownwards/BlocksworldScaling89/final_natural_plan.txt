Below is a precise, step-by-step human-readable rendering of the provided PDDL plan. I keep every action in the exact order given, identify the acting agent (consonant_agent or vowel_agent), and give a simple timestamp assuming each action takes 1.0s (start time 0.0s, next action at 1.0s, etc.). Blocks are shown in uppercase for readability.

End of plan (final timestamp t=111.0s).

Notes:
- Each "pick" references the top-only constraint (agents always pick a block that was clear/top).
- Agent roles follow the specification: consonant_agent moves consonants (B,C,D,F,G,H,J,K,L,M,N) and vowel_agent moves vowels (A,E,I).
- The sequence above precisely mirrors the given PDDL plan in order and content; no actions were added or removed.
- Timestamps are a simple uniform-duration assumption (1.0s per action) to satisfy the "when possible" timing request. If you prefer different durations or wall-clock timestamps, tell me and I will reformat accordingly.
