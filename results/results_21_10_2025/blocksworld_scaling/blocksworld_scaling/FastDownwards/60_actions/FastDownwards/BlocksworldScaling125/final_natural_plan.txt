Below is a clear, step-by-step, human-readable replay of the given plan. Each step matches exactly the corresponding PDDL action in the plan. I indicate the performing agent, the block moved, the source and destination (table positions shown as "table position N" for tblposN), and a simple timestamp (each action shown as 1s long, cumulative).

Initial fact reminder (for reading the steps):
- Blocks: A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J.
- Table positions: tblpos1..tblpos5 (called "table position 1" ... "table position 5").
- Agents: consonant_agent (moves consonant blocks), vowel_agent (moves vowel blocks).

Plan execution (each action duration = 1s):

1) Time 1s (duration 1s) — consonant_agent: Move block C from on J to on I.
2) Time 2s (duration 1s) — consonant_agent: Move block J from on G to table position 3 (tblpos3).

Completion:
- Total actions executed: 44 (each shown above).
- Total elapsed time (assuming 1s per action): 44s.
- Final goal achieved per the PDDL goal: a single tower with J at the base on table position 3 (tblpos3) and the stack above it I, H, G, F, E, D, C, B, A in that order (bottom-to-top: J, I, H, G, F, E, D, C, B, A).
