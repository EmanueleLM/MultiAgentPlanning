Plan (30 steps). Timestamped at 1.0s per action (start t=0.0s). Each step names the agent (vowel_agent or consonant_agent), the block moved, the source, and the destination. This sequence exactly follows the provided plan.

1. t=0.0s — consonant_agent: Move block B from atop J to table spot t10. (duration 1.0s)  
2. t=1.0s — consonant_agent: Move block J from atop I to table spot t11. (duration 1.0s)  
3. t=2.0s — vowel_agent: Move block A from atop E onto block B. (duration 1.0s)  
4. t=3.0s — vowel_agent: Move block I from atop K onto block J. (duration 1.0s)  
5. t=4.0s — consonant_agent: Move block K from atop F to table spot t3. (duration 1.0s)  
6. t=5.0s — consonant_agent: Move block F from atop D onto block I. (duration 1.0s)  
7. t=6.0s — vowel_agent: Move block E from atop C onto block F. (duration 1.0s)  
8. t=7.0s — consonant_agent: Move block K from table spot t3 to table spot t4. (duration 1.0s)  
9. t=8.0s — vowel_agent: Move block E from atop F onto block K. (duration 1.0s)  
10. t=9.0s — consonant_agent: Move block F from atop I to table spot t3. (duration 1.0s)  
11. t=10.0s — vowel_agent: Move block I from atop J to table spot t5. (duration 1.0s)  
12. t=11.0s — vowel_agent: Move block E from atop K onto block F. (duration 1.0s)  
13. t=12.0s — consonant_agent: Move block J from table spot t11 onto block K. (duration 1.0s)  
14. t=13.0s — vowel_agent: Move block I from table spot t5 onto block J. (duration 1.0s)  
15. t=14.0s — consonant_agent: Move block D from atop H onto block E. (duration 1.0s)  
16. t=15.0s — consonant_agent: Move block C from atop G onto block D. (duration 1.0s)  
17. t=16.0s — consonant_agent: Move block H from table spot t1 onto block I. (duration 1.0s)  
18. t=17.0s — consonant_agent: Move block G from table spot t2 onto block H. (duration 1.0s)  
19. t=18.0s — consonant_agent: Move block C from atop D onto block G. (duration 1.0s)  
20. t=19.0s — consonant_agent: Move block D from atop E to table spot t1. (duration 1.0s)  
21. t=20.0s — vowel_agent: Move block E from atop F to table spot t11. (duration 1.0s)  
22. t=21.0s — consonant_agent: Move block C from atop G onto block D. (duration 1.0s)  
23. t=22.0s — consonant_agent: Move block F from table spot t3 onto block G. (duration 1.0s)  
24. t=23.0s — vowel_agent: Move block E from table spot t11 onto block F. (duration 1.0s)  
25. t=24.0s — consonant_agent: Move block C from atop D onto block A. (duration 1.0s)  
26. t=25.0s — consonant_agent: Move block D from table spot t1 onto block E. (duration 1.0s)  
27. t=26.0s — consonant_agent: Move block C from atop A onto block D. (duration 1.0s)  
28. t=27.0s — vowel_agent: Move block A from atop B to table spot t1. (duration 1.0s)  
29. t=28.0s — consonant_agent: Move block B from table spot t10 onto block C. (duration 1.0s)  
30. t=29.0s — vowel_agent: Move block A from table spot t1 onto block B. (duration 1.0s)

Total cost: 30 (30 unit-cost moves). Final configuration matches the goal: A on B, B on C, C on D, D on E, E on F, F on G, G on H, H on I, I on J, J on K, and K on table spot t4.
