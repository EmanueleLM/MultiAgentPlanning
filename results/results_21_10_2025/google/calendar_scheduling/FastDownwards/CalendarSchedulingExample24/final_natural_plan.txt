Step 1 — Schedule the meeting:
- Action: Schedule a 30-minute meeting on Monday.
- Start time: 09:00 (slot0900)
- Duration: 30 minutes (09:00–09:30)
- Participants: Benjamin, Hannah, Brenda
- Rationale: All three participants are available for the 09:00 start; this respects Benjamin’s preference not to meet after 09:30 and fits Brenda’s and Hannah’s availabilities.
- Result: Meeting scheduled (goal satisfied).
