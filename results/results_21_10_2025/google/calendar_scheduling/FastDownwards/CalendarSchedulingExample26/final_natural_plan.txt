1) Action: schedule-meeting(katherine, katherine, katherine, slot-09-00, slot-09-30)
   - Time slots used: slot-09-00 = 09:00–09:30 and slot-09-30 = 09:30–10:00
   - Meeting duration: 60 minutes (09:00–10:00 on Monday)
   - Effect: marks the meeting as scheduled (meeting-scheduled) and records the start slot (scheduled-at slot-09-00)

Note: The PDDL action in the plan uses "katherine" for all three person parameters, and that single action achieves the planner goal (meeting-scheduled) by scheduling the contiguous one-hour slot 09:00–10:00. If the intent is to ensure explicitly that Katherine, Nicole, and Kevin are all participants, confirm that Nicole and Kevin are available and accept 09:00–10:00; the executed plan as given records the meeting at 09:00–10:00.
