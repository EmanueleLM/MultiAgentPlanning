   - Effect: day11 is used/allocated to Dubrovnik; need_d3 is satisfied.
   - Timestamp: Day 11.

4) Allocate Day 2 (day2) to Dubrovnik to satisfy need_d4.

9) Allocate Day 5 (day5) to Venice to satisfy need_v1.
   - Effect: day5 is used/allocated to Venice; need_v1 is satisfied; Venice is marked visited.
   - Timestamp: Day 5.

10) Allocate Day 6 (day6) to Venice to satisfy need_v2.
    - Effect: day6 is used/allocated to Venice; need_v2 is satisfied.
    - Timestamp: Day 6.

11) Allocate Day 7 (day7) to Venice to satisfy need_v3.
    - Effect: day7 is used/allocated to Venice; need_v3 is satisfied.
    - Timestamp: Day 7.

12) Allocate Day 8 (day8) to Venice to satisfy need_v4.
    - Effect: day8 is used/allocated to Venice; need_v4 is satisfied.
    - Timestamp: Day 8.

13) Allocate Day 9 (day9) to Venice to satisfy need_v5.
    - Effect: day9 is used/allocated to Venice; need_v5 is satisfied.
    - Timestamp: Day 9.

Final summary:
- All 11 day tokens (day1..day11) have been used/allocated across the plan.
- Needs satisfied by city: Dubrovnik 4 needs (day1, day2, day10, day11), Istanbul 2 needs (day3, day4), Venice 5 needs (day5–day9). Total days allocated = 4 + 2 + 5 = 11.
- All three cities (Dubrovnik, Istanbul, Venice) are visited as required.
