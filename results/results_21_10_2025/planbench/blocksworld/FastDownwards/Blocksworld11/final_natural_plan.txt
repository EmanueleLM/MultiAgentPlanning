Initial state (t = 0)
- on(blue, yellow)
- ontable(yellow)
- ontable(red)
- ontable(orange)
- clear(blue)
- clear(red)
- clear(orange)
- handempty

Plan cost: 4 unit actions. Each action is 1 time unit. Actions executed in sequence.

Step 1 — t = 0 → 1
Action: Unstack blue from yellow
- Preconditions checked: on(blue, yellow) (true), clear(blue) (true), handempty (true) — all satisfied.
- Effects applied:
  - remove on(blue, yellow)
  - remove clear(blue)
  - remove handempty
  - add holding(blue)
  - add clear(yellow)
State after step 1:
- holding(blue)
- ontable(yellow)
- ontable(red)
- ontable(orange)
- clear(yellow)
- clear(red)
- clear(orange)
- (blue is not clear, not on yellow, not on table)
- hand not empty

Step 2 — t = 1 → 2
Action: Stack blue onto orange
- Preconditions checked: holding(blue) (true), clear(orange) (true) — satisfied.
- Effects applied:
  - remove holding(blue)
  - remove clear(orange)
  - add on(blue, orange)
  - add clear(blue)
  - add handempty
State after step 2:
- on(blue, orange)
- ontable(yellow)
- ontable(red)
- clear(blue)
- clear(yellow)
- (orange is not clear)
- clear(red)
- handempty

Step 3 — t = 2 → 3
Action: Pick up yellow (from the table)
- Preconditions checked: ontable(yellow) (true), clear(yellow) (true), handempty (true) — satisfied.
- Effects applied:
  - remove ontable(yellow)
  - remove clear(yellow)
  - remove handempty
  - add holding(yellow)
State after step 3:
- holding(yellow)
- on(blue, orange)
- ontable(red)
- (yellow not on table, not clear while held)
- clear(blue)
- clear(red)
- (hand not empty)

Step 4 — t = 3 → 4
Action: Stack yellow onto red
- Preconditions checked: holding(yellow) (true), clear(red) (true) — satisfied.
- Effects applied:
  - remove holding(yellow)
  - remove clear(red)
  - add on(yellow, red)
  - add clear(yellow)
  - add handempty
State after step 4 (t = 4):
- on(blue, orange)
- on(yellow, red)
- ontable(red) — unchanged (red remains on table)
- clear(blue)
- clear(yellow)
- (orange and red are not clear)
- handempty

Final check (goals)
- on(blue, orange) — true
- on(yellow, red) — true

Total duration: 4 time units. Total cost: 4 (unit cost per action).
All steps obey the action restrictions and preconditions from the specification.
