Summary of initial state (given)
- Blocks: orange, yellow, blue, red
- Facts: orange on blue; yellow on red; blue on table; red on table
- Clear: orange, yellow
- Hand: empty
- Goal: place red on top of blue (i.e., (on red blue))

Timing convention / assumption
- Each action is 1 time unit (unit cost). Start time t=0. Cumulative timestamps use [start, end).

Planned action sequence (matches provided plan exactly; 6 actions, total cost = 6)

1) t = [0, 1) — unstack orange from blue
   - Action: unstack(orange, blue)
   - Preconditions checked: (on orange blue), (clear orange), (handempty)
   - Effects applied: remove (on orange blue); set (holding orange); clear becomes false for orange; set (clear blue) true; hand no longer empty.
   - State notes after action: holding orange; blue is clear.

2) t = [1, 2) — put down orange (onto table)
   - Action: putdown(orange)
   - Preconditions checked: (holding orange)
   - Effects applied: set (ontable orange); set (clear orange); set (handempty); remove (holding orange)
   - State notes after action: orange is on table and clear; hand empty.

3) t = [2, 3) — unstack yellow from red
   - Action: unstack(yellow, red)
   - Preconditions checked: (on yellow red), (clear yellow), (handempty)
   - Effects applied: remove (on yellow red); set (holding yellow); clear becomes false for yellow; set (clear red) true; hand no longer empty.
   - State notes after action: holding yellow; red is clear.

4) t = [3, 4) — put down yellow (onto table)
   - Action: putdown(yellow)
   - Preconditions checked: (holding yellow)
   - Effects applied: set (ontable yellow); set (clear yellow); set (handempty); remove (holding yellow)
   - State notes after action: yellow is on table and clear; hand empty.

5) t = [4, 5) — pick up red from the table
   - Action: pickup(red)
   - Preconditions checked: (ontable red), (clear red), (handempty)
   - Effects applied: remove (ontable red); set (holding red); clear becomes false for red; set hand to not empty.
   - State notes after action: holding red.

6) t = [5, 6) — stack red on top of blue
   - Action: stack(red, blue)
   - Preconditions checked: (holding red), (clear blue)
   - Effects applied: set (on red blue); set (clear red); remove (clear blue); set (handempty); remove (holding red)
   - State notes after action: red is on blue.

Final state and verification
- Result: (on red blue) is true — goal achieved.
- Total plan cost (unit cost per action): 6
- Final hand state: empty

Notes / assumptions
- "Put down" is interpreted as placing the block onto the table (ontable).
- Each action treated as atomic and taking 1 time unit (this matches the unit-cost plan cost = 6).
