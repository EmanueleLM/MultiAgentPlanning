Action sequence (matches the given plan exactly). Each action is 1 time unit long; timeline starts at t=0. Total cost = 2.

1) t = 0.0 → 1.0 — pick-up yellow
   - Description: Pick up the yellow block from the table.
   - Required preconditions (satisfied in the initial state): yellow is on the table, yellow is clear, hand is empty.
   - Effects after execution: you are holding yellow; yellow is no longer on the table; yellow is not clear; your hand is no longer empty.

2) t = 1.0 → 2.0 — stack yellow orange
   - Description: Place the held yellow block onto the orange block.
   - Required preconditions (satisfied at t=1.0): you are holding yellow; orange is clear.
   - Effects after execution: yellow is on orange; orange is no longer clear; yellow becomes clear; you are no longer holding anything (hand becomes empty).

Result after t = 2.0:
- Goal achieved: blue is on red (already true initially) and yellow is on orange (established by step 2).
- Hand is empty.
