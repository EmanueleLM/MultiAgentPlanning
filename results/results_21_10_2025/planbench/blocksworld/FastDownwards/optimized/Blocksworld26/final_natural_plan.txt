Final note: This sequence follows the provided plan exactly (112 actions). The timestamps are given as 1-second increments for readability; each step indicates the acting agent, the concrete block move, and the immediate state effect (holding/clear/ontable/stacked). The final arrangement satisfies the goal ordering A on B on C on D on E on F on G on H on I on J on K on L on M on N with N on the table.
