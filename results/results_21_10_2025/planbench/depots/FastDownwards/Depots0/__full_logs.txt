PROBLEM
------------------------------
I am playing with a set of objects. Here are the actions I can do

Paltry object_0 object_1 object_2.

I have the following restrictions on my actions:
To perform paltry action, the following facts need to be true: hand object_0, cats object_1, texture object_2, vase object_0 object_1, and next object_1 object_2
Once paltry is performed the following facts will be true: next object_0 object_2

NATURAL-PLAN sas_plan_2
------------------------------
Below is a clear, step-by-step human-readable rendering of the provided plan. Each step shows the bound parameters, required preconditions and which facts satisfied them (from the initial state or from effects of earlier steps), the effects produced or deleted by the step, an approximate timestamp/duration, and any verification notes. The sequence matches the plan exactly (no actions added or removed). The final goal (next object_8 object_6) is achieved at the end.

Initial facts used (from the chosen initial state):
- cats object_0, cats object_1
- collect object_6 object_2, collect object_7 object_3
- hand object_8
- next object_0 object_6, next object_1 object_6, next object_4 object_6, next object_5 object_7, next object_8 object_7
- sneeze object_4, sneeze object_5
- spring object_6, spring object_7
- stupendous object_2, stupendous object_3
- texture object_6, texture object_7

Plan (4 steps, unit cost = 4):

Step 1 — (memory object_1 object_6 object_7)
- Timestamp: 00:00:00 (duration ~1s)
- Parameters: ?o0=object_1, ?o1=object_6, ?o2=object_7
- Action preconditions (memory):
  1. cats object_1 — satisfied by initial fact (cats object_1)
  2. spring object_6 — satisfied by initial fact (spring object_6)
  3. spring object_7 — satisfied by initial fact (spring object_7)
  4. next object_1 object_6 — satisfied by initial fact (next object_1 object_6)
- Effects:
  - Adds: next object_1 object_7
  - Deletes: next object_1 object_6
- Verification notes: All preconditions are present in the initial state. After this step the state no longer has next object_1 object_6 but has next object_1 object_7.

Step 2 — (sip object_8 object_1 object_7)
- Timestamp: 00:00:01 (duration ~1s)
- Parameters: ?o0=object_8, ?o1=object_1, ?o2=object_7
- Action preconditions (sip):
  1. hand object_8 — satisfied by initial fact (hand object_8)
  2. cats object_1 — satisfied by initial fact (cats object_1)
  3. texture object_7 — satisfied by initial fact (texture object_7)
  4. next object_8 object_7 — satisfied by initial fact (next object_8 object_7)
  5. next object_1 object_7 — satisfied by effect of Step 1 (next object_1 object_7)
- Effects:
  - Adds: vase object_8 object_1
  - Deletes: next object_8 object_7
- Verification notes: All required preconditions are satisfied (some by initial facts, one by Step 1). After this step the state has vase object_8 object_1 and no longer has next object_8 object_7.

Step 3 — (memory object_1 object_7 object_6)
- Timestamp: 00:00:02 (duration ~1s)
- Parameters: ?o0=object_1, ?o1=object_7, ?o2=object_6
- Action preconditions (memory):
  1. cats object_1 — satisfied by initial fact (cats object_1)
  2. spring object_7 — satisfied by initial fact (spring object_7)
  3. spring object_6 — satisfied by initial fact (spring object_6)
  4. next object_1 object_7 — satisfied by the effect of Step 1 (and still present because Step 2 did not delete it)
- Effects:
  - Adds: next object_1 object_6
  - Deletes: next object_1 object_7
- Verification notes: Preconditions satisfied. This re-establishes next object_1 object_6 and removes next object_1 object_7.

Step 4 — (paltry object_8 object_1 object_6)
- Timestamp: 00:00:03 (duration ~1s)
- Parameters: ?o0=object_8, ?o1=object_1, ?o2=object_6
- Action preconditions (paltry):
  1. hand object_8 — satisfied by initial fact (hand object_8)
  2. cats object_1 — satisfied by initial fact (cats object_1)
  3. texture object_6 — satisfied by initial fact (texture object_6)
  4. vase object_8 object_1 — satisfied by effect of Step 2 (vase object_8 object_1)
  5. next object_1 object_6 — satisfied by effect of Step 3 (next object_1 object_6)
- Effects:
  - Adds: next object_8 object_6
  - Deletes: vase object_8 object_1
- Verification notes: All preconditions are satisfied (some originated in the initial state, some from prior steps). The action produces next object_8 object_6 and removes vase object_8 object_1.

Final state relevant facts (after Step 4):
- next object_8 object_6 — ADDED by Step 4 (this meets the planning goal)
- next object_1 object_6 — present (re-added by Step 3)
- vase object_8 object_1 — deleted by Step 4
- other initial facts unchanged unless explicitly deleted above

Conclusion
- The provided sequence of four actions exactly matches the plan and is compliant with the domain/action precondition/effect definitions and the chosen initial state.
- Every action’s preconditions are satisfied at the time it is executed (some by the initial state, some by effects of earlier actions). No missing facts or ambiguous references prevent verification.
- The final goal next object_8 object_6 is achieved at the end of Step 4 (timestamp ~00:00:03).
- Plan cost: 4 (unit cost per action).
