Plan (human-readable, step-by-step). Each step lists a timestamp (integer time steps, 1.0 unit each), the action as in the plan, the three- or four-argument grounding, and a short plain-English description of the effect (what predicate is added and what predicate is deleted).

t = 0.0 — Step 1
Action: clip object_11 object_4 object_6
Description: Perform clip with actor object_11, sneeze object_4, texture object_6. Effect: add (vase object_11 object_4); delete (next object_11 object_6).

t = 1.0 — Step 2
Action: wretched object_4 object_6 object_8 object_2
Description: Perform wretched with sneeze object_4, textures object_6 and object_8, stupendous object_2. Effect: add (next object_4 object_8); delete (next object_4 object_6).

t = 2.0 — Step 3
Action: clip object_10 object_4 object_8
Description: Perform clip with actor object_10, sneeze object_4, texture object_8. Effect: add (vase object_10 object_4); delete (next object_10 object_8).

t = 3.0 — Step 4
Action: tightfisted object_10 object_4 object_7
Description: Perform tightfisted with actor object_10, sneeze object_4, texture object_7. Effect: add (next object_10 object_7); delete (vase object_10 object_4).

t = 4.0 — Step 5
Action: tightfisted object_11 object_4 object_7
Description: Perform tightfisted with actor object_11, sneeze object_4, texture object_7. Effect: add (next object_11 object_7); delete (vase object_11 object_4).

t = 5.0 — Step 6
Action: sip object_9 object_0 object_5
Description: Perform sip with actor object_9, cats object_0, texture object_5. Effect: add (vase object_9 object_0); delete (next object_9 object_5).

t = 6.0 — Step 7
Action: memory object_0 object_8 object_7
Description: Perform memory with cats object_0, spring object_8, spring object_7. Effect: add (next object_0 object_7); delete (next object_0 object_8).

t = 7.0 — Step 8
Action: paltry object_9 object_0 object_7
Description: Perform paltry with actor object_9, cats object_0, texture object_7. Effect: add (next object_9 object_7); delete (vase object_9 object_0).

t = 8.0 — Step 9
Action: wretched object_4 object_8 object_9 object_3
Description: Perform wretched with sneeze object_4, textures object_8 and object_9, stupendous object_3. Effect: add (next object_4 object_9); delete (next object_4 object_8).

t = 9.0 — Step 10
Action: wretched object_4 object_7 object_8 object_2
Description: Perform wretched with sneeze object_4, textures object_7 and object_8, stupendous object_2. Effect: add (next object_4 object_8); delete (next object_4 object_7).

t = 10.0 — Step 11
Action: clip object_11 object_4 object_9
Description: Perform clip with actor object_11, sneeze object_4, texture object_9. Effect: add (vase object_11 object_4); delete (next object_11 object_9).

t = 11.0 — Step 12
Action: tightfisted object_11 object_4 object_8
Description: Perform tightfisted with actor object_11, sneeze object_4, texture object_8. Effect: add (next object_11 object_8); delete (vase object_11 object_4).

Final check (after t = 11.0):
- Goal predicates required:
  - (next object_10 object_7) — produced at t = 3.0 (Step 4).
  - (next object_11 object_8) — produced at t = 11.0 (Step 12).
  - (next object_11 object_7) — produced at t = 4.0 (Step 5).
  - (next object_9 object_7) — produced at t = 7.0 (Step 8).
All required goal facts are present in the final state, so the plan achieves the goal.
