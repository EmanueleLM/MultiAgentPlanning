Below is a clear, step-by-step, human-readable trace of the provided plan. Each step lists:
- the grounded action (as in the plan),
- a short English description,
- the required preconditions and whether they were satisfied at that moment,
- the effects (facts added and facts deleted),
- the resulting immediate state changes relevant to the goal predicates.
Each action is shown at an integer timestamp (each action takes 1 time unit for readability). All steps are exactly the actions from the plan and in the same order.

Initial state (t = 0, before any action)
- cats: (object_0)
- collect: (object_5,object_1), (object_6,object_1), (object_7,object_2), (object_8,object_2)
- hand: object_10, object_11, object_9
- next: (object_0,object_5), (object_10,object_8), (object_11,object_6), (object_3,object_5), (object_4,object_7), (object_9,object_5)
- sneeze: object_3, object_4
- spring: object_5, object_7
- stupendous: object_1, object_2
- texture: object_5, object_6, object_7, object_8
- vase: none initially

Plan execution (each step occupies 1 time unit):

Step 1 — t = 0..1
Action: (wretched object_4 object_7 object_8 object_2)

  - stupendous(object_2): YES
  - next(object_4,object_7): YES

Final state highlights (after Step 13, t = 13)
- Goal predicates achieved:
  - next(object_10,object_7): YES (created in Step 4)
  - next(object_11,object_7): YES (created in Step 13)
  - next(object_9,object_7): YES (created in Step 12)
- All planned actions were applicable when executed and their effects were applied exactly as above.
- Plan cost: 13 unit steps (as given in the original plan).

Summary statement
- The provided 13-step plan is executable from the given Scenario 1 initial state. Each action's preconditions were satisfied at its execution time, and the effects produced the stated changes. The final goal (next object_10 object_7, next object_11 object_7, next object_9 object_7) is achieved at t = 13.
