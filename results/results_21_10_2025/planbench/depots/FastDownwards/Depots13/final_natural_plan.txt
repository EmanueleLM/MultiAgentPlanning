Below is a human-readable, step-by-step execution of the provided plan. Each step is numbered and timestamped (1 unit per action). For each action I list:
- The grounded action and a short natural-language description,
- Its grounded preconditions and where each precondition came from (initial facts or which prior step produced it),
- The grounded effects and the state change applied.

All actions match the given plan in order and no actions were added or removed. Total steps: 19. Final goal (next object_10 object_7, next object_11 object_9, next object_12 object_8) is achieved at the end.

Goal verification

Timing/duration note
- Each action is shown with a discrete timestamp (Time 1 .. Time 19). If you prefer absolute timestamps or different action durations, multiply these units accordingly (e.g., 1 time unit = 1s).

If you want, I can:
- produce a compact table of preconditions/effects per step,
- or output a trace of the predicate set after each step,
- or create the per-agent analyses (which initial facts supported each action) used to verify the plan.
