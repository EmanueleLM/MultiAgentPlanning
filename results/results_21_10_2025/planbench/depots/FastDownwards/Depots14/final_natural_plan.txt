Plan execution (human-readable, step-by-step). Each step follows the provided plan exactly. I report a simple timestamp (one time unit per step) and a duration of 1 time unit per action. For each step I list the action, the preconditions and whether they were satisfied at execution time, and the state updates (added and deleted facts).

Initial relevant facts (from the problem) used to check preconditions:
- cats: object_0, object_1
- collect: (object_6,object_2), (object_7,object_2), (object_8,object_3), (object_9,object_3)
- hand: object_10, object_11, object_12
- next: (object_0,object_8), (object_1,object_6), (object_10,object_8), (object_11,object_9), (object_12,object_6), (object_4,object_6), (object_5,object_9)
- sneeze: object_4, object_5

- next(object_11, object_7) — added in Step 14
- next(object_12, object_7) — added in Step 13

Goal check:
- Goal required: (next object_10 object_7), (next object_11 object_7), (next object_12 object_7).
- All three goal facts are present in the final state. Goal is satisfied.

Summary:
- All 15 actions in the supplied plan were executed in order.
- For each step, all required preconditions were satisfied at the moment of execution.
- The cumulative effects produced the three requested next links and thus achieved the scenario goal by time 15.0 (end of Step 15).
- Total plan duration (as reported here): 15 time units (each action duration assumed 1 unit).
