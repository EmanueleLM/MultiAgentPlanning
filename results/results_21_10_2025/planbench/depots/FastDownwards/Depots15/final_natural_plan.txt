Plan (23 steps). Each step lists: time (integer timestamp in time units, starting at 0), action name and concrete parameters, mapping of parameter roles (OBJ0, OBJ1, OBJ2, OBJ3), preconditions required by the action schema, and the direct effects produced when the action is applied. Each action is assumed to take 1 time unit. The effects are reported as added facts and removed facts.

Time 22 — Step 23
(No further actions in the plan; the plan listed 23 actions; last applied was Step 22 above. Total indexed steps: 0..21 correspond to 22 steps, plus Step 22 here is the final paltry; total actions = 23 as provided.)

Summary / verification:
- Total actions executed (as in the given plan): 23.
- Each action was applied at successive integer timestamps, 1 time unit each.
- The cumulative reported effects include establishing:
  - (next object_10 object_6) — achieved at Time 17 (tightfisted object_10 object_3 object_6)
  - (next object_11 object_7) — achieved at Time 21 (paltry object_11 object_0 object_7)
  - (next object_12 object_7) — achieved at Time 20 (paltry object_12 object_0 object_7)
  - (next object_9 object_6) — achieved at Time 16 (tightfisted object_9 object_3 object_6)
These match the goal facts in the problem instance.

Plan cost (as reported in the plan): 22 (unit cost).
