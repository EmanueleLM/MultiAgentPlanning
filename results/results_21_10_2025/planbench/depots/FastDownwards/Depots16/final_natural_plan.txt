Plan (4 steps). Each step duration: 1 time unit. Start times shown in brackets.

1) [t=0 → t=1] analyzera_pick object_0 object_6 object_2
   - Description: Agent object_0 picks up item object_6 at location object_2.
   - Preconditions (satisfied): object_0 is at object_2; item object_6 is at object_2; object_0 has a hand.
   - Effects: object_0 is now holding object_6; object_6 is no longer at location object_2.

2) [t=1 → t=2] analyzera_assemble object_0 object_6 object_6 object_8 object_2 object_10
   - Description: Agent object_0 assembles output item object_10 at location object_2 using part p1=object_6 and part p2=object_6 (same part supplied for both inputs) and tool object_8 located at object_2.
   - Preconditions (satisfied): object_0 is at object_2; object_0 is holding object_6 (used as both p1 and p2); tool object_8 is at object_2; object_10 is not yet assembled.
   - Effects: object_10 becomes assembled and is placed at location object_2; object_0 is no longer holding object_6 (the used parts are removed from the agent's hands).

3) [t=2 → t=3] analyzerb_inspect object_0 object_10 object_8 object_2
   - Description: Agent object_0 inspects assembled item object_10 at location object_2 using tool object_8.
   - Preconditions (satisfied): object_0 is at object_2; object_10 is assembled and at object_2; tool object_8 is at object_2; object_10 is not already inspected.
   - Effects: object_10 is marked inspected.

4) [t=3 → t=4] analyzerb_activate object_0 object_10 object_13 object_8 object_2
   - Description: Agent object_0 activates/powers item object_13 (the power unit) at location object_2 using tool object_8 and the inspected/assembled device object_10.
   - Preconditions (satisfied): object_0 is at object_2; object_10 is assembled and inspected and at object_2; object_13 (power unit) is at object_2; tool object_8 is at object_2; object_13 is not already powered.
   - Effects: object_13 becomes powered.

Final state (after t=4):
- assembled object_10 (goal satisfied)
- powered object_13 (goal satisfied)

Notes:
- The action sequence exactly follows the provided plan and reaches the stated goals.
- Step 2 uses the same part (object_6) as both inputs to the assemble action (p1 and p2). This mirrors the plan parameters as given.
