Plan execution (timestamps in time units; each action takes 1 time unit). The sequence below follows the provided plan exactly (12 actions, total time 12). For each step I name the action and its parameters, state the immediate effects (predicates added and predicates deleted) in terms of the domain relations.

Time 0 — Step 1
Action: clip(object_11, object_5, object_9)
Description: Using hand object_11 and sneeze object_5 on texture object_9.
Effects:
- Add: (vase object_11 object_5)
- Delete: (next object_11 object_9)

Time 1 — Step 2
Action: wretched(object_5, object_9, object_8, object_3)
Description: With sneeze object_5, textures object_9 and object_8, stupendous object_3, and collects linking object_9 & object_3 and object_8 & object_3.
Effects:
- Add: (next object_5 object_8)
- Delete: (next object_5 object_9)

Time 2 — Step 3
Action: tightfisted(object_11, object_5, object_8)
Description: With hand object_11 and sneeze object_5 on texture object_8, consuming vase(object_11,object_5).
Effects:
- Add: (next object_11 object_8)
- Delete: (vase object_11 object_5)

Time 3 — Step 4
Action: clip(object_10, object_4, object_7)
Description: Using hand object_10 and sneeze object_4 on texture object_7.
Effects:
- Add: (vase object_10 object_4)
- Delete: (next object_10 object_7)

Time 4 — Step 5
Action: sip(object_12, object_1, object_8)
Description: Using hand object_12, cats object_1 and texture object_8; combines next(object_12,object_8) and next(object_1,object_8).
Effects:
- Add: (vase object_12 object_1)
- Delete: (next object_12 object_8)

Time 5 — Step 6
Action: memory(object_1, object_8, object_6)
Description: With cats object_1 and springs object_8 & object_6, transforming next(object_1,object_8) into next(object_1,object_6).
Effects:
- Add: (next object_1 object_6)
- Delete: (next object_1 object_8)

Time 6 — Step 7
Action: wretched(object_4, object_7, object_6, object_2)
Description: With sneeze object_4, textures object_7 & object_6, stupendous object_2, and collects linking object_7 & object_2 and object_6 & object_2.
Effects:
- Add: (next object_4 object_6)
- Delete: (next object_4 object_7)

Time 7 — Step 8
Action: tightfisted(object_10, object_4, object_6)
Description: Using hand object_10, sneeze object_4 and texture object_6, consuming vase(object_10,object_4) and the newly created next(object_4,object_6).
Effects:
- Add: (next object_10 object_6)
- Delete: (vase object_10 object_4)

Time 8 — Step 9
Action: paltry(object_12, object_1, object_6)
Description: With hand object_12, cats object_1 and texture object_6, consuming vase(object_12,object_1) and next(object_1,object_6) to create a new next link.
Effects:
- Add: (next object_12 object_6)
- Delete: (vase object_12 object_1)

Time 9 — Step 10
Action: clip(object_12, object_4, object_6)
Description: Using hand object_12 and sneeze object_4 on texture object_6, with both next(object_4,object_6) and next(object_12,object_6) present.
Effects:
- Add: (vase object_12 object_4)
- Delete: (next object_12 object_6)

Time 10 — Step 11
Action: wretched(object_4, object_6, object_7, object_2)
Description: With sneeze object_4, textures object_6 & object_7, stupendous object_2, and collect links for object_6 & object_2 and object_7 & object_2; transforms next(object_4,object_6) back to next(object_4,object_7).
Effects:
- Add: (next object_4 object_7)
- Delete: (next object_4 object_6)

Time 11 — Step 12
Action: tightfisted(object_12, object_4, object_7)
Description: Using hand object_12 and sneeze object_4 on texture object_7, consuming the vase created in step 10 and the restored next(object_4,object_7).
Effects:
- Add: (next object_12 object_7)
- Delete: (vase object_12 object_4)

Final state summary (relevant next relations)
- (next object_10 object_6) — created at time 7 (Step 8)
- (next object_11 object_8) — created at time 2 (Step 3)
- (next object_12 object_7) — created at time 11 (Step 12)
- (next object_13 object_9) — was present in the initial state and never deleted

Goal check
The goal required:
- (next object_10 object_6)
- (next object_11 object_8)
- (next object_12 object_7)
- (next object_13 object_9)

All four required next relations are present after executing the 12 actions above. Plan successful. (Total cost/time: 12 unit steps.)
