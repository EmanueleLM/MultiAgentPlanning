Plan trace (steps follow the given plan exactly). I assign each step a 1-unit duration and sequential timestamps for clarity.

Initial relevant facts (from the problem):
- cats(object_0)
- collect(object_5,object_1)
- collect(object_6,object_2)
- hand(object_7), hand(object_8)
- next(object_0,object_6)
- next(object_3,object_5)
- next(object_4,object_6)
- next(object_7,object_6)
- next(object_8,object_5)
- sneeze(object_3), sneeze(object_4)
- spring(object_5), spring(object_6)
- stupendous(object_1), stupendous(object_2)
- texture(object_5), texture(object_6)

Goal to satisfy:
- next(object_7,object_6)
- next(object_8,object_6)

Step 1 — t = 0 → 1 (duration 1)
Action: memory(object_0, object_6, object_5)
- Intended meaning: move the "next" relation for object_0 from object_6 to object_5.
- Preconditions required:
  - cats(object_0) — present in initial state
  - spring(object_6) — present in initial state
  - spring(object_5) — present in initial state
  - next(object_0, object_6) — present in initial state
  => All preconditions satisfied.
- Effects:
  - Add: next(object_0, object_5)
  - Delete: next(object_0, object_6)
- State change summary: next(0,5) becomes true; next(0,6) becomes false.

Step 2 — t = 1 → 2 (duration 1)
Action: sip(object_8, object_0, object_5)
- Intended meaning: create vase(object_8,object_0) by consuming the next relation from object_8 to object_5.
- Preconditions required:
  - hand(object_8) — present in initial state
  - cats(object_0) — present in initial state
  - texture(object_5) — present in initial state
  - next(object_8, object_5) — present in initial state
  - next(object_0, object_5) — made true by Step 1
  => All preconditions satisfied.
- Effects:
  - Add: vase(object_8, object_0)
  - Delete: next(object_8, object_5)
- State change summary: vase(8,0) becomes true; next(8,5) becomes false.

Step 3 — t = 2 → 3 (duration 1)
Action: memory(object_0, object_5, object_6)
- Intended meaning: move the "next" relation for object_0 from object_5 back to object_6.
- Preconditions required:
  - cats(object_0) — present
  - spring(object_5) — present
  - spring(object_6) — present
  - next(object_0, object_5) — true after Step 1 and still true after Step 2
  => All preconditions satisfied.
- Effects:
  - Add: next(object_0, object_6)
  - Delete: next(object_0, object_5)
- State change summary: next(0,6) becomes true again; next(0,5) becomes false.

Step 4 — t = 3 → 4 (duration 1)
Action: paltry(object_8, object_0, object_6)
- Intended meaning: using vase(object_8,object_0) and next(object_0,object_6) produce next(object_8,object_6) and consume the vase.
- Preconditions required:
  - hand(object_8) — present
  - cats(object_0) — present
  - texture(object_6) — present in initial state
  - vase(object_8, object_0) — introduced by Step 2
  - next(object_1=object_0, object_2=object_6) i.e. next(object_0, object_6) — restored by Step 3
  => All preconditions satisfied.
- Effects:
  - Add: next(object_8, object_6)
  - Delete: vase(object_8, object_0)
- State change summary: next(8,6) becomes true; vase(8,0) removed.

Final relevant facts (after all steps)
- next(object_7, object_6) — unchanged from initial, still true
- next(object_8, object_6) — made true in Step 4
=> Both goal conditions are satisfied.

Plan cost: 4 actions (unit cost per action as given).

Notes:
- All preconditions are satisfied at the time each action is applied; no step is inapplicable.
- The plan strictly follows the given sequence and produces the required final facts.
