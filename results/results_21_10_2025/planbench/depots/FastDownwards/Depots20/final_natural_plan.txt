Context / goal
- Problem: Statement A (objects object_0 .. object_11).
- Initial goal: make (next object_11 object_9) true.
- Initial relevant facts (excerpt):
  - hand: object_11
  - sneeze: object_3, object_4
  - texture: object_10, object_5, object_6, object_7, object_8, object_9
  - next: (object_0 object_5), (object_11 object_8), (object_3 object_5), (object_4 object_10)
  - collect: (object_10 object_2), (object_5 object_1), (object_6 object_1), (object_7 object_1), (object_8 object_2), (object_9 object_2)
  - spring: object_5, object_8
  - stupendous: object_1, object_2

Plan (4 steps). For timing, each action is listed with a 1.0 time-unit duration and timestamps are cumulative (start at t = 0.0).

Step 1 — t = 0.0 .. 1.0
- Action: wretched object_4 object_10 object_8 object_2
- Parameters mapping: ?o0=object_4, ?o1=object_10, ?o2=object_8, ?o3=object_2
- Preconditions (checked against initial state):
  - (sneeze object_4) — true
  - (texture object_10) — true
  - (texture object_8) — true
  - (stupendous object_2) — true
  - (next object_4 object_10) — true
  - (collect object_10 object_2) — true
  - (collect object_8 object_2) — true
  => All preconditions satisfied.
- Effects (applied at completion of the action):
  - Add: (next object_4 object_8)
  - Remove: (next object_4 object_10)
- State change summary after Step 1:
  - next: (object_4 object_10) removed; (object_4 object_8) added.
  - (next object_11 object_8) remains from initial state.

Step 2 — t = 1.0 .. 2.0
- Action: clip object_11 object_4 object_8
- Parameters: ?o0=object_11, ?o1=object_4, ?o2=object_8
- Preconditions (checked against state after Step 1):
  - (hand object_11) — true
  - (sneeze object_4) — true
  - (texture object_8) — true
  - (next object_4 object_8) — true (added by Step 1)
  - (next object_11 object_8) — true (initially true)
  => All preconditions satisfied.
- Effects:
  - Add: (vase object_11 object_4)
  - Remove: (next object_11 object_8)
- State change summary after Step 2:
  - (next object_11 object_8) removed.
  - (vase object_11 object_4) added.
  - (next object_4 object_8) remains (until possibly removed later).

Step 3 — t = 2.0 .. 3.0
- Action: wretched object_4 object_8 object_9 object_2
- Parameters: ?o0=object_4, ?o1=object_8, ?o2=object_9, ?o3=object_2
- Preconditions (checked against state after Step 2):
  - (sneeze object_4) — true
  - (texture object_8) — true
  - (texture object_9) — true
  - (stupendous object_2) — true
  - (next object_4 object_8) — true (from Step 1, still present)
  - (collect object_8 object_2) — true (initial)
  - (collect object_9 object_2) — true (initial)
  => All preconditions satisfied.
- Effects:
  - Add: (next object_4 object_9)
  - Remove: (next object_4 object_8)
- State change summary after Step 3:
  - (next object_4 object_8) removed.
  - (next object_4 object_9) added.
  - (vase object_11 object_4) still present from Step 2.

Step 4 — t = 3.0 .. 4.0
- Action: tightfisted object_11 object_4 object_9
- Parameters: ?o0=object_11, ?o1=object_4, ?o2=object_9
- Preconditions (checked against state after Step 3):
  - (hand object_11) — true
  - (sneeze object_4) — true
  - (texture object_9) — true
  - (next object_4 object_9) — true (added by Step 3)
  - (vase object_11 object_4) — true (added by Step 2)
  => All preconditions satisfied.
- Effects:
  - Add: (next object_11 object_9)
  - Remove: (vase object_11 object_4)
- State change summary after Step 4:
  - (next object_11 object_9) added — this is the goal fact.
  - (vase object_11 object_4) removed.

Outcome / verification
- After executing the four listed actions in order, the goal (next object_11 object_9) is true. All preconditions for every action held at the time the action was applied; no missing facts or inconsistencies were encountered.
- Plan cost: 4 actions (unit cost each) — matches the provided cost = 4.

Final relevant facts (selected snapshot)
- next: (object_0 object_5), (object_3 object_5), (object_11 object_9), (object_4 object_9) (plus any other nexts that were not modified)
- vase: (none involving object_11 and object_4) — the vase added in Step 2 was removed in Step 4

Notes
- Each step strictly matches the provided plan; no extra actions were added or removed.
- Timing shown is illustrative (1.0 unit per action) to satisfy the request to report durations/timestamps where possible.
