Summary: The given plan of four actions is valid in scenario A. Executing the actions in order produces the goal fact (next object_12 object_11). Below is a step-by-step, human-readable simulation. I include a simple timestamping (each action takes 1 time unit, starting at t=0) and show the preconditions checked, effects applied, and the relevant facts after each step.

Step 1 — t = 0 → 1
Action: wretched object_5 object_9 object_10 object_3
- Parameters mapping: s=object_5, a=object_9, b=object_10, c=object_3
- Preconditions required:
  - (sneeze object_5) — PRESENT (initial)
  - (texture object_9) — PRESENT (initial)
  - (texture object_10) — PRESENT (initial)
  - (stupendous object_3) — PRESENT (initial)
  - (next object_5 object_9) — PRESENT (initial)
  - (collect object_9 object_3) — PRESENT (initial)
  - (collect object_10 object_3) — PRESENT (initial)
  → All preconditions satisfied.
- Effects applied:
  - ADD: (next object_5 object_10)
  - DELETE: (next object_5 object_9)
- Relevant facts after step 1 (changes only):
  - next object_5 object_10 — now TRUE
  - next object_5 object_9 — now FALSE (removed)

Step 2 — t = 1 → 2
Action: clip object_12 object_5 object_10
- Parameters mapping: h=object_12, s=object_5, b=object_10
- Preconditions required:
  - (hand object_12) — PRESENT (initial)
  - (sneeze object_5) — PRESENT
  - (texture object_10) — PRESENT
  - (next object_5 object_10) — PRESENT (added by Step 1)
  - (next object_12 object_10) — PRESENT (initial)
  → All preconditions satisfied.
- Effects applied:
  - ADD: (vase object_12 object_5)
  - DELETE: (next object_12 object_10)
- Relevant facts after step 2 (changes only):
  - vase object_12 object_5 — now TRUE
  - next object_12 object_10 — now FALSE (removed)

Step 3 — t = 2 → 3
Action: wretched object_5 object_10 object_11 object_3
- Parameters mapping: s=object_5, a=object_10, b=object_11, c=object_3
- Preconditions required:
  - (sneeze object_5) — PRESENT
  - (texture object_10) — PRESENT
  - (texture object_11) — PRESENT (initial)
  - (stupendous object_3) — PRESENT
  - (next object_5 object_10) — PRESENT (from Step 1; not deleted until now)
  - (collect object_10 object_3) — PRESENT (initial)
  - (collect object_11 object_3) — PRESENT (initial)
  → All preconditions satisfied.
- Effects applied:
  - ADD: (next object_5 object_11)
  - DELETE: (next object_5 object_10)
- Relevant facts after step 3 (changes only):
  - next object_5 object_11 — now TRUE
  - next object_5 object_10 — now FALSE (removed)

Step 4 — t = 3 → 4
Action: tightfisted object_12 object_5 object_11
- Parameters mapping: h=object_12, s=object_5, b=object_11
- Preconditions required:
  - (hand object_12) — PRESENT (initial)
  - (sneeze object_5) — PRESENT
  - (texture object_11) — PRESENT
  - (next object_5 object_11) — PRESENT (added by Step 3)
  - (vase object_12 object_5) — PRESENT (added by Step 2)
  → All preconditions satisfied.
- Effects applied:
  - ADD: (next object_12 object_11)
  - DELETE: (vase object_12 object_5)
- Relevant facts after step 4 (changes only):
  - next object_12 object_11 — now TRUE (goal achieved)
  - vase object_12 object_5 — now FALSE (removed)

Final check
- Goal: (next object_12 object_11)
- Result: Achieved after Step 4; (next object_12 object_11) is TRUE.
- Cost: 4 actions (unit cost per action) — matches provided cost = 4.

Conclusion: The provided 4-step plan is valid in scenario A. Each action’s preconditions are met at the time it is executed, effects are applied as described by the domain model, and the final goal (next object_12 object_11) is reached.
