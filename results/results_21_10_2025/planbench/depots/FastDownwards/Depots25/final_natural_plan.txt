Final check (after t=17.0)
- Goal predicates required:
  - (next object_11 object_8) — created at Step 3 and never deleted -> present.
  - (next object_12 object_8) — created at Step 17 -> present.
  - (next object_13 object_10) — created at Step 8 -> present.
- Verdict: The plan as executed produces the required goal facts. All actions in the given plan were applicable when executed (each step’s preconditions were satisfied by the initial facts plus prior effects), and the final state satisfies the scenarioA goal: (next object_11 object_8), (next object_12 object_8), (next object_13 object_10).

If you want, I can (a) produce the same sequence but expressed in more colloquial language (e.g., "Agent holding object_11 forms a vase with object_4 using texture object_10"), or (b) produce a compact timeline without predicate lists. Which would you prefer?
