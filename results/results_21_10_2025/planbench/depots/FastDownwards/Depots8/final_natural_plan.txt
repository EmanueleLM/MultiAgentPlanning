Summary of relevant initial facts (local view used to verify the plan)
- Hands: object_9, object_10
- Sneezes: object_3, object_4
- Textures: object_5, object_6, object_7, object_8
- Next relations initially true: next(object_0,object_7), next(object_0,object_5), next(object_10,object_5), next(object_3,object_5), next(object_4,object_8), next(object_9,object_8), next(object_9,object_5)
- Collect facts: collect(object_5,object_1), collect(object_6,object_1), collect(object_7,object_2), collect(object_8,object_2)
- Stupendous: object_1, object_2
- Goal to reach: next(object_10,object_6) and next(object_9,object_6)

All preconditions needed by the provided plan steps are present in the initial state or are produced by earlier steps. No external/missing facts are required.

Step-by-step (timestamps and predicted state changes)
- Step 1 — t = 0.0s → 1.0s (duration 1s)
  Action: clip(object_9, object_3, object_5)
  Plain-English: With hand object_9 and sneeze object_3 on texture object_5, perform clip to produce a vase relation and move the "next" pointer away from object_9→object_5.
  Preconditions checked:
    - hand(object_9): present (initial)
    - sneeze(object_3): present (initial)
    - texture(object_5): present (initial)
    - next(object_3,object_5): present (initial)
    - next(object_9,object_5): present (initial)
    => All preconditions satisfied.
  Effects (applied):
    - Add: vase(object_9,object_3)
    - Remove: next(object_9,object_5)
  State delta after Step 1:
    - Added vase(object_9,object_3)
    - Removed next(object_9,object_5)

- Step 2 — t = 1.0s → 2.0s (duration 1s)
  Action: clip(object_10, object_3, object_5)
  Plain-English: With hand object_10 and sneeze object_3 on texture object_5, perform clip to create vase(object_10,object_3) and remove next(object_10,object_5).
  Preconditions checked:
    - hand(object_10): present (initial)
    - sneeze(object_3): present (initial)
    - texture(object_5): present (initial)
    - next(object_3,object_5): present (initial, and not changed by Step 1)
    - next(object_10,object_5): present (initial)
    => All preconditions satisfied.
  Effects (applied):
    - Add: vase(object_10,object_3)
    - Remove: next(object_10,object_5)
  State delta after Step 2:
    - Added vase(object_10,object_3)
    - Removed next(object_10,object_5)

- Step 3 — t = 2.0s → 3.0s (duration 1s)
  Action: wretched(object_3, object_5, object_6, object_1)
  Plain-English: Using sneeze object_3, textures object_5 and object_6, and stupendous object_1, perform wretched to redirect next from object_3→object_5 to object_3→object_6 (requires that object_5 and object_6 are collected by object_1).
  Preconditions checked:
    - sneeze(object_3): present (initial)
    - texture(object_5): present (initial)
    - texture(object_6): present (initial)
    - stupendous(object_1): present (initial)
    - next(object_3,object_5): present (initial and not removed by prior steps)
    - collect(object_5,object_1): present (initial)
    - collect(object_6,object_1): present (initial)
    => All preconditions satisfied.
  Effects (applied):
    - Add: next(object_3,object_6)
    - Remove: next(object_3,object_5)
  State delta after Step 3:
    - Added next(object_3,object_6)
    - Removed next(object_3,object_5)

- Step 4 — t = 3.0s → 4.0s (duration 1s)
  Action: tightfisted(object_9, object_3, object_6)
  Plain-English: With hand object_9 and sneeze object_3 on texture object_6, and given vase(object_9,object_3), perform tightfisted to set next(object_9,object_6) and remove vase(object_9,object_3).
  Preconditions checked:
    - hand(object_9): present (initial)
    - sneeze(object_3): present (initial)
    - texture(object_6): present (initial)
    - next(object_3,object_6): present (added by Step 3)
    - vase(object_9,object_3): present (added by Step 1)
    => All preconditions satisfied.
  Effects (applied):
    - Add: next(object_9,object_6)
    - Remove: vase(object_9,object_3)
  State delta after Step 4:
    - Added next(object_9,object_6)
    - Removed vase(object_9,object_3)

- Step 5 — t = 4.0s → 5.0s (duration 1s)
  Action: tightfisted(object_10, object_3, object_6)
  Plain-English: With hand object_10 and sneeze object_3 on texture object_6, and given vase(object_10,object_3), perform tightfisted to set next(object_10,object_6) and remove vase(object_10,object_3).
  Preconditions checked:
    - hand(object_10): present (initial)
    - sneeze(object_3): present (initial)
    - texture(object_6): present (initial)
    - next(object_3,object_6): present (added by Step 3)
    - vase(object_10,object_3): present (added by Step 2)
    => All preconditions satisfied.
  Effects (applied):
    - Add: next(object_10,object_6)
    - Remove: vase(object_10,object_3)
  State delta after Step 5:
    - Added next(object_10,object_6)
    - Removed vase(object_10,object_3)

Final state check and goal validation
- After Step 5 the two goal facts are true:
  - next(object_9,object_6): added in Step 4
  - next(object_10,object_6): added in Step 5
- Therefore the goal (next object_10 object_6 and next object_9 object_6) is satisfied.
- No preconditions were missing at any step; each action was applicable when executed given the initial facts and earlier actions' effects.

Plan timing summary
- Total plan duration (as laid out with 1s per action): 5.0s (steps at t=0–1,1–2,2–3,3–4,4–5)
- All steps executed sequentially in the order provided produce the required goal.
