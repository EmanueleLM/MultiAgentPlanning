FINAL-PLAN
------------------------------
I don't have the agents' structured action models or the initial state — those inputs are required to produce a correct merged PDDL domain + problem. Please provide the action-model summaries (for paltry_agent, sip_agent, clip_agent, wretched_agent, memory_agent, and tightfisted_agent) and the initial-state facts. Each agent's model should include:

- action name(s) and parameter list(s)
- natural-language description of preconditions and effects (or a list of predicate names used)
- any constraints or hard preferences that must be encoded as hard constraints
- any predicates introduced by that agent (with intended arities and types)

Also provide the initial facts (objects and initial predicates) you want used in the problem (or confirm I should invent them). The goal you specified is: next object_8 object_6 — I will use that as the problem goal.

If helpful, you can paste each agent in this simple structured form:

paltry_agent:
- actions:
  - move(obj ?o ?from ?to): pre: at ?o ?from, clear ?to. eff: not (at ?o ?from), (at ?o ?to)
  - ...
- predicates: at(?o - object ?l - loc), clear(?l - loc), ...

When you provide those, I'll:
- reconcile predicate naming conflicts and document the renamings as comments inside the PDDL
- keep each agent's action names distinct (prefixing with agent name if needed)
- produce a single domain (with :requirements limited to :strips, :typing, :negative-preconditions) and a FastDownwards-compatible problem (objects, initial state, goal)
- enclose the domain in <domain></domain> and the problem in <problem></problem>

If you want, I can also create a plausible example domain+problem now (inventing missing details) so you can review the format; tell me whether to invent the agents' actions and initial facts or provide the real inputs.

NATURAL-PLAN sas_plan_1
------------------------------
1) Time 0.0 → 1.0 — Action: sip(object_8, object_1, object_7)
   - Preconditions checked (all true in the initial state VariantB):
     - hand object_8
     - cats object_1
     - texture object_7
     - next object_8 object_7
     - next object_1 object_7
   - Effects applied:
     - Add: vase object_8 object_1
     - Delete: next object_8 object_7
   - Relevant resulting facts after step:
     - vase object_8 object_1 (new)
     - next object_8 object_7 (removed)
     - next object_1 object_7 (still true)

2) Time 1.0 → 2.0 — Action: memory(object_1, object_7, object_6)
   - Preconditions checked (true after step 1):
     - cats object_1
     - spring object_7
     - spring object_6
     - next object_1 object_7
   - Effects applied:
     - Add: next object_1 object_6
     - Delete: next object_1 object_7
   - Relevant resulting facts after step:
     - next object_1 object_6 (new)
     - next object_1 object_7 (removed)
     - vase object_8 object_1 (remains from step 1)

3) Time 2.0 → 3.0 — Action: paltry(object_8, object_1, object_6)
   - Preconditions checked (true after step 2):
     - hand object_8
     - cats object_1
     - texture object_6
     - vase object_8 object_1
     - next object_1 object_6
   - Effects applied:
     - Add: next object_8 object_6
     - Delete: vase object_8 object_1
   - Relevant resulting facts after step:
     - next object_8 object_6 (new — this satisfies the goal)
     - vase object_8 object_1 (removed)

Summary
- Executed actions in order exactly as in the plan: sip → memory → paltry.
- Total (unit) cost: 3.
- Final goal (next object_8 object_6) is achieved at Time 3.0.
