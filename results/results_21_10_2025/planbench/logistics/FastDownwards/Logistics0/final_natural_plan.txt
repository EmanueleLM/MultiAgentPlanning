1) Time 0.0 → 1.0 — Action: sip(object_8, object_1, object_7)
   - Preconditions checked (all true in the initial state VariantB):
     - hand object_8
     - cats object_1
     - texture object_7
     - next object_8 object_7
     - next object_1 object_7
   - Effects applied:
     - Add: vase object_8 object_1
     - Delete: next object_8 object_7
   - Relevant resulting facts after step:
     - vase object_8 object_1 (new)
     - next object_8 object_7 (removed)
     - next object_1 object_7 (still true)

2) Time 1.0 → 2.0 — Action: memory(object_1, object_7, object_6)
   - Preconditions checked (true after step 1):
     - cats object_1
     - spring object_7
     - spring object_6
     - next object_1 object_7
   - Effects applied:
     - Add: next object_1 object_6
     - Delete: next object_1 object_7
   - Relevant resulting facts after step:
     - next object_1 object_6 (new)
     - next object_1 object_7 (removed)
     - vase object_8 object_1 (remains from step 1)

3) Time 2.0 → 3.0 — Action: paltry(object_8, object_1, object_6)
   - Preconditions checked (true after step 2):
     - hand object_8
     - cats object_1
     - texture object_6
     - vase object_8 object_1
     - next object_1 object_6
   - Effects applied:
     - Add: next object_8 object_6
     - Delete: vase object_8 object_1
   - Relevant resulting facts after step:
     - next object_8 object_6 (new — this satisfies the goal)
     - vase object_8 object_1 (removed)

Summary
- Executed actions in order exactly as in the plan: sip → memory → paltry.
- Total (unit) cost: 3.
- Final goal (next object_8 object_6) is achieved at Time 3.0.
