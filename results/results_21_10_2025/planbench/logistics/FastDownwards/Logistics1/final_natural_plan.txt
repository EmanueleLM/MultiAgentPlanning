Plan summary (total cost = 2 units). Two sequential actions, each 1 time unit long:

Step 1 — Time 0.0 → 1.0
- Action: sip object_8 object_0 object_7
- Meaning (human): Using object_8 (in hand) with object_0 (a “cats” object) and object_7 (a “texture” object), perform the sip action relating object_8 and object_0 through object_7.
- Required preconditions (from the domain) and whether they hold in the initial state:
  - hand object_8 — SATISFIED
  - cats object_0 — SATISFIED
  - texture object_7 — SATISFIED
  - next object_8 object_7 — SATISFIED
  - next object_0 object_7 — SATISFIED
- Effects applied when the action executes:
  - Add: vase object_8 object_0
  - Delete: next object_8 object_7
- Derived state changes after Step 1 (delta):
  - Removed: (next object_8 object_7)
  - Added: (vase object_8 object_0)
- Cumulative notable facts after Step 1 (showing only relevant predicates changed or used):
  - vase object_8 object_0 (now true)
  - next object_8 object_7 (now false)
  - other initial facts remain unchanged

Step 2 — Time 1.0 → 2.0
- Action: paltry object_8 object_0 object_6
- Meaning (human): Using object_8 (in hand) with object_0 (a “cats” object) and object_6 (a “texture” object), perform the paltry action to link object_8 to object_6 via object_0.
- Required preconditions (from the domain) and whether they hold at this point:
  - hand object_8 — SATISFIED (from initial)
  - cats object_0 — SATISFIED (from initial)
  - texture object_6 — SATISFIED (from initial)
  - vase object_8 object_0 — SATISFIED (added by Step 1)
  - next object_0 object_6 — SATISFIED (present in the initial facts)
- Effects applied when the action executes:
  - Add: next object_8 object_6
  - Delete: vase object_8 object_0
- Derived state changes after Step 2 (delta):
  - Removed: (vase object_8 object_0)
  - Added: (next object_8 object_6)
- Cumulative notable facts after Step 2:
  - next object_8 object_6 (now true)
  - vase object_8 object_0 (now false)
  - next object_7 object_6 (was already true in the initial state and remains true)

Final check against goals
- Goal: (and (next object_7 object_6) (next object_8 object_6))
  - next object_7 object_6 — TRUE (present in initial state)
  - next object_8 object_6 — TRUE (established by Step 2)
- Conclusion: Both goal conjuncts are satisfied in the final state. The provided plan (sip then paltry) is applicable as given and achieves the combined goal.
