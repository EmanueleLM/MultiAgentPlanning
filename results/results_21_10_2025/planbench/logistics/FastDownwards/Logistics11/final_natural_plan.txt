Step 0 — Time 0
Agent: planner_B
Action: b-wretched(object_4, object_7, object_8, object_2)
Description: Planner B applies wretched with sneeze=object_4, texture1=object_7, texture2=object_8, stupendous=object_2. This moves the "next" relation from (object_4 → object_7) to (object_4 → object_8) (i.e., add next(object_4,object_8); remove next(object_4,object_7)).

Step 1 — Time 1
Agent: planner_A
Action: a-clip(object_10, object_4, object_8)
Description: Planner A applies clip with hand=object_10, sneeze=object_4, texture=object_8. Preconditions satisfied, so this creates vase(object_10,object_4) and removes next(object_10,object_8).

Step 2 — Time 2
Agent: planner_B
Action: b-wretched(object_4, object_8, object_7, object_2)
Description: Planner B applies wretched again, now with sneeze=object_4, texture1=object_8, texture2=object_7, stupendous=object_2. This moves the "next" relation from (object_4 → object_8) back to (object_4 → object_7) (add next(object_4,object_7); remove next(object_4,object_8)).

Step 3 — Time 3
Agent: planner_B
Action: b-tightfisted(object_10, object_4, object_7)
Description: Planner B applies tightfisted with hand=object_10, sneeze=object_4, texture=object_7. Using the existing vase(object_10,object_4) and next(object_4,object_7), this makes next(object_10,object_7) true and removes vase(object_10,object_4).

Step 4 — Time 4
Agent: planner_B
Action: b-wretched(object_3, object_5, object_6, object_1)
Description: Planner B applies wretched with sneeze=object_3, texture1=object_5, texture2=object_6, stupendous=object_1. This moves next(object_3,object_5) to next(object_3,object_6) (add next(object_3,object_6); remove next(object_3,object_5)).

Step 5 — Time 5
Agent: planner_A
Action: a-clip(object_11, object_3, object_6)
Description: Planner A applies clip with hand=object_11, sneeze=object_3, texture=object_6. Preconditions satisfied (including next(object_3,object_6) and next(object_11,object_6)), so this creates vase(object_11,object_3) and removes next(object_11,object_6).

Step 6 — Time 6
Agent: planner_B
Action: b-wretched(object_3, object_6, object_5, object_1)
Description: Planner B applies wretched with sneeze=object_3, texture1=object_6, texture2=object_5, stupendous=object_1. This moves next(object_3,object_6) back to next(object_3,object_5) (add next(object_3,object_5); remove next(object_3,object_6)).

Step 7 — Time 7
Agent: planner_B
Action: b-tightfisted(object_11, object_3, object_5)
Description: Planner B applies tightfisted with hand=object_11, sneeze=object_3, texture=object_5. Using vase(object_11,object_3) and next(object_3,object_5), this makes next(object_11,object_5) true and removes vase(object_11,object_3).

Step 8 — Time 8
Agent: planner_A
Action: a-sip(object_9, object_0, object_5)
Description: Planner A applies sip with hand=object_9, cats=object_0, texture=object_5. Using next(object_9,object_5) and next(object_0,object_5), this creates vase(object_9,object_0) and removes next(object_9,object_5).

Step 9 — Time 9
Agent: planner_A
Action: a-sip(object_11, object_0, object_5)
Description: Planner A applies sip with hand=object_11, cats=object_0, texture=object_5. Using next(object_11,object_5) and next(object_0,object_5), this creates vase(object_11,object_0) and removes next(object_11,object_5).

Step 10 — Time 10
Agent: planner_B
Action: b-memory(object_0, object_5, object_7)
Description: Planner B applies memory with cats=object_0, spring=object_5, spring=object_7 and next(object_0,object_5). This transfers the "next" relation from (object_0 → object_5) to (object_0 → object_7) (add next(object_0,object_7); remove next(object_0,object_5)).

Step 11 — Time 11
Agent: planner_A
Action: a-paltry(object_9, object_0, object_7)
Description: Planner A applies paltry with hand=object_9, cats=object_0, texture=object_7, vase(object_9,object_0) and next(object_0,object_7). This creates next(object_9,object_7) and removes vase(object_9,object_0).

Step 12 — Time 12
Agent: planner_A
Action: a-paltry(object_11, object_0, object_7)
Description: Planner A applies paltry with hand=object_11, cats=object_0, texture=object_7, vase(object_11,object_0) and next(object_0,object_7). This creates next(object_11,object_7) and removes vase(object_11,object_0).

Final state check — Time 13
Goal achieved: next(object_10,object_7) (created at Step 3), next(object_11,object_7) (created at Step 12), and next(object_9,object_7) (created at Step 11) are all true. The plan sequence above matches the provided plan exactly and leads to the specified goal.
