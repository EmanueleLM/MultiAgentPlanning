Below is a human-readable, timestamped sequence of the 19 actions in the provided plan. Each step lists: time window, action with its object parameters, the (required) preconditions used, the effects applied, and the immediate state change result. The sequence follows the plan exactly (no actions added or removed). Times are shown as start–finish with 1.0 time unit per action for readability.

Final verification (after time 19.0):
- Goal predicates achieved:
  - next(object_10, object_8) — true (added at step 14)
  - next(object_11, object_7) — true (added at step 10)
  - next(object_9, object_6) — true (added at step 19)

This sequence exactly mirrors the provided plan, with every action listed in order and its effect on the relevant predicates described. Time slots are illustrative (1.0 unit per action) to satisfy the timestamp/duration requirement.
