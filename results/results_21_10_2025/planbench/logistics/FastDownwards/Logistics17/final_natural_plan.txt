Notes:
- Each step above mirrors exactly one plan action in the provided PDDL plan (no actions were added or removed).
- Each step lists the canonical PDDL effects for that action (add/delete of next or vase) and the typical preconditions required by the action schema; those preconditions are assumed to be satisfied at the time the action is executed (this is consistent with the given valid plan).
- Time stamps assume each action takes one unit of time; if different durations are required, these timestamps can be adjusted accordingly.
