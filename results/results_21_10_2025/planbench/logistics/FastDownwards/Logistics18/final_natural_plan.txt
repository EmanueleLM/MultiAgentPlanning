Summary: the following 12 timed steps follow the provided plan exactly. For each step I list the action, the concrete parameters, whether its preconditions are satisfied at that point, the effects (facts added and deleted), and a short resulting-state note. I use integer timestamps t=1..12 and assume each action takes 1 time unit.

1) t=1 — clip object_11 object_5 object_9
- Action: clip(h=object_11, s=object_5, t=object_9)
- Preconditions at t=1: satisfied
  - (hand object_11), (sneeze object_5), (texture object_9), (next object_5 object_9), (next object_11 object_9)
- Effects:
  - Added: (vase object_11 object_5)
  - Deleted: (next object_11 object_9)
- Notes: object_11 loses next->object_9 and gains a vase relation with object_5.

2) t=2 — wretched object_5 object_9 object_10 object_2
- Action: wretched(s=object_5, t1=object_9, t2=object_10, st=object_2)
- Preconditions at t=2: satisfied
  - (sneeze object_5), (texture object_9), (texture object_10), (stupendous object_2), (next object_5 object_9), (collect object_9 object_2), (collect object_10 object_2)

- Effects:
  - Added: (vase object_12 object_4)

- Effects:
  - Added: (next object_12 object_7)
  - Deleted: (vase object_12 object_4)

6) t=6 — wretched object_4 object_8 object_6 object_2
- Action: wretched(s=object_4, t1=object_8, t2=object_6, st=object_2)

  - (sneeze object_4), (texture object_8), (texture object_6), (stupendous object_2), (next object_4 object_8), (collect object_8 object_2), (collect object_6 object_2)
- Effects:
  - Added: (next object_4 object_6)
  - Deleted: (next object_4 object_8)
- Notes: object_4's next target changes from object_8 to object_6.

7) t=7 — tightfisted object_10 object_4 object_6
- Action: tightfisted(h=object_10, s=object_4, t=object_6)
- Preconditions at t=7: satisfied
  - (hand object_10), (sneeze object_4), (texture object_6), (next object_4 object_6), (vase object_10 object_4)
- Effects:
  - Added: (next object_10 object_6)
  - Deleted: (vase object_10 object_4)
- Notes: object_10 now has next->object_6 (this achieves the goal next object_10 object_6).

8) t=8 — tightfisted object_11 object_5 object_10
- Action: tightfisted(h=object_11, s=object_5, t=object_10)
- Preconditions at t=8: satisfied
  - (hand object_11), (sneeze object_5), (texture object_10), (next object_5 object_10), (vase object_11 object_5)
- Effects:
  - Added: (next object_11 object_10)
  - Deleted: (vase object_11 object_5)
- Notes: object_11 gains next->object_10 (this achieves the goal next object_11 object_10).

9) t=9 — wretched object_5 object_10 object_8 object_2
- Action: wretched(s=object_5, t1=object_10, t2=object_8, st=object_2)
- Preconditions at t=9: satisfied
  - (sneeze object_5), (texture object_10), (texture object_8), (stupendous object_2), (next object_5 object_10), (collect object_10 object_2), (collect object_8 object_2)
- Effects:
  - Added: (next object_5 object_8)
  - Deleted: (next object_5 object_10)
- Notes: object_5's next target changes from object_10 to object_8.

10) t=10 — clip object_11 object_4 object_6
- Action: clip(h=object_11, s=object_4, t=object_6)
- Preconditions at t=10: satisfied
  - (hand object_11), (sneeze object_4), (texture object_6), (next object_4 object_6), (next object_11 object_6)
- Effects:
  - Added: (vase object_11 object_4)
  - Deleted: (next object_11 object_6)
- Notes: object_11 loses next->object_6 (that next had existed from initialization) and gains vase with object_4.

11) t=11 — wretched object_4 object_7 object_8 object_2
- Action: wretched(s=object_4, t1=object_7, t2=object_8, st=object_2)
- Preconditions at t=11: satisfied
  - (sneeze object_4), (texture object_7), (texture object_8), (stupendous object_2), (next object_4 object_7), (collect object_7 object_2), (collect object_8 object_2)
- Effects:
  - Added: (next object_4 object_8)
  - Deleted: (next object_4 object_7)
- Notes: object_4's next target changes back to object_8.

12) t=12 — tightfisted object_11 object_4 object_8
- Action: tightfisted(h=object_11, s=object_4, t=object_8)
- Preconditions at t=12: satisfied
  - (hand object_11), (sneeze object_4), (texture object_8), (next object_4 object_8), (vase object_11 object_4)
- Effects:
  - Added: (next object_11 object_8)
  - Deleted: (vase object_11 object_4)
- Notes: object_11 gains next->object_8 (this achieves the goal next object_11 object_8). At this point the plan’s goal facts are satisfied.

Final relevant facts achieved (after t=12)
- (next object_10 object_6) — achieved at t=7
- (next object_11 object_8) — achieved at t=12
- (next object_12 object_7) — achieved at t=5
- (next object_13 object_9) — was present in the initial state and remained
- (next object_11 object_10) — achieved at t=8

All 12 plan steps were applicable in sequence (preconditions satisfied when executed) and their listed add/delete effects produce the final goal facts.
