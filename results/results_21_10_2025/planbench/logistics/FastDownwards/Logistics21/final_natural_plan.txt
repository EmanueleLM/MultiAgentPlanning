Summary: execute the given 4-step plan exactly as provided. Each step lists a timestamp (integer steps, duration 1 unit each), the action and its arguments, the required preconditions and whether they are satisfied at that time, the effects (facts added and deleted), and the key resulting facts. The final goal (next object_12 object_11) is reached after step 4.

Initial relevant facts (before Step 1)
- sneeze: object_4, object_5
- hand: object_12
- cats: object_0, object_1
- texture: object_6, object_7, object_8, object_9, object_10, object_11
- stupendous: object_2, object_3
- collect: (object_10 object_3), (object_11 object_3), (object_6 object_2), (object_7 object_2), (object_8 object_2), (object_9 object_3)
- next: (object_0 object_6), (object_1 object_9), (object_12 object_10), (object_4 object_7), (object_5 object_9)
- (No vase facts initially)

Plan cost: 4 (unit cost). Assume each step takes 1 time unit. Timestamps are cumulative integer steps.

Step 1 — t = 0 → 1 (duration 1)
Action: wretched object_5 object_9 object_10 object_3
- Parameters meaning: sneeze=object_5, texture_y=object_9, texture_z=object_10, stupendous=object_3, operating on next(object_5, object_9).
- Preconditions required:
  - sneeze object_5 — PRESENT
  - texture object_9 — PRESENT
  - texture object_10 — PRESENT
  - stupendous object_3 — PRESENT
  - next object_5 object_9 — PRESENT
  - collect object_9 object_3 — PRESENT
  - collect object_10 object_3 — PRESENT
  => All preconditions satisfied.
- Effects:
  - ADD next object_5 object_10
  - DELETE next object_5 object_9
- Key resulting facts after Step 1:
  - next object_5 object_10 (new)
  - next object_5 object_9 (removed)
  - next object_12 object_10 (unchanged, still present)
  - No vase facts created/removed by this step

Step 2 — t = 1 → 2 (duration 1)
Action: clip object_12 object_5 object_10
- Parameters meaning: hand=object_12, sneeze=object_5, texture=object_10, uses next(object_5, object_10) and next(object_12, object_10).
- Preconditions required:
  - hand object_12 — PRESENT
  - sneeze object_5 — PRESENT
  - texture object_10 — PRESENT
  - next object_5 object_10 — PRESENT (created by Step 1) — PRESENT
  - next object_12 object_10 — PRESENT (initial) — PRESENT
  => All preconditions satisfied.
- Effects:
  - ADD vase object_12 object_5
  - DELETE next object_12 object_10
- Key resulting facts after Step 2:
  - vase object_12 object_5 (new)
  - next object_12 object_10 (removed)
  - next object_5 object_10 (still present from Step 1)

Step 3 — t = 2 → 3 (duration 1)
Action: wretched object_5 object_10 object_11 object_3
- Parameters meaning: sneeze=object_5, texture_y=object_10, texture_z=object_11, stupendous=object_3, operates on next(object_5, object_10).
- Preconditions required:
  - sneeze object_5 — PRESENT
  - texture object_10 — PRESENT
  - texture object_11 — PRESENT
  - stupendous object_3 — PRESENT
  - next object_5 object_10 — PRESENT (from Step 1) — PRESENT
  - collect object_10 object_3 — PRESENT (initial) — PRESENT
  - collect object_11 object_3 — PRESENT (initial) — PRESENT
  => All preconditions satisfied.
- Effects:
  - ADD next object_5 object_11
  - DELETE next object_5 object_10
- Key resulting facts after Step 3:
  - next object_5 object_11 (new)
  - next object_5 object_10 (removed)
  - vase object_12 object_5 (still present from Step 2)
  - next object_12 object_10 remains deleted from Step 2

Step 4 — t = 3 → 4 (duration 1)
Action: tightfisted object_12 object_5 object_11
- Parameters meaning: hand=object_12, sneeze=object_5, texture=object_11, uses next(object_5, object_11) and requires vase(object_12, object_5).
- Preconditions required:
  - hand object_12 — PRESENT
  - sneeze object_5 — PRESENT
  - texture object_11 — PRESENT
  - next object_5 object_11 — PRESENT (created by Step 3) — PRESENT
  - vase object_12 object_5 — PRESENT (created by Step 2) — PRESENT
  => All preconditions satisfied.
- Effects:
  - ADD next object_12 object_11
  - DELETE vase object_12 object_5
- Key resulting facts after Step 4:
  - next object_12 object_11 (new) — this is the stated goal
  - vase object_12 object_5 (removed)

Final state summary (relevant predicates)
- Goal achieved: next object_12 object_11 — PRESENT
- Other relevant next facts now:
  - next object_0 object_6 (unchanged)
  - next object_1 object_9 (unchanged)
  - next object_4 object_7 (unchanged)
  - next object_5 object_11 (present from Step 3)
  - next object_12 object_10 (deleted at Step 2)
- Vase facts: none remain (vase object_12 object_5 was deleted in Step 4)
- All actions’ preconditions were satisfied when executed; no unmet preconditions or contradictions occurred.

Execution timeline (compact)
1. t0–t1: wretched(object_5,object_9,object_10,object_3) — produces next(object_5,object_10)
2. t1–t2: clip(object_12,object_5,object_10) — produces vase(object_12,object_5), deletes next(object_12,object_10)
3. t2–t3: wretched(object_5,object_10,object_11,object_3) — produces next(object_5,object_11)
4. t3–t4: tightfisted(object_12,object_5,object_11) — produces next(object_12,object_11) (goal), deletes vase(object_12,object_5)

Conclusion: The provided 4-step plan is applicable in sequence given the initial facts and the domain action schemas. All preconditions are met at each step, effects are as specified, and the final goal next object_12 object_11 is achieved at the end of Step 4.
