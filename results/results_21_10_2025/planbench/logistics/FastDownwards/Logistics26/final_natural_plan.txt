Final status (after t = 18.0)
- The goal relations required by the problem are all satisfied by the effects produced:
  - next(object_11, object_5) — created at step 18
  - next(object_12, object_9) — created at step 13
  - next(object_13, object_10) — created at step 4
  - next(object_12, object_6) — created at step 7
  - next(object_14, object_11) — created at step 11

Notes / assumptions
- Each action is presented with a unit duration (1.0) to provide timestamps; the original plan is sequential and costs 18, so the cumulative time is 18.0.
- Preconditions and effects are taken directly from the supplied domain action schemas (paltry, sip, clip, wretched, memory, tightfisted). No steps were added or removed; the order and parameter bindings strictly follow the provided plan.
- The narrative explains the effect on the next/ vase relations (the relations that change), which are the relevant relations for reaching the specified goals.
