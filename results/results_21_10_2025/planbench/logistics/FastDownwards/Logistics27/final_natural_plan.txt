Timeline: actions execute in the order given. Each step is shown with a start timestamp t (units arbitrary) and a duration of 1 time unit (t -> t+1). For each step I list the grounded preconditions required by the domain and the grounded effects (adds / deletes). All action names and parameters match the supplied plan exactly.
