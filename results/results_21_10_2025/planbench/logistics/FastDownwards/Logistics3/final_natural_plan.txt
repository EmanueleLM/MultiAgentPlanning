Below is a human-readable, step-by-step execution of the provided PDDL plan. Each step matches the plan exactly, reports a simple timestamp assuming unit duration per action (cost = 1 per step), lists the action’s required preconditions (per the public schemas), indicates whether those preconditions are satisfied at execution time, and states the action effects (added and deleted facts). At the end I confirm that the final goal predicates are satisfied.

Time convention: actions execute sequentially with unit duration. Step k runs from t = k-1 to t = k.

Step 1 — t = 0.0 → 1.0
Action: sip object_8 object_1 object_6
- Parameters: x = object_8, y = object_1, z = object_6
- sip preconditions: (hand x), (cats y), (texture z), (next x z), (next y z)
  - At t=0 these are: hand object_8 (yes), cats object_1 (yes), texture object_6 (yes), next object_8 object_6 (yes), next object_1 object_6 (yes) → ALL satisfied.
- Effects:
  - Adds: (vase object_8 object_1)
  - Deletes: (next object_8 object_6)

Step 2 — t = 1.0 → 2.0
Action: sip object_7 object_1 object_6
- Parameters: x = object_7, y = object_1, z = object_6
- sip preconditions: (hand object_7), (cats object_1), (texture object_6), (next object_7 object_6), (next object_1 object_6)
  - At t=1 these are: hand object_7 (yes), cats object_1 (yes), texture object_6 (yes), next object_7 object_6 (yes), next object_1 object_6 (yes) → ALL satisfied.
- Effects:
  - Adds: (vase object_7 object_1)
  - Deletes: (next object_7 object_6)

Step 3 — t = 2.0 → 3.0
Action: memory object_1 object_6 object_5
- Parameters: x = object_1, y = object_6, z = object_5
- memory preconditions: (cats x), (spring y), (spring z), (next x y)
  - At t=2: cats object_1 (yes), spring object_6 (yes), spring object_5 (yes), next object_1 object_6 (yes) → ALL satisfied.
- Effects:
  - Adds: (next object_1 object_5)
  - Deletes: (next object_1 object_6)

Step 4 — t = 3.0 → 4.0
Action: paltry object_8 object_1 object_5
- Parameters: x = object_8, y = object_1, z = object_5
- paltry preconditions: (hand x), (cats y), (texture z), (vase x y), (next y z)
  - At t=3: hand object_8 (yes), cats object_1 (yes), texture object_5 (yes), vase object_8 object_1 (yes, added in Step 1), next object_1 object_5 (yes, added in Step 3) → ALL satisfied.
- Effects:
  - Adds: (next object_8 object_5)
  - Deletes: (vase object_8 object_1)

Step 5 — t = 4.0 → 5.0
Action: paltry object_7 object_1 object_5
- Parameters: x = object_7, y = object_1, z = object_5
- paltry preconditions: (hand object_7), (cats object_1), (texture object_5), (vase object_7 object_1), (next object_1 object_5)
  - At t=4: hand object_7 (yes), cats object_1 (yes), texture object_5 (yes), vase object_7 object_1 (yes, added in Step 2), next object_1 object_5 (yes) → ALL satisfied.
- Effects:
  - Adds: (next object_7 object_5)
  - Deletes: (vase object_7 object_1)

Step 6 — t = 5.0 → 6.0
Action: memory object_0 object_6 object_7
- Parameters: x = object_0, y = object_6, z = object_7
- memory preconditions: (cats x), (spring y), (spring z), (next x y)
  - At t=5: cats object_0 (yes), spring object_6 (yes), spring object_7 (yes), next object_0 object_6 (yes initial and not deleted so far) → ALL satisfied.
- Effects:
  - Adds: (next object_0 object_7)
  - Deletes: (next object_0 object_6)

Step 7 — t = 6.0 → 7.0
Action: sip object_9 object_0 object_7
- Parameters: x = object_9, y = object_0, z = object_7
- sip preconditions: (hand x), (cats y), (texture z), (next x z), (next y z)
  - At t=6: hand object_9 (yes), cats object_0 (yes), texture object_7 (yes), next object_9 object_7 (yes initial), next object_0 object_7 (yes, added in Step 6) → ALL satisfied.
- Effects:
  - Adds: (vase object_9 object_0)
  - Deletes: (next object_9 object_7)

Step 8 — t = 7.0 → 8.0
Action: memory object_0 object_7 object_6
- Parameters: x = object_0, y = object_7, z = object_6
- memory preconditions: (cats object_0), (spring object_7), (spring object_6), (next object_0 object_7)
  - At t=7: cats object_0 (yes), spring object_7 (yes), spring object_6 (yes), next object_0 object_7 (yes, added in Step 6) → ALL satisfied.
- Effects:
  - Adds: (next object_0 object_6)
  - Deletes: (next object_0 object_7)

Step 9 — t = 8.0 → 9.0
Action: paltry object_9 object_0 object_6
- Parameters: x = object_9, y = object_0, z = object_6
- paltry preconditions: (hand object_9), (cats object_0), (texture object_6), (vase object_9 object_0), (next object_0 object_6)
  - At t=8: hand object_9 (yes), cats object_0 (yes), texture object_6 (yes), vase object_9 object_0 (yes, added in Step 7), next object_0 object_6 (yes, added in Step 8) → ALL satisfied.
- Effects:
  - Adds: (next object_9 object_6)
  - Deletes: (vase object_9 object_0)

Final verification (after t = 9.0)
Goal predicates required:
- (next object_7 object_5) — added in Step 5 and not deleted later → present.
- (next object_8 object_5) — added in Step 4 and not deleted later → present.
- (next object_8 object_7) — present in the combined initial state and never deleted by any step → present.
- (next object_9 object_6) — added in Step 9 → present.

Conclusion: All actions in the provided plan were applicable at the time they were executed (all preconditions were satisfied when each action ran), and their effects produce the required final goal state. The plan executes in 9 time units (9 steps), consistent with the stated cost = 9.
