Plan (3 steps, each 1 time unit; timestamps shown as start–end):

Step 1 — t=0.0 to t=1.0
- Action: clip object_9 object_4 object_7
- Parameter mapping: object_0=object_9, object_1=object_4, object_2=object_7
- Preconditions checked (all satisfied from the initial facts):
  - (hand object_9)
  - (sneeze object_4)
  - (texture object_7)
  - (next object_4 object_7)
  - (next object_9 object_7)
- Effects:
  - Added: (vase object_9 object_4)
  - Removed: (next object_9 object_7)
- Key facts after this step (changes only):
  - (vase object_9 object_4) is now true
  - (next object_9 object_7) is now false

Step 2 — t=1.0 to t=2.0
- Action: wretched object_4 object_7 object_8 object_2
- Parameter mapping: object_0=object_4, object_1=object_7, object_2=object_8, object_3=object_2
- Preconditions checked (all satisfied given state after Step 1):
  - (sneeze object_4)
  - (texture object_7)
  - (texture object_8)
  - (stupendous object_2)
  - (next object_4 object_7)    — still true (not touched by Step 1)
  - (collect object_7 object_2)
  - (collect object_8 object_2)
- Effects:
  - Added: (next object_4 object_8)
  - Removed: (next object_4 object_7)
- Key facts after this step (changes only):
  - (next object_4 object_8) is now true
  - (next object_4 object_7) is now false

Step 3 — t=2.0 to t=3.0
- Action: tightfisted object_9 object_4 object_8
- Parameter mapping: object_0=object_9, object_1=object_4, object_2=object_8
- Preconditions checked (all satisfied given state after Step 2):
  - (hand object_9)
  - (sneeze object_4)
  - (texture object_8)
  - (next object_4 object_8)   — added by Step 2
  - (vase object_9 object_4)   — added by Step 1
- Effects:
  - Added: (next object_9 object_8)
  - Removed: (vase object_9 object_4)
- Key facts after this step (changes only):
  - (next object_9 object_8) is now true (goal achieved)
  - (vase object_9 object_4) is now false

Final outcome (t=3.0)
- Goal (next object_9 object_8) has been achieved.
- Plan cost/duration: 3 time units (3 actions × 1 unit each).
