Below is a step-by-step, human-readable rendition of the provided plan. Each step matches the plan exactly (no additions or deletions). I show an incremental timestamp (one time unit per action) and a brief, plain-language note of the core effect of each action.

Step 1 — t = 0.0 → 1.0
Action: wretched(object_4, object_7, object_8, object_2)
Effect (summary): Make next(object_4, object_8) true; remove next(object_4, object_7).

Step 2 — t = 1.0 → 2.0
Action: clip(object_9, object_4, object_8)
Effect (summary): Make vase(object_9, object_4) true; remove next(object_9, object_8).

Step 3 — t = 2.0 → 3.0
Action: sip(object_11, object_0, object_5)
Effect (summary): Make vase(object_11, object_0) true; remove next(object_11, object_5).

Step 4 — t = 3.0 → 4.0
Action: sip(object_10, object_0, object_5)
Effect (summary): Make vase(object_10, object_0) true; remove next(object_10, object_5).

Step 5 — t = 4.0 → 5.0
Action: wretched(object_4, object_8, object_7, object_2)
Effect (summary): Make next(object_4, object_7) true; remove next(object_4, object_8).

Step 6 — t = 5.0 → 6.0
Action: tightfisted(object_9, object_4, object_7)
Effect (summary): Make next(object_9, object_7) true; remove vase(object_9, object_4).

Step 7 — t = 6.0 → 7.0
Action: wretched(object_3, object_6, object_5, object_1)
Effect (summary): Make next(object_3, object_5) true; remove next(object_3, object_6).

Step 8 — t = 7.0 → 8.0
Action: memory(object_0, object_5, object_7)
Effect (summary): Make next(object_0, object_7) true; remove next(object_0, object_5).

Step 9 — t = 8.0 → 9.0
Action: sip(object_9, object_0, object_7)
Effect (summary): Make vase(object_9, object_0) true; remove next(object_9, object_7).

Step 10 — t = 9.0 → 10.0
Action: paltry(object_11, object_0, object_7)
Effect (summary): Make next(object_11, object_7) true; remove vase(object_11, object_0).

Step 11 — t = 10.0 → 11.0
Action: paltry(object_10, object_0, object_7)
Effect (summary): Make next(object_10, object_7) true; remove vase(object_10, object_0).

Step 12 — t = 11.0 → 12.0
Action: clip(object_10, object_4, object_7)
Effect (summary): Make vase(object_10, object_4) true; remove next(object_10, object_7).

Step 13 — t = 12.0 → 13.0
Action: wretched(object_4, object_7, object_8, object_2)
Effect (summary): Make next(object_4, object_8) true; remove next(object_4, object_7).

Step 14 — t = 13.0 → 14.0
Action: tightfisted(object_10, object_4, object_8)
Effect (summary): Make next(object_10, object_8) true; remove vase(object_10, object_4).

Step 15 — t = 14.0 → 15.0
Action: memory(object_0, object_7, object_5)
Effect (summary): Make next(object_0, object_5) true; remove next(object_0, object_7).

Step 16 — t = 15.0 → 16.0
Action: paltry(object_9, object_0, object_5)
Effect (summary): Make next(object_9, object_5) true; remove vase(object_9, object_0).

Step 17 — t = 16.0 → 17.0
Action: clip(object_9, object_3, object_5)
Effect (summary): Make vase(object_9, object_3) true; remove next(object_9, object_5).

Step 18 — t = 17.0 → 18.0
Action: wretched(object_3, object_5, object_6, object_1)
Effect (summary): Make next(object_3, object_6) true; remove next(object_3, object_5).

Step 19 — t = 18.0 → 19.0
Action: tightfisted(object_9, object_3, object_6)
Effect (summary): Make next(object_9, object_6) true; remove vase(object_9, object_3).

Final state (after t = 19.0)
- Achieved goal relations:
  - next(object_10, object_8)
  - next(object_11, object_7)
  - next(object_9, object_6)

Total actions executed: 19
Total time (assuming 1 time unit per action): 19.0 time units
