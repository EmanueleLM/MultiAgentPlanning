Summary: below is a human-readable, step-by-step trace of the provided plan. Each step lists the action, the concrete parameters, the action preconditions (what must hold to apply it), whether those preconditions are satisfied at the time (and why — from the initial state or produced earlier in the plan), the action effects (what it adds and what it removes), and an estimated timestamp/duration. The steps follow the given plan exactly and in order. Final verification at the end shows that the required goal facts have been achieved.

Timing convention: actions are executed sequentially, each assigned a 1.0 time-unit duration for readability. Start time t = 0.0.

Step 1 — t = 0.0 → 1.0
Action: clip(object_12, object_4, object_6)
- Preconditions (required):
  - (hand object_12)
  - (sneeze object_4)
  - (texture object_6)
  - (next object_4 object_6)
  - (next object_12 object_6)
- Preconditions satisfied? Yes.
  - (hand object_12), (sneeze object_4), (texture object_6), (next object_4 object_6), (next object_12 object_6) are all present in the initial state.
- Effects:
  - Add: (vase object_12 object_4)
  - Delete: (next object_12 object_6)
- Natural-language: Using object_12 (which is a “hand”), with object_4 (a “sneeze”) and texture object_6 while object_4 and object_12 were both linked to object_6, create vase(object_12,object_4) and remove the next link object_12→object_6.

Step 2 — t = 1.0 → 2.0
Action: wretched(object_4, object_8, object_7, object_2)
- Preconditions (required):
  - (sneeze object_4)
  - (texture object_8)
  - (texture object_7)
  - (stupendous object_2)
  - (next object_4 object_8)
  - (collect object_8 object_2)
  - (collect object_7 object_2)
- Preconditions satisfied? Yes.
  - All listed predicates appear in the initial state (collect object_8 object_2 and collect object_7 object_2 are in the combined initial facts; next object_4 object_8 is present).
- Effects:
  - Add: (next object_4 object_7)
  - Delete: (next object_4 object_8)
- Natural-language: Move object_4’s next link from object_8 to object_7 (because object_2 owns the relevant collect relations and object_4 is a sneeze), creating next(object_4,object_7) and removing next(object_4,object_8).

Step 3 — t = 2.0 → 3.0
Action: tightfisted(object_12, object_4, object_7)
- Preconditions (required):
  - (hand object_12)
  - (sneeze object_4)
  - (texture object_7)
  - (next object_4 object_7)
  - (vase object_12 object_4)
- Preconditions satisfied? Yes.
  - (hand object_12), (sneeze object_4), (texture object_7) from initial state.
  - (next object_4 object_7) was added by Step 2.
  - (vase object_12 object_4) was added by Step 1.
- Effects:
  - Add: (next object_12 object_7)
  - Delete: (vase object_12 object_4)
- Natural-language: Use object_12 with object_4 to remove the vase relationship and create next(object_12,object_7). This achieves next object_12→object_7 (one of the goals).

Step 4 — t = 3.0 → 4.0
Action: sip(object_10, object_0, object_8)
- Preconditions (required):
  - (hand object_10)
  - (cats object_0)
  - (texture object_8)
  - (next object_10 object_8)
  - (next object_0 object_8)
- Preconditions satisfied? Yes.
  - All five predicates are present in the initial state.
- Effects:
  - Add: (vase object_10 object_0)
  - Delete: (next object_10 object_8)
- Natural-language: Combine object_10 and object_0 w.r.t. object_8 to create vase(object_10,object_0) and remove the next link object_10→object_8.

Step 5 — t = 4.0 → 5.0
Action: paltry(object_10, object_0, object_7)
- Preconditions (required):
  - (hand object_10)
  - (cats object_0)
  - (texture object_7)
  - (vase object_10 object_0)
  - (next object_0 object_7)
- Preconditions satisfied? Yes.
  - (hand object_10), (cats object_0), (texture object_7), and (next object_0 object_7) come from the initial state (or union).
  - (vase object_10 object_0) was added by Step 4.
- Effects:
  - Add: (next object_10 object_7)
  - Delete: (vase object_10 object_0)
- Natural-language: Using the vase just created for object_10/object_0 and the next link object_0→object_7, create next(object_10,object_7) and remove vase(object_10,object_0). This achieves next object_10→object_7 (another goal).

Step 6 — t = 5.0 → 6.0
Action: memory(object_0, object_8, object_5)
- Preconditions (required):
  - (cats object_0)
  - (spring object_8)
  - (spring object_5)
  - (next object_0 object_8)
- Preconditions satisfied? Yes.
  - (cats object_0), (spring object_8), (spring object_5) are in the initial state.
  - (next object_0 object_8) is present in the initial state and has not been deleted by earlier steps.
- Effects:
  - Add: (next object_0 object_5)
  - Delete: (next object_0 object_8)
- Natural-language: Move object_0’s next link from object_8 to object_5 (creates next(object_0,object_5) and removes next(object_0,object_8)). This is used to enable the next sip/paltry sequence for object_11.

Step 7 — t = 6.0 → 7.0
Action: sip(object_11, object_0, object_5)
- Preconditions (required):
  - (hand object_11)
  - (cats object_0)
  - (texture object_5)
  - (next object_11 object_5)
  - (next object_0 object_5)
- Preconditions satisfied? Yes.
  - (hand object_11) and (cats object_0) are in the initial state.
  - (texture object_5) is in the initial state.
  - (next object_11 object_5) was present in the initial state.
  - (next object_0 object_5) was added by Step 6.
- Effects:
  - Add: (vase object_11 object_0)
  - Delete: (next object_11 object_5)
- Natural-language: Create vase(object_11,object_0) by combining object_11 and object_0 relative to object_5, and remove next(object_11,object_5).

Step 8 — t = 7.0 → 8.0
Action: paltry(object_11, object_0, object_7)
- Preconditions (required):
  - (hand object_11)
  - (cats object_0)
  - (texture object_7)
  - (vase object_11 object_0)
  - (next object_0 object_7)
- Preconditions satisfied? Yes.
  - (hand object_11), (cats object_0), (texture object_7), (next object_0 object_7) are in the initial state or unchanged.
  - (vase object_11 object_0) was added by Step 7.
- Effects:
  - Add: (next object_11 object_7)
  - Delete: (vase object_11 object_0)
- Natural-language: Use the vase for object_11/object_0 together with the existing next(object_0,object_7) to create next(object_11,object_7). This completes the final required next link.

Final state verification (after t = 8.0)
- Achieved goal facts:
  - (next object_10 object_7) was added in Step 5.
  - (next object_11 object_7) was added in Step 8.
  - (next object_12 object_7) was added in Step 3.
- All three required next relations are present. Final goal satisfied.
- Total plan cost (as provided): 8 (unit cost).

Notes / assumptions made (explicit):
- Actions were applied in the exact order from the plan, one at a time.
- Each action’s preconditions and effects are interpreted exactly as given in the domain (STRIPS-style add/delete).
- Each step cites whether preconditions came from the original initial facts or were produced earlier in the plan; no external facts beyond the problem’s init and the plan effects were assumed.

If you want, I can also produce a compact timeline (timestamped summary only), or a minimal checklist that shows which initial facts enabled each step.
