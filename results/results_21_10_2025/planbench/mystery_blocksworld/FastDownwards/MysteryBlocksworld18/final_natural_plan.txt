Summary: I present the 12-step human-readable execution of the provided PDDL plan. Each step shows a timestamp (1 time unit per action, sequential), the action (with object-role mapping), the required preconditions (from the domain), confirmation that the preconditions were satisfied at that moment, and the effects (predicates added and removed). At the end I confirm the final goal is achieved and report total cost.

Timing convention: steps run sequentially, each step duration = 1 time unit. Step n runs from time (n-1) to time n.

Step 1 — time 0.0 → 1.0
- Action: clip(hand=object_11, sneeze=object_5, texture=object_9)
- Schema preconditions: (hand object_11), (sneeze object_5), (texture object_9), (next object_5 object_9), (next object_11 object_9)
- Preconditions satisfied? Yes (all true in initial state).
- Effects:
  - Added: (vase object_11 object_5)
  - Deleted: (next object_11 object_9)
- Notes: object_11’s previous next-to-9 relation is removed and a vase relation with object_5 is created.

Step 2 — time 1.0 → 2.0
- Action: wretched(sneeze=object_5, texture_B=object_9, texture_C=object_8, stupendous=object_3)
- Schema preconditions: (sneeze object_5), (texture object_9), (texture object_8), (stupendous object_3), (next object_5 object_9), (collect object_9 object_3), (collect object_8 object_3)
- Preconditions satisfied? Yes (next object_5 object_9 remained true; collect pairs present).
- Effects:
  - Added: (next object_5 object_8)
  - Deleted: (next object_5 object_9)
- Notes: object_5’s next relation switches from object_9 to object_8.

Step 3 — time 2.0 → 3.0
- Action: tightfisted(hand=object_11, sneeze=object_5, texture=object_8)
- Schema preconditions: (hand object_11), (sneeze object_5), (texture object_8), (next object_5 object_8), (vase object_11 object_5)
- Preconditions satisfied? Yes (vase(11,5) created in Step 1; next(5,8) created in Step 2).
- Effects:
  - Added: (next object_11 object_8)
  - Deleted: (vase object_11 object_5)
- Notes: This step achieves next(object_11, object_8) — one of the goal facts. The temporary vase between 11 and 5 is removed.

Step 4 — time 3.0 → 4.0
- Action: clip(hand=object_10, sneeze=object_4, texture=object_7)
- Schema preconditions: (hand object_10), (sneeze object_4), (texture object_7), (next object_4 object_7), (next object_10 object_7)
- Preconditions satisfied? Yes (both next relations present initially).
- Effects:
  - Added: (vase object_10 object_4)
  - Deleted: (next object_10 object_7)
- Notes: object_10 loses its next-to-7 link and gains a vase relation with object_4.

Step 5 — time 4.0 → 5.0
- Action: sip(hand=object_12, cats=object_1, texture=object_8)
- Schema preconditions: (hand object_12), (cats object_1), (texture object_8), (next object_12 object_8), (next object_1 object_8)
- Preconditions satisfied? Yes (both next relations present initially).
- Effects:
  - Added: (vase object_12 object_1)
  - Deleted: (next object_12 object_8)
- Notes: object_12’s next-to-8 is removed and vase(12,1) is created.

Step 6 — time 5.0 → 6.0
- Action: memory(cats=object_1, spring_Y=object_8, spring_Z=object_6)
- Schema preconditions: (cats object_1), (spring object_8), (spring object_6), (next object_1 object_8)
- Preconditions satisfied? Yes (next(1,8) remained until now).
- Effects:
  - Added: (next object_1 object_6)
  - Deleted: (next object_1 object_8)
- Notes: object_1’s next link moves from object_8 to object_6.

Step 7 — time 6.0 → 7.0
- Action: wretched(sneeze=object_4, texture_B=object_7, texture_C=object_6, stupendous=object_2)
- Schema preconditions: (sneeze object_4), (texture object_7), (texture object_6), (stupendous object_2), (next object_4 object_7), (collect object_7 object_2), (collect object_6 object_2)
- Preconditions satisfied? Yes (next(4,7) still true; collect pairs present).
- Effects:
  - Added: (next object_4 object_6)
  - Deleted: (next object_4 object_7)
- Notes: object_4’s next changes from object_7 to object_6.

Step 8 — time 7.0 → 8.0
- Action: tightfisted(hand=object_10, sneeze=object_4, texture=object_6)
- Schema preconditions: (hand object_10), (sneeze object_4), (texture object_6), (next object_4 object_6), (vase object_10 object_4)
- Preconditions satisfied? Yes (next(4,6) from Step 7; vase(10,4) from Step 4).
- Effects:
  - Added: (next object_10 object_6)
  - Deleted: (vase object_10 object_4)
- Notes: This achieves next(object_10, object_6) — another goal fact. The vase between 10 and 4 is removed.

Step 9 — time 8.0 → 9.0
- Action: paltry(hand=object_12, cats=object_1, texture=object_6)
- Schema preconditions: (hand object_12), (cats object_1), (texture object_6), (vase object_12 object_1), (next object_1 object_6)
- Preconditions satisfied? Yes (vase(12,1) created in Step 5; next(1,6) created in Step 6).
- Effects:
  - Added: (next object_12 object_6)
  - Deleted: (vase object_12 object_1)
- Notes: object_12 gets next-to-6 (temporary), vase(12,1) removed.

Step 10 — time 9.0 → 10.0
- Action: clip(hand=object_12, sneeze=object_4, texture=object_6)
- Schema preconditions: (hand object_12), (sneeze object_4), (texture object_6), (next object_4 object_6), (next object_12 object_6)
- Preconditions satisfied? Yes (next(4,6) still present from Step 7; next(12,6) from Step 9).
- Effects:
  - Added: (vase object_12 object_4)
  - Deleted: (next object_12 object_6)
- Notes: vase(12,4) created; the temporary next(12,6) is removed.

Step 11 — time 10.0 → 11.0
- Action: wretched(sneeze=object_4, texture_B=object_6, texture_C=object_7, stupendous=object_2)
- Schema preconditions: (sneeze object_4), (texture object_6), (texture object_7), (stupendous object_2), (next object_4 object_6), (collect object_6 object_2), (collect object_7 object_2)
- Preconditions satisfied? Yes (next(4,6) still true; collect pairs present).
- Effects:
  - Added: (next object_4 object_7)
  - Deleted: (next object_4 object_6)
- Notes: object_4’s next returns from object_6 back to object_7.

Step 12 — time 11.0 → 12.0
- Action: tightfisted(hand=object_12, sneeze=object_4, texture=object_7)
- Schema preconditions: (hand object_12), (sneeze object_4), (texture object_7), (next object_4 object_7), (vase object_12 object_4)
- Preconditions satisfied? Yes (next(4,7) created in Step 11; vase(12,4) created in Step 10).
- Effects:
  - Added: (next object_12 object_7)
  - Deleted: (vase object_12 object_4)
- Notes: This achieves next(object_12, object_7) — the last required goal fact.

Final state (relevant goal predicates):
- (next object_10 object_6) — added in Step 8
- (next object_11 object_8) — added in Step 3
- (next object_12 object_7) — added in Step 12
- (next object_13 object_9) — remained true from initial state

Goal check: All required goal predicates are present. Goal is achieved at time 12.0.

Other remarks and assumptions:
- I used 1 time unit per action (sequential execution). This matches the sequential plan ordering and the given plan’s cost = 12 (unit cost per action).
- No extra actions were added or removed; I followed the given plan exactly.
- Preconditions were verified against the evolving state after each step; all steps are applicable in the presented order and the effects lead to the goal.
- No unstated predicates or actions were invented.

Total steps: 12
Total time: 12.0 time units
Total cost (unit cost per action): 12
