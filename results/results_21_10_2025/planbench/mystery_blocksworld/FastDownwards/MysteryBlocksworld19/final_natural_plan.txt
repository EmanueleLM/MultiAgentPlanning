Plan (human-readable, step-by-step). Each line shows: step number, timestamp (t = step index), the action with its object arguments, the required preconditions (noting they are satisfied), the effects applied, and the updated key relations (next, vase). Start state (t = -): next = {(0,8), (11,6), (3,7), (4,8)}; vase = {}. Other unary predicates (hand, cats, sneeze, spring, stupendous, texture, collect) are as given in the problem and are used below.

Step 1 — t=0
Action: wretched object_3 object_7 object_6 object_1

- Preconditions satisfied: yes
- Effects: add next(object_0,object_5); delete next(object_0,object_8)
- Updated relations:
  - next = {(0,5), (3,5), (4,8), (11,5)}
  - vase = {}

Step 6 — t=5
Action: sip object_11 object_0 object_5
- Preconditions required: hand(object_11), cats(object_0), texture(object_5), next(object_11,object_5), next(object_0,object_5)
- Preconditions satisfied: yes
- Effects: add vase(object_11,object_0); delete next(object_11,object_5)
- Updated relations:
  - next = {(0,5), (3,5), (4,8)}
  - vase = {(11,0)}

Step 7 — t=6
Action: memory object_0 object_5 object_8
- Preconditions required: cats(object_0), spring(object_5), spring(object_8), next(object_0,object_5)
- Preconditions satisfied: yes
- Effects: add next(object_0,object_8); delete next(object_0,object_5)
- Updated relations:
  - next = {(0,8), (3,5), (4,8)}
  - vase = {(11,0)}

Step 8 — t=7
Action: paltry object_11 object_0 object_8
- Preconditions required: hand(object_11), cats(object_0), texture(object_8), vase(object_11,object_0), next(object_0,object_8)
- Preconditions satisfied: yes
- Effects: add next(object_11,object_8); delete vase(object_11,object_0)
- Updated relations:
  - next = {(0,8), (3,5), (4,8), (11,8)}
  - vase = {}

Step 9 — t=8
Action: clip object_11 object_4 object_8
- Preconditions required: hand(object_11), sneeze(object_4), texture(object_8), next(object_4,object_8), next(object_11,object_8)
- Preconditions satisfied: yes
- Effects: add vase(object_11,object_4); delete next(object_11,object_8)
- Updated relations:
  - next = {(0,8), (3,5), (4,8)}
  - vase = {(11,4)}

Step 10 — t=9
Action: wretched object_4 object_8 object_10 object_2
- Preconditions required: sneeze(object_4), texture(object_8), texture(object_10), stupendous(object_2), next(object_4,object_8), collect(object_8,object_2), collect(object_10,object_2)
- Preconditions satisfied: yes
- Effects: add next(object_4,object_10); delete next(object_4,object_8)
- Updated relations:
  - next = {(0,8), (3,5), (4,10)}
  - vase = {(11,4)}

Step 11 — t=10
Action: tightfisted object_11 object_4 object_10
- Preconditions required: hand(object_11), sneeze(object_4), texture(object_10), next(object_4,object_10), vase(object_11,object_4)
- Preconditions satisfied: yes

- Updated relations:
  - next = {(0,8), (3,5), (4,10), (11,10)}
  - vase = {}

Goal check (after t=10)
- Goal: next(object_11,object_10)
- Status: achieved (next(object_11,object_10) is present)

Total steps: 11 (cost = 11 unit steps). All preconditions at each step are satisfied given the initial facts and the sequence of effects. The final state contains next(object_11,object_10), so the plan achieves the stated goal.
