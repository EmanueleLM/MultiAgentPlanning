Summary: The plan is executed by agent "observer" in four ordered steps. I list each step with a timestamp (1 unit per step), the required preconditions (and whether they held when the step was applied), the add/delete effects, and the resulting local state changes. All four steps are applicable in sequence and the final goal (next object_12 object_11) is achieved.

Initial relevant facts (from Scenario A): 
- hand(object_12), sneeze(object_4), sneeze(object_5), texture(object_10), texture(object_11), texture(object_6), texture(object_7), texture(object_8), texture(object_9),
- next(object_0,object_6), next(object_1,object_9), next(object_12,object_10), next(object_4,object_7), next(object_5,object_9),
- collect(object_10,object_3), collect(object_11,object_3), collect(object_6,object_2), collect(object_7,object_2), collect(object_8,object_2), collect(object_9,object_3),
- stupendous(object_2), stupendous(object_3), cats(object_0), cats(object_1), spring(object_6), spring(object_9).

Step 1 — t = 0 → 1 (duration: 1)
Action: wretched(observer, o0=object_5, o1=object_9, o2=object_10, o3=object_3)

Preconditions (wretched requires):
- (sneeze object_5) — satisfied (present).
- (texture object_9) — satisfied.
- (texture object_10) — satisfied.
- (stupendous object_3) — satisfied.
- (next object_5 object_9) — satisfied.
- (collect object_9 object_3) — satisfied.
- (collect object_10 object_3) — satisfied.

Applicability: All preconditions satisfied → action applicable.

Effects:
- Add: (next object_5 object_10)
- Delete: (next object_5 object_9)

State change after Step 1:
- next(object_5,object_10) is now true.
- next(object_5,object_9) is removed.

Step 2 — t = 1 → 2 (duration: 1)
Action: clip(observer, o0=object_12, o1=object_5, o2=object_10)

Preconditions (clip requires):
- (hand object_12) — satisfied.
- (sneeze object_5) — satisfied.
- (texture object_10) — satisfied.
- (next object_5 object_10) — satisfied (created by Step 1).
- (next object_12 object_10) — satisfied (initial fact).

Applicability: All preconditions satisfied → action applicable.

Effects:
- Add: (vase object_12 object_5)
- Delete: (next object_12 object_10)

State change after Step 2:
- vase(object_12,object_5) is now true.
- next(object_12,object_10) is removed.

Step 3 — t = 2 → 3 (duration: 1)
Action: wretched(observer, o0=object_5, o1=object_10, o2=object_11, o3=object_3)

Preconditions (wretched requires):
- (sneeze object_5) — satisfied.
- (texture object_10) — satisfied.
- (texture object_11) — satisfied.
- (stupendous object_3) — satisfied.
- (next object_5 object_10) — satisfied (created by Step 1 and still present until now).
- (collect object_10 object_3) — satisfied (initial fact).
- (collect object_11 object_3) — satisfied (initial fact).

Applicability: All preconditions satisfied → action applicable.

Effects:
- Add: (next object_5 object_11)
- Delete: (next object_5 object_10)

State change after Step 3:
- next(object_5,object_11) is now true.
- next(object_5,object_10) is removed.

Step 4 — t = 3 → 4 (duration: 1)
Action: tightfisted(observer, o0=object_12, o1=object_5, o2=object_11)

Preconditions (tightfisted requires):
- (hand object_12) — satisfied.
- (sneeze object_5) — satisfied.
- (texture object_11) — satisfied.
- (next object_5 object_11) — satisfied (created by Step 3).
- (vase object_12 object_5) — satisfied (created by Step 2).

Applicability: All preconditions satisfied → action applicable.

Effects:
- Add: (next object_12 object_11)
- Delete: (vase object_12 object_5)

State change after Step 4:
- next(object_12,object_11) is now true (goal achieved).
- vase(object_12,object_5) is removed.

Final check:
- Goal (next object_12 object_11) is true after Step 4. The plan of four steps executed by observer is valid and achieves the goal.
