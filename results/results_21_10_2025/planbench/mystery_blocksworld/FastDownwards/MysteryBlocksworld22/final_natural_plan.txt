Below is a clear, step-by-step human-readable execution of the provided plan. I list each action in order, assign a timestamp (one time unit per action), state the minimal preconditions that must hold when the action is applied, and state the direct effects (what is added and what is removed). Timestamps are integers starting at t=0; each action has duration = 1 time unit.

Plan complete at t=18.

Final relevant facts (after last action):
- next(object_11,object_7) — added at Step 18 (goal met).
- next(object_12,object_5) — added at Step 14 (goal met).
(Other next and vase relations were created and removed along the way as described in each step.)

This listing matches the plan exactly (18 actions), shows when each action occurs, and reports the preconditions and effects for each step.
