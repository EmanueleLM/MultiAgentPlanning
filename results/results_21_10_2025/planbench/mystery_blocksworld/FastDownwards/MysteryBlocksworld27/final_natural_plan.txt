Summary: sequential, human-readable execution of the given plan. I assign each step a timestamp as an ordinal time (t=1..24). For each step I list: the action instance, the concrete object arguments, the preconditions (predicates required) and where they came from (initial or produced earlier), and the effect (predicates added and predicates removed). Object names are used exactly as in the problem.

  - next(object_13, object_10) — added at t=19
  - next(object_14, object_11) — added at t=21

Notes on timestamps/duration
- I used simple ordinal timestamps t=1..24 (one timestamp per action in plan order). No durations were provided in the input, so each action is assigned the next integer timestamp to record ordering and provenance.
- Every precondition cited is either present in the initial state (marked “initial”) or created by an earlier step (marked with that step’s timestamp).

This listing strictly follows every action instance in the provided plan, records the concrete parameter objects, shows the preconditions used for each step together with their provenance, and shows the exact add/delete effects per the domain semantics. The final goal predicates are satisfied at the indicated steps.
