Below is a step-by-step, human-readable trace of the provided plan. Each step is listed in plan order, given a timestamp (starting at t=0) and a short duration (1 time unit assigned for readability). For each action I show: the grounded action call, a plain-English description of what it does, the main preconditions used, and the concrete predicate changes (what next/ vase relations are removed/added).

Final note (goal verification)
- The sequence above yields the required goal next relations:
  - next object_12 object_10 (created at Step 15)
  - next object_13 object_10 (created at Step 14)
  - next object_14 object_9 (was present in the initial state and remained)
  - next object_11 object_9 (created at Step 18)
  - next object_12 object_8 (created at Step 11)
  - next object_13 object_5 (created at Step 21)
  - next object_14 object_7 (created at Step 9)

This step-by-step trace follows the provided plan exactly (21 actions) and reports the key preconditions and the concrete predicate changes at each step.
