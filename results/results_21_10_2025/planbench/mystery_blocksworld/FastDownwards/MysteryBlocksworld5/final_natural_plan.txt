Step 1 — time 0.0 to 1.0 (duration 1.0)
Action: clip object_9 object_4 object_7

Preconditions checked (all true in the initial state):
- hand object_9
- sneeze object_4
- texture object_7
- next object_4 object_7
- next object_9 object_7

Effects applied:
- Added: vase object_9 object_4
- Removed: next object_9 object_7

State after Step 1 (relevant facts):
- vase(object_9,object_4) is true
- next(object_9,object_7) is false (removed)
- next(object_4,object_7) remains true

Step 2 — time 1.0 to 2.0 (duration 1.0)
Action: wretched object_4 object_7 object_8 object_2

Preconditions checked (all true at time 1.0):
- sneeze object_4
- texture object_7
- texture object_8
- stupendous object_2
- next object_4 object_7
- collect object_7 object_2
- collect object_8 object_2

Effects applied:
- Added: next object_4 object_8
- Removed: next object_4 object_7

State after Step 2 (relevant facts):
- next(object_4,object_8) is true
- next(object_4,object_7) is false (removed)
- vase(object_9,object_4) remains true (from Step 1)

Step 3 — time 2.0 to 3.0 (duration 1.0)
Action: tightfisted object_9 object_4 object_8

Preconditions checked (all true at time 2.0):
- hand object_9
- sneeze object_4
- texture object_8
- next object_4 object_8
- vase object_9 object_4

Effects applied:
- Added: next object_9 object_8
- Removed: vase object_9 object_4

Final state (relevant facts):
- next(object_9,object_8) is true — the problem goal is achieved.
- vase(object_9,object_4) is now false (removed)

Plan summary:
- Actions executed in order: 
  1) clip object_9 object_4 object_7 (t=0.0→1.0)
  2) wretched object_4 object_7 object_8 object_2 (t=1.0→2.0)
  3) tightfisted object_9 object_4 object_8 (t=2.0→3.0)
- Unit cost: 3
- Goal (next object_9 object_8) satisfied at time 3.0.
