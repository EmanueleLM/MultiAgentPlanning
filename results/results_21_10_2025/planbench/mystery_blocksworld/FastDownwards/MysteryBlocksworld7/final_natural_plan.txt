Plan summary (timestamps assigned for clarity; each action assumed to take 1 time unit):

Step 1 — t=0 → t=1
Action: (scenarioa-sip object_9 object_0 object_8)
- Natural-language: Agent scenarioA performs "sip" with hand object_9, using cats object_0 and texture object_8.
- Preconditions checked:
  - hand object_9 — present in initial state.
  - cats object_0 — present in initial state.
  - texture object_8 — present in initial state.
  - next object_9 object_8 — present in initial state.
  - next object_0 object_8 — present in initial state.
  => All preconditions satisfied.
- Effects:
  - Add: vase object_9 object_0
  - Remove: next object_9 object_8
- Notes: after this step vase(object_9,object_0) is true and next(object_9,object_8) is no longer true.

Step 2 — t=1 → t=2
Action: (scenarioa-paltry object_9 object_0 object_7)
- Natural-language: Agent scenarioA performs "paltry" with hand object_9, cats object_0, and texture object_7.
- Preconditions checked:
  - hand object_9 — true (initial).
  - cats object_0 — true (initial).
  - texture object_7 — true (initial).
  - vase object_9 object_0 — became true in Step 1.
  - next object_0 object_7 — present in initial state.
  => All preconditions satisfied.
- Effects:
  - Add: next object_9 object_7
  - Remove: vase object_9 object_0
- Notes: next(object_9,object_7) is now true (this satisfies the goal next object_9 object_7). vase(object_9,object_0) is removed.

Step 3 — t=2 → t=3
Action: (scenarioa-wretched object_4 object_8 object_9 object_3)
- Natural-language: Agent scenarioA performs "wretched" with sneeze object_4, textures object_8 and object_9, stupendous object_3.
- Preconditions checked:
  - sneeze object_4 — present in initial state.
  - texture object_8 — present in initial state.
  - texture object_9 — present in initial state.
  - stupendous object_3 — present in initial state.
  - next object_4 object_8 — present in initial state.
  - collect object_8 object_3 — present in initial state.
  - collect object_9 object_3 — present in initial state.
  => All preconditions satisfied.
- Effects:
  - Add: next object_4 object_9
  - Remove: next object_4 object_8
- Notes: next(object_4,object_9) now true; next(object_4,object_8) removed.

Step 4 — t=3 → t=4
Action: (scenarioa-clip object_10 object_4 object_9)
- Natural-language: Agent scenarioA performs "clip" with hand object_10, sneeze object_4, texture object_9.
- Preconditions checked:
  - hand object_10 — present in initial state.
  - sneeze object_4 — present in initial state.
  - texture object_9 — present in initial state.
  - next object_4 object_9 — added in Step 3.
  - next object_10 object_9 — present in initial state.
  => All preconditions satisfied.
- Effects:
  - Add: vase object_10 object_4
  - Remove: next object_10 object_9
- Notes: vase(object_10,object_4) becomes true; next(object_10,object_9) is removed.

Step 5 — t=4 → t=5
Action: (scenarioa-tightfisted object_10 object_4 object_6)
- Natural-language: Agent scenarioA performs "tightfisted" with hand object_10, sneeze object_4, texture object_6, using vase object_10 object_4.
- Preconditions checked:
  - hand object_10 — present in initial state.
  - sneeze object_4 — present in initial state.
  - texture object_6 — present in initial state.
  - next object_4 object_6 — present in initial state (was never removed).
  - vase object_10 object_4 — added in Step 4.
  => All preconditions satisfied.
- Effects:
  - Add: next object_10 object_6
  - Remove: vase object_10 object_4
- Notes: next(object_10,object_6) becomes true (this satisfies the goal next object_10 object_6). vase(object_10,object_4) is removed.

Final state relative to goals (after t=5):
- Goal next object_10 object_6 — achieved in Step 5.
- Goal next object_10 object_5 — was present in the initial state and remained unchanged.
- Goal next object_9 object_7 — achieved in Step 2.

All plan steps matched exactly, preconditions were provable from the initial facts plus earlier action effects, and the final goals are satisfied. Total actions: 5; total duration (as timestamped) = 5 time units.
