PROBLEM
------------------------------
I am playing with a set of objects. Here are the actions I can do

Paltry object_0 object_1 object_2.

Clip object_0 object_1 object_2.
Wretched object_0 object_1 object_2 object_3.
Memory object_0 object_1 object_2.
Tightfisted object_0 object_1 object_2.

I have the following restrictions on my actions:
To perform paltry action, the following facts need to be true: hand object_0, cats object_1, texture object_2, vase object_0 object_1, and next object_1 object_2
Once paltry is performed the following facts will be true: next object_0 object_2
Once paltry is performed the following facts will be false: vase object_0 object_1
To perform sip action, the following facts need to be true: hand object_0, cats object_1, texture object_2, next object_0 object_2, and next object_1 object_2
Once sip is performed the following facts will be true: vase object_0 object_1
Once sip is performed the following facts will be false: next object_0 object_2

NATURAL-PLAN sas_plan_1
------------------------------
Plan (3 steps, unit duration each; total cost = 3)

Initial state highlights (before step 0):
- hand: object_8
- cats: object_0, object_1
- texture: object_6, object_7
- spring: object_6, object_7
- next: (object_0 object_7), (object_1 object_7), (object_4 object_6), (object_5 object_7), (object_8 object_7)
- collect: (object_6 object_2), (object_7 object_3)
- sneeze: object_4, object_5
- stupendous: object_2, object_3
- No vase facts initially.

Step 1 — time 0 to 1
Action: sip object_8 object_1 object_7
- Parameters: o0=object_8, o1=object_1, o2=object_7
- Preconditions checked and satisfied:
  - (hand object_8) — true
  - (cats object_1) — true
  - (texture object_7) — true
  - (next object_8 object_7) — true
  - (next object_1 object_7) — true
- Effects applied:
  - Add (vase object_8 object_1)
  - Delete (next object_8 object_7)
- State change summary after step 1:
  - (vase object_8 object_1) becomes true
  - (next object_8 object_7) is removed

Step 2 — time 1 to 2
Action: memory object_1 object_7 object_6
- Parameters: o0=object_1, o1=object_7, o2=object_6
- Preconditions checked and satisfied:
  - (cats object_1) — true
  - (spring object_7) — true
  - (spring object_6) — true
  - (next object_1 object_7) — true (still true after Step 1)
- Effects applied:
  - Add (next object_1 object_6)
  - Delete (next object_1 object_7)
- State change summary after step 2:
  - (next object_1 object_6) becomes true
  - (next object_1 object_7) is removed

Step 3 — time 2 to 3
Action: paltry object_8 object_1 object_6
- Parameters: o0=object_8, o1=object_1, o2=object_6
- Preconditions checked and satisfied:
  - (hand object_8) — true
  - (cats object_1) — true
  - (texture object_6) — true
  - (vase object_8 object_1) — true (added in Step 1)
  - (next object_1 object_6) — true (added in Step 2)
- Effects applied:
  - Add (next object_8 object_6)
  - Delete (vase object_8 object_1)
- State change summary after step 3:
  - (next object_8 object_6) becomes true (goal achieved)
  - (vase object_8 object_1) is removed

Goal check (after time 3)
- Goal (next object_8 object_6) is true. Goal achieved at time 3.

Total plan cost: 3 (three unit-duration actions).

NATURAL-PLAN sas_plan_1
------------------------------
Summary: execute the two planned actions in order. Each step shows a timestamp (start → end), required preconditions and whether they are present, the effects applied, and the resulting key facts. Total plan cost: 2 (unit cost).

Step 1 — Action: sip object_8 object_0 object_7
- Time: 00:00:00 → 00:00:01 (duration 1)
- Action signature: sip ?o0 ?o1 ?o2  => sip object_8 object_0 object_7
- Preconditions (required):
  - hand object_8 — PRESENT (initial facts)
  - cats object_0 — PRESENT (initial facts)
  - texture object_7 — PRESENT (initial facts)
  - next object_8 object_7 — PRESENT (initial facts)
  - next object_0 object_7 — PRESENT (initial facts)
  => All preconditions satisfied.
- Effects applied:
  - Add: vase object_8 object_0
  - Remove: next object_8 object_7
- State changes (key facts after step):
  - next object_8 object_7 is removed.
  - vase object_8 object_0 is now true.
  - Other facts remain unchanged unless listed above.

Step 2 — Action: paltry object_8 object_0 object_6
- Time: 00:00:01 → 00:00:02 (duration 1)
- Action signature: paltry ?o0 ?o1 ?o2  => paltry object_8 object_0 object_6
- Preconditions (required):
  - hand object_8 — PRESENT (initial facts)
  - cats object_0 — PRESENT (initial facts)
  - texture object_6 — PRESENT (initial facts)
  - vase object_8 object_0 — PRESENT (added by Step 1)
  - next object_0 object_6 — PRESENT (initial facts)
  => All preconditions satisfied.
- Effects applied:
  - Add: next object_8 object_6
  - Remove: vase object_8 object_0
- State changes (key facts after step):
  - next object_8 object_6 is now true.
  - vase object_8 object_0 is removed.
  - next object_7 object_6 was already true in the initial state and remains true.

Final state check (after both steps, time 00:00:02):
- Required goal predicates:
  - next object_7 object_6 — PRESENT (from initial state)
  - next object_8 object_6 — PRESENT (added in Step 2)
=> Goal satisfied.

Plan cost: 2 (two actions, unit cost each).

NATURAL-PLAN sas_plan_1
------------------------------
Below is a clear, step-by-step, human-readable trace of the given plan. Each step matches the plan exactly, shows a simple timestamp (relative, starting at t=0) and duration (1 time unit each), lists the action's required preconditions and whether they are satisfied at that moment, and states the add/delete effects produced. At the end I confirm that the final goal is achieved.

Initial relevant facts (before step 1)
- cats object_0
- collect object_5 object_1
- collect object_6 object_2
- hand object_7
- hand object_8
- next object_0 object_6
- next object_3 object_5
- next object_4 object_6
- next object_7 object_6
- next object_8 object_6
- sneeze object_3
- sneeze object_4
- spring object_5
- spring object_6
- stupendous object_1
- stupendous object_2
- texture object_5
- texture object_6
(There are no vase(...) facts initially.)

Step 1 — t=0.0 to t=1.0
Action: sip object_8 object_0 object_6
- Parameters mapping: ?o0 = object_8, ?o1 = object_0, ?o2 = object_6
- Preconditions (required):
  - hand object_8 — satisfied (initial)
  - cats object_0 — satisfied (initial)
  - texture object_6 — satisfied (initial)
  - next object_8 object_6 — satisfied (initial)
  - next object_0 object_6 — satisfied (initial)
- Effects:
  - Add: vase object_8 object_0 (becomes true)
  - Delete: next object_8 object_6 (becomes false)
- Resulting relevant facts after step: vase object_8 object_0 is true; next object_8 object_6 removed. next object_0 object_6 remains true.

Step 2 — t=1.0 to t=2.0
Action: sip object_7 object_0 object_6
- Parameters: ?o0 = object_7, ?o1 = object_0, ?o2 = object_6
- Preconditions:
  - hand object_7 — satisfied (initial)
  - cats object_0 — satisfied (initial)
  - texture object_6 — satisfied (initial)
  - next object_7 object_6 — satisfied (initial)
  - next object_0 object_6 — still satisfied (was not deleted by step 1)
- Effects:
  - Add: vase object_7 object_0 (becomes true)
  - Delete: next object_7 object_6 (becomes false)
- Resulting relevant facts after step: vase object_7 object_0 is true; next object_7 object_6 removed. next object_0 object_6 remains true.

Step 3 — t=2.0 to t=3.0
Action: memory object_0 object_6 object_5
- Parameters: ?o0 = object_0, ?o1 = object_6, ?o2 = object_5
- Preconditions:
  - cats object_0 — satisfied (initial)
  - spring object_6 — satisfied (initial)
  - spring object_5 — satisfied (initial)
  - next object_0 object_6 — satisfied (carried over until now)
- Effects:
  - Add: next object_0 object_5 (becomes true)
  - Delete: next object_0 object_6 (becomes false)
- Resulting relevant facts after step: next object_0 object_5 is true; next object_0 object_6 removed.

Step 4 — t=3.0 to t=4.0
Action: paltry object_8 object_0 object_5
- Parameters: ?o0 = object_8, ?o1 = object_0, ?o2 = object_5
- Preconditions:
  - hand object_8 — satisfied (initial)
  - cats object_0 — satisfied (initial)
  - texture object_5 — satisfied (initial)
  - vase object_8 object_0 — satisfied (added by Step 1)
  - next object_0 object_5 — satisfied (added by Step 3)
- Effects:
  - Add: next object_8 object_5 (becomes true)
  - Delete: vase object_8 object_0 (becomes false)
- Resulting relevant facts after step: next object_8 object_5 is true; vase object_8 object_0 removed. (vase object_7 object_0 still true from Step 2)

Step 5 — t=4.0 to t=5.0
Action: paltry object_7 object_0 object_5
- Parameters: ?o0 = object_7, ?o1 = object_0, ?o2 = object_5
- Preconditions:
  - hand object_7 — satisfied (initial)
  - cats object_0 — satisfied (initial)
  - texture object_5 — satisfied (initial)
  - vase object_7 object_0 — satisfied (added by Step 2)
  - next object_0 object_5 — satisfied (added by Step 3)
- Effects:
  - Add: next object_7 object_5 (becomes true)
  - Delete: vase object_7 object_0 (becomes false)
- Resulting relevant facts after step: next object_7 object_5 is true; vase object_7 object_0 removed.

Final relevant facts (after step 5)
- next object_7 object_5 — true (added Step 5)
- next object_8 object_5 — true (added Step 4)
- The plan did not reintroduce next object_0 object_6, next object_7 object_6, or next object_8 object_6 (those were deleted during the run).

Goal check
- Goal: (next object_7 object_5) AND (next object_8 object_5)
- Both are true in the final state. The plan achieves the goal.

Summary
- The sequence of five actions (sip, sip, memory, paltry, paltry) is valid given the initial facts and the action schemata. Each action's preconditions were met when executed, and the actions produced the specified add/delete effects. The final goal (next object_7 object_5 and next object_8 object_5) is achieved at t=5.0.

FINAL-PLAN
------------------------------
I don't have the public action model or the analysis results from analyst_A and analyst_B in this conversation, so I cannot generate a correct, complete PDDL domain and problem(s) yet. Please provide those inputs. To make that easy, below I list exactly what I need and give a short checklist and formatting guidance so the PDDL I generate will be compatible with Fast Downwards and your constraints.

What I need from you (copy/paste the analysts' outputs and the public action model):
1. Public action model (natural-language description of each available action):
   - Action name, actors/agent who can execute it (distinct agents if multiple), preconditions (facts that must hold), and effects (facts added and facts deleted).
   - If any action has conditional effects or ADL-like semantics, state them explicitly.
   - If any actions are unavailable to some agents or depend on resources, state that.

2. Analyst_A report:
   - List of inferred or observed facts about the initial environment (objects, agents, locations, resource quantities).
   - Any constraints or preferences that must be treated as strict (the prompt instructs to treat "would rather/avoid/earliest" as hard constraints).
   - Any ambiguous elements Analyst_A flagged and any suggested resolutions.

3. Analyst_B report:
   - Same format: initial facts, constraints, ambiguities flagged, and suggested resolutions.

4. Scenario(s) to encode as problem(s):
   - Concrete list of objects (with types if relevant), which agents exist, and the initial truth values (predicates that are true initially).
   - The goal condition(s) to achieve (exact logical formula expected).
   - If there are multiple scenarios, give each scenario separately.

5. Any additional constraints:
   - Are there typed object classes you want used? (e.g., agent, location, package, resource)
   - Are there resources with numeric quantities? Note: Fast Downwards STRIPS doesn't support numeric fluents unless we use specialized extensions; per developer instructions, limit to :strips, :typing, :negative-preconditions (and optionally :action-costs). If resources must be numeric, state whether they can be modeled as discrete counted objects instead.

Formatting guidance (so I can convert directly to PDDL):
- For each action, provide something like:
  Action: move
  Agent: courier
  Parameters: (?a - courier ?from - loc ?to - loc)
  Preconditions: (at ?a ?from)
  Effects: (not (at ?a ?from)) (at ?a ?to)
- For initial facts, provide predicate names and ground atoms, e.g.:
  (at courier1 locA)
  (package pkg1)
  (at pkg1 locA)

Important constraints I'll follow when generating PDDL:
- I will only use :requirements { :strips :typing :negative-preconditions } (and :action-costs only if you explicitly require/action-costs data).
- I will preserve agent actions as distinct actions (no merging) and maintain the intended semantics.
- Natural-language preferences will be encoded as hard constraints (either by forbidden states or required ordering encoded into preconditions), per your instruction.
- I will document any assumptions I must make to resolve ambiguity. I will not invent new actions or availability beyond what you provide.
- I will produce one <domain></domain> block and one or more <problem></problem> blocks matching each scenario you provide.
- I will not include placeholders such as '...' or 'None'.

If you want, you may also supply the preferred typing hierarchy (e.g., agent, loc, item) or I can infer reasonable types from the inputs.

Example of minimal submission you could give (small sample):
- Public action model:
  - move: agent can move between locations if connected. Params (?ag - agent ?from - loc ?to - loc). Pre: (at ?ag ?from) (connected ?from ?to). Eff: (not (at ?ag ?from)) (at ?ag ?to).
  - pickup: courier picks up item at same location. Params (?c - courier ?p - package ?l - loc). Pre: (at ?c ?l) (at ?p ?l) (freehand ?c). Eff: (holding ?c ?p) (not (at ?p ?l)) (not (freehand ?c)).
  - deliver: courier delivers package at a location. Params (?c - courier ?p - package ?l - loc). Pre: (holding ?c ?p) (at ?c ?l) (destination ?p ?l). Eff: (delivered ?p) (not (holding ?c ?p)) (freehand ?c).

- Analyst_A initial facts:
  (connected locA locB)
  (connected locB locC)
  (at courier1 locA)
  (at pkg1 locA)
  (destination pkg1 locC)
  (freehand courier1)

- Analyst_B constraints:
  - courier1 must not pass through locB (preference -> treat as constraint: disallow move to locB for courier1).

- Scenario name: deliver-pkg1

When you provide the actual analysts' reports and public action model, I will:
- Resolve any reported ambiguities (documenting my assumptions).
- Produce a complete PDDL domain and one or more PDDL problems enclosed in <domain>...</domain> and <problem>...</problem> tags compatible with Fast Downwards.

Please paste the analysts' outputs and the public action model now.

It makes next(o1,o7) true and deletes next(o1,o6).\n    - Step 2 (sip o9 o1 o7) requires hand(o9), cats(o1), texture(o7), next(o9,o7) and next(o1,o7). next(o9,o7) is in the initial state and next(o1,o7) was added by step 1. It adds vase(o9,o1) and deletes next(o9,o7).\n    - Step 3 (memory o1 o7 o6) is applicable because cats(o1), spring(o7), spring(o6) and next(o1,o7) (present after step 1 and not deleted by step 2). It re-establishes next(o1,o6) and deletes next(o1,o7).\n    - Step 4 (paltry o9 o1 o6) is applicable because hand(o9), cats(o1), texture(o6), vase(o9,o1) (added by step 2 and not yet deleted), and next(o1,o6) (re-added by step 3) are true. It adds next(o9,o6). The plan leaves next(o8,o7) untouched (it is true initially).\n    - Final state contains next(o8,o7) (initial) and next(o9,o6) (added by step 4): goal satisfied.\n\nScenario 2 (concrete determination):\n  With the provided Scenario 2 initial facts and without adding any facts, the goal next object_9 object_8 is not reachable.\n  Reason: No action that produces next(o9,o8) has its preconditions fully satisfied by the given initial facts:\n    - memory requires cats(o9) and next(o9, something) \u2014 cats(o9) is absent.\n    - paltry / tightfisted require an existing next(x,o8) and vase(o9,x) \u2014 there is no next(*,o8) initially, and no vase facts.\n    - wretched could produce next(x,o8) for some x but requires collect facts pairing the involved objects with a stupendous object; the required collect pairs are missing for any candidate combination.\n  Conclusion: Scenario 2 is unsolvable under the given initial facts. To make it solvable one must add appropriate facts (examples: a next(*,object_8) fact and/or appropriate collect or vase facts or cats(object_9), depending on chosen plan). Any such assumption must be declared explicitly before generating a different problem instance."

NATURAL-PLAN sas_plan_1
------------------------------
Summary: execute the given 4-step plan exactly as provided. Each step lists a timestamp/duration (illustrative), the action taken, the preconditions and whether they are satisfied at that moment, the action effects, and the resulting key state changes. At the end I verify the goal (next object_8 object_7 AND next object_9 object_6) is satisfied.

Initial relevant facts (from the problem):
- cats: object_0, object_1
- hand: object_8, object_9
- spring: object_6, object_7
- texture: object_6, object_7
- next: object_0→object_6, object_1→object_6, object_4→object_6, object_5→object_7, object_8→object_7, object_9→object_7
- collect: object_6→object_2, object_7→object_3
- sneeze: object_4, object_5
- stupendous: object_2, object_3
- (No vase facts initially.)

Step 1 — t = 0 s, duration ≈ 1 s
Action: memory(object_1, object_6, object_7)

- Preconditions required by memory(x,y,z): (cats x), (spring y), (spring z), (next x y)
  - cats object_1 — TRUE (initial)
  - spring object_6 — TRUE (initial)
  - spring object_7 — TRUE (initial)
  - next object_1 object_6 — TRUE (initial)
- All preconditions satisfied → action is applicable.

- Effects of memory: add (next object_1 object_7); delete (next object_1 object_6).
- State changes produced:
  - next object_1 object_7 becomes TRUE.
  - next object_1 object_6 becomes FALSE.
- Key next facts after step 1 (relevant subset):
  - next object_1→object_7 (new)
  - next object_9→object_7 (unchanged)
  - next object_8→object_7 (unchanged)

Step 2 — t = 1 s, duration ≈ 1 s
Action: sip(object_9, object_1, object_7)

- Preconditions required by sip(x,y,z): (hand x), (cats y), (texture z), (next x z), (next y z)
  - hand object_9 — TRUE (initial)
  - cats object_1 — TRUE (initial)
  - texture object_7 — TRUE (initial)
  - next object_9 object_7 — TRUE (initial)
  - next object_1 object_7 — TRUE (established by Step 1)
- All preconditions satisfied → action is applicable.

- Effects of sip: add (vase object_9 object_1); delete (next object_9 object_7).
- State changes produced:
  - vase object_9 object_1 becomes TRUE.
  - next object_9 object_7 becomes FALSE (removed).
- Key next facts after step 2:
  - next object_1→object_7 (still TRUE)
  - next object_9→object_7 (now FALSE)
  - next object_8→object_7 (still TRUE)

Step 3 — t = 2 s, duration ≈ 1 s
Action: memory(object_1, object_7, object_6)

- Preconditions required by memory(x,y,z): (cats x), (spring y), (spring z), (next x y)
  - cats object_1 — TRUE
  - spring object_7 — TRUE
  - spring object_6 — TRUE
  - next object_1 object_7 — TRUE (from Step 1, unchanged by Step 2)
- All preconditions satisfied → action is applicable.

- Effects of memory: add (next object_1 object_6); delete (next object_1 object_7).
- State changes produced:
  - next object_1 object_6 becomes TRUE (restored).
  - next object_1 object_7 becomes FALSE (removed).
- Key next facts after step 3:
  - next object_1→object_6 (TRUE)
  - next object_9→object_7 (FALSE)
  - next object_8→object_7 (TRUE)

Step 4 — t = 3 s, duration ≈ 1 s
Action: paltry(object_9, object_1, object_6)

- Preconditions required by paltry(x,y,z): (hand x), (cats y), (texture z), (vase x y), (next y z)
  - hand object_9 — TRUE
  - cats object_1 — TRUE
  - texture object_6 — TRUE
  - vase object_9 object_1 — TRUE (created in Step 2)
  - next object_1 object_6 — TRUE (created in Step 3)
- All preconditions satisfied → action is applicable.

- Effects of paltry: add (next object_9 object_6); delete (vase object_9 object_1).
- State changes produced:
  - next object_9 object_6 becomes TRUE.
  - vase object_9 object_1 becomes FALSE (removed).

Final relevant facts after Step 4:
- next object_8 object_7 — TRUE (never removed; was true initially)
- next object_9 object_6 — TRUE (created in Step 4)
- Other next facts: next object_1 object_6 — TRUE (from Step 3); next object_1 object_7 — FALSE; next object_9 object_7 — FALSE.

Goal verification:
- Goal requires: (next object_8 object_7) AND (next object_9 object_6).
  - next object_8 object_7 — TRUE (initial and remained unchanged)
  - next object_9 object_6 — TRUE (established in Step 4)
- Both required facts are TRUE → the goal is satisfied.

Notes and assumptions:
- Timestamps/durations above are illustrative and only to satisfy the request to report time; they do not affect logical applicability.
- No missing facts or ambiguities prevented applying each action in turn; every action's preconditions were present when the action was executed.
- The action sequence is exactly the provided plan and is valid under the domain semantics; it reaches the stated goal.

NATURAL-PLAN sas_plan_2
------------------------------
Step 1 — time 0.0 to 1.0 (duration 1.0)
Action: clip object_9 object_4 object_7

Preconditions checked (all true in the initial state):
- hand object_9
- sneeze object_4
- texture object_7
- next object_4 object_7
- next object_9 object_7

Effects applied:
- Added: vase object_9 object_4
- Removed: next object_9 object_7

State after Step 1 (relevant facts):
- vase(object_9,object_4) is true
- next(object_9,object_7) is false (removed)
- next(object_4,object_7) remains true

Step 2 — time 1.0 to 2.0 (duration 1.0)
Action: wretched object_4 object_7 object_8 object_2

Preconditions checked (all true at time 1.0):
- sneeze object_4
- texture object_7
- texture object_8
- stupendous object_2
- next object_4 object_7
- collect object_7 object_2
- collect object_8 object_2

Effects applied:
- Added: next object_4 object_8
- Removed: next object_4 object_7

State after Step 2 (relevant facts):
- next(object_4,object_8) is true
- next(object_4,object_7) is false (removed)
- vase(object_9,object_4) remains true (from Step 1)

Step 3 — time 2.0 to 3.0 (duration 1.0)
Action: tightfisted object_9 object_4 object_8

Preconditions checked (all true at time 2.0):
- hand object_9
- sneeze object_4
- texture object_8
- next object_4 object_8
- vase object_9 object_4

Effects applied:
- Added: next object_9 object_8
- Removed: vase object_9 object_4

Final state (relevant facts):
- next(object_9,object_8) is true — the problem goal is achieved.
- vase(object_9,object_4) is now false (removed)

Plan summary:
- Actions executed in order: 
  1) clip object_9 object_4 object_7 (t=0.0→1.0)
  2) wretched object_4 object_7 object_8 object_2 (t=1.0→2.0)
  3) tightfisted object_9 object_4 object_8 (t=2.0→3.0)
- Unit cost: 3
- Goal (next object_9 object_8) satisfied at time 3.0.

PROBLEM
------------------------------
I am playing with a set of objects. Here are the actions I can do

Paltry object_0 object_1 object_2.
Sip object_0 object_1 object_2.
Clip object_0 object_1 object_2.
Wretched object_0 object_1 object_2 object_3.
Memory object_0 object_1 object_2.
Tightfisted object_0 object_1 object_2.

I have the following restrictions on my actions:
To perform paltry action, the following facts need to be true: hand object_0, cats object_1, texture object_2, vase object_0 object_1, and next object_1 object_2
Once paltry is performed the following facts will be true: next object_0 object_2
Once paltry is performed the following facts will be false: vase object_0 object_1
To perform sip action, the following facts need to be true: hand object_0, cats object_1, texture object_2, next object_0 object_2, and next object_1 object_2
Once sip is performed the following facts will be true: vase object_0 object_1
Once sip is performed the following facts will be false: next object_0 object_2
To perform clip action, the following facts need to be true: hand object_0, sneeze object_1, texture object_2, next object_1 object_2, and next object_0 object_2

FINAL-PLAN
------------------------------
I don't have the structured reports from agent_alpha and agent_beta in your message. I need those reports to produce a correct, conservative PDDL domain and problem that exactly reflect the agents' facts, objects, action schemata, constraints, and goals.

Please provide the two agents' structured reports (copy/paste), or at minimum include the following from each agent:

- Objects (names and types if any) appearing in their initial facts.
- Initial facts (state predicates) each agent reported.
- The six action schemata the agents described (for each action: name, parameters, preconditions, effects).
- Any constraints or hard preferences that must be enforced (e.g., "avoid X", "must do action A before B", "do not use resource R", "earliest time T" — treat these as hard constraints).
- The goal(s) each agent stated (as predicates).
- Any typing information you want included (optional).

If you prefer, paste the exact structured reports from agent_alpha and agent_beta and I will:
- Resolve naming mismatches conservatively (prefer existing names; do not invent objects),
- Merge initial facts (union),
- Encode the six actions, namespacing agent actions to keep them distinct,
- Produce a single PDDL domain (with :requirements limited to :strips, :typing, :negative-preconditions) and a single PDDL problem compatible with FastDownwards,
- Enclose the domain and problem in <domain> and </problem> tags as requested.

If you want, here is a minimal example template you can fill in for each agent to speed things up:

Agent report template (fill per agent):
- objects:
  - obj1 type1
  - obj2 type2
- initial facts (one per line, use predicate names and objects):
  - (at agent1 locA)
  - (loaded truck1 pkg1)
- actions (list exactly six across both agents; if an agent reports N actions, include them):
  - action_name(params): preconditions: { ... } effects: { ... }
- goals:
  - (delivered pkg1 locB)
- constraints (hard):
  - avoid using truck2
  - must not do actionX and actionY together

Send the reports and I'll produce the fully expanded PDDL domain and problem files.

NATURAL-PLAN sas_plan_1
------------------------------
Summary: the following 6-step, unit-cost plan executes the actions in the given order. Each step lists the action instance, its required preconditions (and whether they are satisfied at that moment), the effects that are applied, an estimated timestamp (one-second increments for readability), and the immediate state change. After step 4 and step 6 the two goals are reached.

Step 1 — t = 0s
Action: act_clip(object_9, object_4, object_6)
Meaning (schema clip): requires (hand ?x), (sneeze ?y), (texture ?z), (next ?y ?z), (next ?x ?z). Effects: add (vase ?x ?y), delete (next ?x ?z).
Preconditions at this time:
- hand object_9 — satisfied
- sneeze object_4 — satisfied
- texture object_6 — satisfied
- next object_4 object_6 — satisfied
- next object_9 object_6 — satisfied
Effects applied:
- Added: (vase object_9 object_4)
- Deleted: (next object_9 object_6)
State note: object_9 no longer points to object_6; a vase relation between object_9 and object_4 is created.

Step 2 — t = 1s
Action: act_wretched(object_4, object_8, object_9, object_3)
Meaning (schema wretched): requires (sneeze ?x), (texture ?y), (texture ?z), (stupendous ?w), (next ?x ?y), (collect ?y ?w), (collect ?z ?w). Effects: add (next ?x ?z), delete (next ?x ?y).
Preconditions at this time:
- sneeze object_4 — satisfied
- texture object_8 — satisfied
- texture object_9 — satisfied
- stupendous object_3 — satisfied
- next object_4 object_8 — satisfied
- collect object_8 object_3 — satisfied
- collect object_9 object_3 — satisfied
Effects applied:
- Added: (next object_4 object_9)
- Deleted: (next object_4 object_8)
State note: object_4’s successor changed from object_8 to object_9.

Step 3 — t = 2s
Action: act_clip(object_10, object_4, object_9)
Meaning (schema clip): same as Step 1.
Preconditions at this time:
- hand object_10 — satisfied
- sneeze object_4 — satisfied
- texture object_9 — satisfied
- next object_4 object_9 — satisfied (added in Step 2)
- next object_10 object_9 — satisfied (initial)
Effects applied:
- Added: (vase object_10 object_4)
- Deleted: (next object_10 object_9)
State note: object_10 no longer points to object_9; a vase relation between object_10 and object_4 is created.

Step 4 — t = 3s
Action: act_tightfisted(object_10, object_4, object_6)
Meaning (schema tightfisted): requires (hand ?x), (sneeze ?y), (texture ?z), (next ?y ?z), (vase ?x ?y). Effects: add (next ?x ?z), delete (vase ?x ?y).
Preconditions at this time:
- hand object_10 — satisfied
- sneeze object_4 — satisfied
- texture object_6 — satisfied
- next object_4 object_6 — satisfied (present from initial state; not deleted earlier)
- vase object_10 object_4 — satisfied (added in Step 3)
Effects applied:
- Added: (next object_10 object_6)
- Deleted: (vase object_10 object_4)
State note: object_10 now points to object_6.
Goal check: (next object_10 object_6) — ACHIEVED at this step.

Step 5 — t = 4s
Action: act_wretched(object_4, object_6, object_7, object_2)
Meaning (schema wretched): same as Step 2.
Preconditions at this time:
- sneeze object_4 — satisfied
- texture object_6 — satisfied
- texture object_7 — satisfied
- stupendous object_2 — satisfied
- next object_4 object_6 — satisfied (was present initially and not deleted until this step)
- collect object_6 object_2 — satisfied (initial)
- collect object_7 object_2 — satisfied (initial)
Effects applied:
- Added: (next object_4 object_7)
- Deleted: (next object_4 object_6)
State note: object_4’s successor changed from object_6 to object_7.

Step 6 — t = 5s
Action: act_tightfisted(object_9, object_4, object_7)
Meaning (schema tightfisted): same as Step 4.
Preconditions at this time:
- hand object_9 — satisfied
- sneeze object_4 — satisfied
- texture object_7 — satisfied
- next object_4 object_7 — satisfied (added in Step 5)
- vase object_9 object_4 — satisfied (added in Step 1 and not deleted until now)
Effects applied:
- Added: (next object_9 object_7)
- Deleted: (vase object_9 object_4)
State note: object_9 now points to object_7.
Goal check: (next object_9 object_7) — ACHIEVED at this step.

Final assessment
- Both required goals are achieved by this sequence:
  - next object_10 object_6 achieved at Step 4
  - next object_9 object_7 achieved at Step 6
- All preconditions for each step are satisfied at the time the step is executed (checked against the initial state and the intermediate effects of prior steps).
- Plan cost: 6 (unit-cost actions).
- No extra actions were added or removed; the plan follows the provided action sequence exactly.

================================================================================


FINAL-PLAN
------------------------------
I can’t generate the integrated PDDL domain/problem until you paste the scenario facts and action descriptions. Please provide the missing inputs in one message. Below I list exactly what I need and show a small example of the format to paste so I can produce a FastDownwards-compatible domain and problem (with action names prefixed by agent ids as you requested).

What I need from you (paste these):

1) Initial facts — a bullet list of ground atoms (predicates); include object names and types if you have them.
   - Example:
     - (at robot1 roomA)
     - (at box1 roomB)
     - (door roomA roomB closed)
     - Objects/types (optional but helpful): robot: robot1; box: box1; room: roomA, roomB

2) Declared goal — one sentence or a conjunctive set of literals.
   - Example:
     - Goal: (and (at box1 roomA))

3) Planned actions in order — an ordered list (each as agent-prefixed action name and parameters).
   - Example:
     - scenarioA-move(robot1 roomA roomB)
     - scenarioA-openDoor(robot1 roomA roomB)
     - scenarioA-pickUp(robot1 box1 roomB)

4) Public action descriptions — for each public action give:
   - Action name (must match names used in the plan and be prefixed by the origin agent id)
   - Parameters and types (if you use typing)
   - Public preconditions (conjunction of ground or parameterized literals)
   - Public effects: add-list (positive effects) and del-list (negative effects)
   - Example:
     - Action: scenarioA-move(?r - robot ?from - room ?to - room)
       - Public preconditions: (at ?r ?from) (door ?from ?to open)
       - Public effects: add: (at ?r ?to) ; del: (at ?r ?from)
     - Action: scenarioA-openDoor(?r - robot ?from - room ?to - room)
       - Public preconditions: (at ?r ?from) (door ?from ?to closed) (has ?r gripper)
       - Public effects: add: (door ?from ?to open) ; del: (door ?from ?to closed)

5) Any additional constraints (optional)
   - Resource limits, mutual-exclusion/parallelism constraints, or sensing/contingent actions you want treated as hard constraints.

Formatting notes and constraints I will enforce when generating PDDL:
- I will only use features supported by FastDownwards. The :requirements list will be limited to the supported flags (I will use :strips and :typing if you give types; optionally :negative-preconditions only if you include negated preconditions).
- Action names and predicate names must match exactly between domain and problem; I will prefix action names with the agent id you give (e.g., scenarioA-...).
- I will not invent any facts, objects, goals, or action availability beyond what you provide.
- If you do not provide object/type lists, I will infer objects that appear in the facts and actions but will not invent new ones.
- Preferences expressed as soft natural-language will be encoded as hard constraints only if you explicitly ask.

If you want, paste your scenario now using the examples above and I will produce:
- A concise fact list
- The declared goal
- The ordered plan steps
- For each step, whether each public precondition is satisfied when simulating from the initial facts and earlier actions (and which preconditions are missing)
- A single PDDL domain and a single PDDL problem file enclosed in <domain></domain> and <problem></problem> tags, FastDownwards-compatible.

If you prefer, you can also paste only the facts & actions for scenarioA and mention that scenarioB facts are private/absent — I will still produce a domain/problem from the public information you provide.

Achieving next o9 o7 would require an action that adds next ?o0 ?o2 with ?o0 = o9 and ?o2 = o7. All domain actions that add next facts require either:\n   - memory: requires cats o9 (not present)\n   - wretched: requires sneeze o9 (not present)\n   - paltry/tightfisted: require vase o9 ? (no vase with subject o9 exists and creating such a vase via clip would require sneeze o9)\n  No action creates sneeze or cats facts; no initial fact provides sneeze o9 or cats o9. Therefore next o9 o7 appears unreachable from the provided initial facts and available actions. Conclusion: scenarioB's combined goal cannot be fully achieved; next object_10 object_5 is already true, next object_9 object_7 is unattainable given the facts/actions.\nOverall combined solution: scenarioA's provided plan (as listed) achieves next object_10 object_6. ScenarioB's goal is only partially satisfied (next object_10 object_5 true initially); next object_9 object_7 is not achievable with the given initial facts and operators."

NATURAL-PLAN sas_plan_1
------------------------------
Plan summary (timestamps assigned for clarity; each action assumed to take 1 time unit):

Step 1 — t=0 → t=1
Action: (scenarioa-sip object_9 object_0 object_8)
- Natural-language: Agent scenarioA performs "sip" with hand object_9, using cats object_0 and texture object_8.
- Preconditions checked:
  - hand object_9 — present in initial state.
  - cats object_0 — present in initial state.
  - texture object_8 — present in initial state.
  - next object_9 object_8 — present in initial state.
  - next object_0 object_8 — present in initial state.
  => All preconditions satisfied.
- Effects:
  - Add: vase object_9 object_0
  - Remove: next object_9 object_8
- Notes: after this step vase(object_9,object_0) is true and next(object_9,object_8) is no longer true.

Step 2 — t=1 → t=2
Action: (scenarioa-paltry object_9 object_0 object_7)
- Natural-language: Agent scenarioA performs "paltry" with hand object_9, cats object_0, and texture object_7.
- Preconditions checked:
  - hand object_9 — true (initial).
  - cats object_0 — true (initial).
  - texture object_7 — true (initial).
  - vase object_9 object_0 — became true in Step 1.
  - next object_0 object_7 — present in initial state.
  => All preconditions satisfied.
- Effects:
  - Add: next object_9 object_7
  - Remove: vase object_9 object_0
- Notes: next(object_9,object_7) is now true (this satisfies the goal next object_9 object_7). vase(object_9,object_0) is removed.

Step 3 — t=2 → t=3
Action: (scenarioa-wretched object_4 object_8 object_9 object_3)
- Natural-language: Agent scenarioA performs "wretched" with sneeze object_4, textures object_8 and object_9, stupendous object_3.
- Preconditions checked:
  - sneeze object_4 — present in initial state.
  - texture object_8 — present in initial state.
  - texture object_9 — present in initial state.
  - stupendous object_3 — present in initial state.
  - next object_4 object_8 — present in initial state.
  - collect object_8 object_3 — present in initial state.
  - collect object_9 object_3 — present in initial state.
  => All preconditions satisfied.
- Effects:
  - Add: next object_4 object_9
  - Remove: next object_4 object_8
- Notes: next(object_4,object_9) now true; next(object_4,object_8) removed.

Step 4 — t=3 → t=4
Action: (scenarioa-clip object_10 object_4 object_9)
- Natural-language: Agent scenarioA performs "clip" with hand object_10, sneeze object_4, texture object_9.
- Preconditions checked:
  - hand object_10 — present in initial state.
  - sneeze object_4 — present in initial state.
  - texture object_9 — present in initial state.
  - next object_4 object_9 — added in Step 3.
  - next object_10 object_9 — present in initial state.
  => All preconditions satisfied.
- Effects:
  - Add: vase object_10 object_4
  - Remove: next object_10 object_9
- Notes: vase(object_10,object_4) becomes true; next(object_10,object_9) is removed.

Step 5 — t=4 → t=5
Action: (scenarioa-tightfisted object_10 object_4 object_6)
- Natural-language: Agent scenarioA performs "tightfisted" with hand object_10, sneeze object_4, texture object_6, using vase object_10 object_4.
- Preconditions checked:
  - hand object_10 — present in initial state.
  - sneeze object_4 — present in initial state.
  - texture object_6 — present in initial state.
  - next object_4 object_6 — present in initial state (was never removed).
  - vase object_10 object_4 — added in Step 4.
  => All preconditions satisfied.
- Effects:
  - Add: next object_10 object_6
  - Remove: vase object_10 object_4
- Notes: next(object_10,object_6) becomes true (this satisfies the goal next object_10 object_6). vase(object_10,object_4) is removed.

Final state relative to goals (after t=5):
- Goal next object_10 object_6 — achieved in Step 5.
- Goal next object_10 object_5 — was present in the initial state and remained unchanged.
- Goal next object_9 object_7 — achieved in Step 2.

All plan steps matched exactly, preconditions were provable from the initial facts plus earlier action effects, and the final goals are satisfied. Total actions: 5; total duration (as timestamped) = 5 time units.

  ; ACTIONS
  ; ---------------------------------------------------------------------
  ; Notes on modelling choices and conflict resolutions:
  ; - The public information referenced actions named: paltry, sip, clip, wretched, memory, tightfisted.
  ;   Their natural-language descriptions were not provided as formal PDDL; the following formalizations
  ;   are consistent, distinct, and preserve the intended semantics inferred from names:
  ;     * paltry: transfer a small (paltry) object (e.g., coin) from one agent to another. Blocked if giver is tightfisted.
  ;     * sip: agent drinks the water from a container they hold; removes thirst and container content.
  ;     * clip: attach a paperclip to a note when the agent has both items; sets is-clipped on the note.
  ;     * memory: observer records / remembers a clipped note; requires the note to be clipped and the observer present
  ;               (we model presence implicitly by possession/holding; for simplicity we require nothing additional here).
  ;     * wretched: toggles a tightfisted agent into a wretched state and removes their tightfisted constraint,
  ;                 representing that a hard preference was overcome (this action was introduced to allow paltry to occur).
  ;     * tightfisted: mark an agent as tightfisted (captures the 'would rather not give' preference as a hard constraint).
  ;
  ; - Temporal and soft preferences in the original natural language are encoded as hard predicates and preconditions:
  ;   e.g., an agent initially marked (is-tightfisted X) cannot perform paltry until an action (wretched) removes that.
  ; - All actions use only STRIPS-style add/delete effects and (optional) negative preconditions to stay compatible
  ;   with the requested :requirements.

  ; Problem comment: initial situation built by integrating the observer and manipulator facts.
  ; Assumptions made when integrating:
  ; - Two agents exist: observer and manipulator.
  ; - manipulator initially holds a cup (with water), a paperclip, a note, and a coin.
  ; - manipulator is initially thirsty and tightfisted (the latter encodes a preference to avoid giving).
  ; - observer initially has no coin and has not remembered the note yet.
  ; - 'water' is modelled as an object of type object.
  ; - The plan goal requires the note to be clipped, the observer to have remembered it, the manipulator not thirsty,
  ;   and the coin to have been transferred to the observer. Because tightfisted is a hard constraint, a wretched action
  ;   is provided to remove it (i.e., no paltry transfer can occur while is-tightfisted holds).
  ;
  ; These choices resolve missing formal details from the source descriptions and encode natural-language preferences as
  ; hard constraints, per instructions.

PROBLEM

(define (problem orchestrated-problem)
  (:domain orchestrated-domain)

  ; Problem comment: initial situation built by integrating the observer and manipulator facts.
  ; Assumptions made when integrating:
  ; - Two agents exist: observer and manipulator.
  ; - manipulator initially holds a cup (with water), a paperclip, a note, and a coin.
  ; - manipulator is initially thirsty and tightfisted (the latter encodes a preference to avoid giving).
  ; - observer initially has no coin and has not remembered the note yet.
  ; - 'water' is modelled as an object of type object.
  ; - The plan goal requires the note to be clipped, the observer to have remembered it, the manipulator not thirsty,
  ;   and the coin to have been transferred to the observer. Because tightfisted is a hard constraint, a wretched action
  ;   is provided to remove it (i.e., no paltry transfer can occur while is-tightfisted holds).
  ;
  ; These choices resolve missing formal details from the source descriptions and encode natural-language preferences as
  ; hard constraints, per instructions.

    (is-tightfisted manipulator)

    ; No remembered facts initially
    ; (observer has no coin initially -> not listed in :init)
  )

  ; Goal: integrate objectives from both agents:
  ; - observer has remembered the (clipped) note
  ; - the note is clipped
  ; - manipulator is no longer thirsty (i.e., has sipped)
  ; - the coin has been transferred to the observer (paltry)

NATURAL-PLAN sas_plan_1
------------------------------
Planned execution (matches the provided plan exactly — 2 actions, unit cost):

Start time: t = 0.0s

1) t = 0.0s — Action: sip(object_9, object_0, object_5) — duration: 1.0s (estimated)
   - Meaning (human): Use object_9 (in hand) with object_0 (cats) at texture object_5 to perform the "sip" action.
   - Preconditions checked before executing:
     - hand object_9 (true)
     - cats object_0 (true)
     - texture object_5 (true)
     - next object_9 object_5 (true)
     - next object_0 object_5 (true)
   - Effects applied by this step:
     - Added: vase object_9 object_0
     - Removed: next object_9 object_5
   - Resulting notable facts after step 1:
     - vase(object_9, object_0) is now true
     - next(object_9, object_5) is no longer true

2) t = 1.0s — Action: paltry(object_9, object_0, object_7) — duration: 1.0s (estimated)
   - Meaning (human): With object_9 in hand and object_0 as the cats object, using texture object_7, perform the "paltry" action to move the relation from object_0→object_7 to object_9→object_7.
   - Preconditions checked before executing:
     - hand object_9 (true)
     - cats object_0 (true)
     - texture object_7 (true)
     - vase object_9 object_0 (true — created by step 1)
     - next object_0 object_7 (true)
   - Effects applied by this step:
     - Added: next object_9 object_7
     - Removed: vase object_9 object_0
   - Resulting notable facts after step 2:
     - next(object_9, object_7) is now true
     - vase(object_9, object_0) is no longer true

End time: t = 2.0s

Final check against the goal:
- next object_10 object_5 — true (present in the initial state and unchanged by the plan)
- next object_9 object_7 — true (established by step 2)

Goal achieved: both required next relations hold.
