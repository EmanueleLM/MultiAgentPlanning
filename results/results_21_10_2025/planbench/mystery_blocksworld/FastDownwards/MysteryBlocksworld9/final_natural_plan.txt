Plan (each action cost = 1 time unit; timestamps are cumulative start times):

Step 1 — time 0.0 (duration 1.0)
Action: clip_orchestrator(object_9, object_3, object_5)
Natural-language: Using hand object_9, clip (attach) sneeze-object object_3 at texture object_5.
Effects: + vase(object_9, object_3) ; - next(object_9, object_5)

Step 2 — time 1.0 (duration 1.0)
Action: wretched_orchestrator(object_3, object_5, object_6, object_1)
Natural-language: With sneeze object_3, change its neighbor from texture object_5 to texture object_6 (using stupendous object_1 and the collects for object_5 and object_6).
Effects: + next(object_3, object_6) ; - next(object_3, object_5)

Step 3 — time 2.0 (duration 1.0)
Action: tightfisted_orchestrator(object_9, object_3, object_6)
Natural-language: Using hand object_9 and the existing vase(object_9,object_3), move object_9 to be next to texture object_6 (consuming that vase relation).
Effects: + next(object_9, object_6) ; - vase(object_9, object_3)

Step 4 — time 3.0 (duration 1.0)
Action: wretched_orchestrator(object_4, object_8, object_9, object_3)
Natural-language: With sneeze object_4, change its neighbor from texture object_8 to texture object_9 (using stupendous object_3 and collects for object_8 and object_9).
Effects: + next(object_4, object_9) ; - next(object_4, object_8)

Step 5 — time 4.0 (duration 1.0)
Action: clip_orchestrator(object_11, object_4, object_9)
Natural-language: Using hand object_11, clip (attach) sneeze-object object_4 at texture object_9.
Effects: + vase(object_11, object_4) ; - next(object_11, object_9)

Step 6 — time 5.0 (duration 1.0)
Action: wretched_orchestrator(object_4, object_6, object_8, object_2)
Natural-language: With sneeze object_4, change its neighbor from texture object_6 to texture object_8 (using stupendous object_2 and collects for object_6 and object_8).
Effects: + next(object_4, object_8) ; - next(object_4, object_6)

Step 7 — time 6.0 (duration 1.0)
Action: tightfisted_orchestrator(object_11, object_4, object_8)
Natural-language: Using hand object_11 and the existing vase(object_11,object_4), move object_11 to be next to texture object_8 (consuming that vase relation).
Effects: + next(object_11, object_8) ; - vase(object_11, object_4)

Step 8 — time 7.0 (duration 1.0)
Action: wretched_orchestrator(object_3, object_6, object_7, object_2)
Natural-language: With sneeze object_3, change its neighbor from texture object_6 to texture object_7 (using stupendous object_2 and collects for object_6 and object_7).
Effects: + next(object_3, object_7) ; - next(object_3, object_6)

Step 9 — time 8.0 (duration 1.0)
Action: memory_orchestrator(object_1, object_6, object_7)
Natural-language: For cat object_1, update its next from spring object_6 to spring object_7.
Effects: + next(object_1, object_7) ; - next(object_1, object_6)

Step 10 — time 9.0 (duration 1.0)
Action: sip_orchestrator(object_10, object_0, object_5)
Natural-language: Using hand object_10 and with object_0 at texture object_5, form vase(object_10, object_0) and remove object_10's next relation to object_5.
Effects: + vase(object_10, object_0) ; - next(object_10, object_5)

Step 11 — time 10.0 (duration 1.0)
Action: memory_orchestrator(object_0, object_8, object_7)
Natural-language: For cat object_0, update its next from spring object_8 to spring object_7.
Effects: + next(object_0, object_7) ; - next(object_0, object_8)

Step 12 — time 11.0 (duration 1.0)
Action: paltry_orchestrator(object_10, object_0, object_7)
Natural-language: Using hand object_10 and the vase(object_10,object_0) plus object_0 being next to object_7, make object_10 next to object_7 and remove the vase relation.
Effects: + next(object_10, object_7) ; - vase(object_10, object_0)

Final check (goal predicates):
- next(object_10, object_6): true from initial state (not removed by plan) — goal satisfied.
- next(object_9, object_6): achieved at Step 3 — goal satisfied.
- next(object_10, object_7): achieved at Step 12 — goal satisfied.
- next(object_11, object_8): achieved at Step 7 — goal satisfied.

All four goal predicates are satisfied by the above sequence.
