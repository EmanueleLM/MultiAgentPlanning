Initial state (scenario variant used): cats object_0, cats object_1, collect object_6 object_2, collect object_7 object_3, hand object_8, next object_0 object_6, next object_1 object_6, next object_4 object_6, next object_5 object_7, next object_8 object_7, sneeze object_4, sneeze object_5, spring object_6, spring object_7, stupendous object_2, stupendous object_3, texture object_6, texture object_7. No vase facts initially.

Plan (each step duration = 1.0s, timestamps cumulative):

Step 1 — time 0.0s → 1.0s
Action: memory object_1 object_6 object_7
- Parameters: o0=object_1, o1=object_6, o2=object_7
- Preconditions checked and satisfied:
  - (cats object_1) — true in initial state
  - (spring object_6) — true in initial state
  - (spring object_7) — true in initial state
  - (next object_1 object_6) — true in initial state
- Effects applied:
  - Add (next object_1 object_7)
  - Delete (next object_1 object_6)
- Resulting relevant facts after step: next object_1 object_7 (added); next object_1 object_6 (removed).

Step 2 — time 1.0s → 2.0s
Action: sip object_8 object_1 object_7
- Parameters: o0=object_8, o1=object_1, o2=object_7
- Preconditions checked and satisfied (sources noted):
  - (hand object_8) — true in initial state
  - (cats object_1) — true in initial state
  - (texture object_7) — true in initial state
  - (next object_8 object_7) — true in initial state
  - (next object_1 object_7) — added by Step 1
- Effects applied:
  - Add (vase object_8 object_1)
  - Delete (next object_8 object_7)
- Resulting relevant facts after step: vase object_8 object_1 (added); next object_8 object_7 (removed).

Step 3 — time 2.0s → 3.0s
Action: memory object_1 object_7 object_6
- Parameters: o0=object_1, o1=object_7, o2=object_6
- Preconditions checked and satisfied:
  - (cats object_1) — true in initial state
  - (spring object_7) — true in initial state
  - (spring object_6) — true in initial state
  - (next object_1 object_7) — present after Step 1 (not yet deleted until this step’s effect)
- Effects applied:
  - Add (next object_1 object_6)
  - Delete (next object_1 object_7)
- Resulting relevant facts after step: next object_1 object_6 (re-added); next object_1 object_7 (removed).

Step 4 — time 3.0s → 4.0s
Action: paltry object_8 object_1 object_6
- Parameters: o0=object_8, o1=object_1, o2=object_6
- Preconditions checked and satisfied:
  - (hand object_8) — true in initial state
  - (cats object_1) — true in initial state
  - (texture object_6) — true in initial state
  - (vase object_8 object_1) — added by Step 2
  - (next object_1 object_6) — re-added by Step 3
- Effects applied:
  - Add (next object_8 object_6)
  - Delete (vase object_8 object_1)
- Resulting relevant facts after step: next object_8 object_6 (added); vase object_8 object_1 (removed).

Goal check:
- The goal (next object_8 object_6) is achieved at the end of Step 4 (time 4.0s).
