1) Time 0.0 — 1.0 (duration 1.0)
   Action: sip_a object_8 object_0 object_7
   Agent: planner_A (sip action instance)
   Parameter mapping:
     - ?o0 = object_8
     - ?o1 = object_0
     - ?o2 = object_7
   Preconditions checked (all required):
     - (hand object_8)        — true (initial)
     - (cats object_0)        — true (initial)
     - (texture object_7)     — true (initial)
     - (next object_8 object_7) — true (initial)
     - (next object_0 object_7) — true (initial)
   Effects applied:
     - Add: (vase object_8 object_0)
     - Delete: (next object_8 object_7)
   Relevant resulting facts after step:
     - (vase object_8 object_0) is now true
     - (next object_8 object_7) has been removed
     - All other facts unchanged unless listed above

2) Time 1.0 — 2.0 (duration 1.0)
   Action: paltry_a object_8 object_0 object_6
   Agent: planner_A (paltry action instance)
   Parameter mapping:
     - ?o0 = object_8
     - ?o1 = object_0
     - ?o2 = object_6
   Preconditions checked (all required):
     - (hand object_8)            — true (initial, unchanged)
     - (cats object_0)            — true (initial)
     - (texture object_6)         — true (initial)
     - (vase object_8 object_0)   — true (added by step 1)
     - (next object_0 object_6)   — true (present in initial state)
   Effects applied:
     - Add: (next object_8 object_6)
     - Delete: (vase object_8 object_0)
   Relevant resulting facts after step:
     - (next object_8 object_6) is now true (goal-related)
     - (vase object_8 object_0) has been removed
     - (next object_8 object_7) remains deleted from step 1

Final status (time 2.0):
   - Goal predicates required:
     - (next object_7 object_6) — true (present in initial state)
     - (next object_8 object_6) — true (established by step 2)
   - Both goal conditions are satisfied.
   - Plan cost: 2 (unit cost), total duration = 2.0 time units.
   - Warnings/notes: No unmet preconditions or contradictions were encountered; both actions were applicable in sequence given the stated initial facts.
