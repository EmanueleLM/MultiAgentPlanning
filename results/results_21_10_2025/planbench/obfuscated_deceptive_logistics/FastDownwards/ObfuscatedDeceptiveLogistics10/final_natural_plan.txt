Plan (human-readable, step-by-step). Each step follows the given PDDL plan exactly. Timestamps are illustrative, showing a simple sequential ordering (1 second per action).

Step 1 — [00:00:00 → 00:00:01] p1-clip object_11 object_4 object_6
- Actor: player1 (p1-clip)
- Parameters: o0=object_11, o1=object_4, o2=object_6
- Preconditions checked:
  - (hand object_11) — satisfied (initial)
  - (sneeze object_4) — satisfied (initial)
  - (texture object_6) — satisfied (initial)
  - (next object_4 object_6) — satisfied (initial)
  - (next object_11 object_6) — satisfied (initial)
- Missing preconditions: none
- Effects applied:
  - Added: (vase object_11 object_4)
  - Removed: (next object_11 object_6)
- Notes: successful; creates vase linking object_11→object_4 and removes object_11’s next relation to object_6.

Step 2 — [00:00:01 → 00:00:02] p1-wretched object_4 object_6 object_8 object_2
- Actor: player1 (p1-wretched)
- Parameters: o0=object_4, o1=object_6, o2=object_8, o3=object_2
- Preconditions checked:
  - (sneeze object_4) — satisfied (initial)
  - (texture object_6) — satisfied (initial)
  - (texture object_8) — satisfied (initial)
  - (stupendous object_2) — satisfied (initial)
  - (next object_4 object_6) — satisfied (it existed at start and was not changed by Step 1)
  - (collect object_6 object_2) — satisfied (initial)
  - (collect object_8 object_2) — satisfied (initial)
- Missing preconditions: none
- Effects applied:
  - Added: (next object_4 object_8)
  - Removed: (next object_4 object_6)
- Notes: re-routes object_4’s next from object_6 to object_8.

Step 3 — [00:00:02 → 00:00:03] p1-tightfisted object_11 object_4 object_8
- Actor: player1 (p1-tightfisted)
- Parameters: o0=object_11, o1=object_4, o2=object_8
- Preconditions checked:
  - (hand object_11) — satisfied (initial)
  - (sneeze object_4) — satisfied (initial)
  - (texture object_8) — satisfied (initial)
  - (next object_4 object_8) — satisfied (added by Step 2)
  - (vase object_11 object_4) — satisfied (added by Step 1)
- Missing preconditions: none
- Effects applied:
  - Added: (next object_11 object_8)
  - Removed: (vase object_11 object_4)
- Notes: creates the goal fact (next object_11 object_8).

Step 4 — [00:00:03 → 00:00:04] p1-clip object_10 object_4 object_8
- Actor: player1 (p1-clip)
- Parameters: o0=object_10, o1=object_4, o2=object_8
- Preconditions checked:
  - (hand object_10) — satisfied (initial)
  - (sneeze object_4) — satisfied (initial)
  - (texture object_8) — satisfied (initial)
  - (next object_4 object_8) — satisfied (added by Step 2)
  - (next object_10 object_8) — satisfied (initial)
- Missing preconditions: none
- Effects applied:
  - Added: (vase object_10 object_4)
  - Removed: (next object_10 object_8)
- Notes: prepares object_10 by creating a vase relation to object_4 and clears its previous next to object_8.

Step 5 — [00:00:04 → 00:00:05] p1-tightfisted object_10 object_4 object_7
- Actor: player1 (p1-tightfisted)
- Parameters: o0=object_10, o1=object_4, o2=object_7
- Preconditions checked:
  - (hand object_10) — satisfied (initial)
  - (sneeze object_4) — satisfied (initial)
  - (texture object_7) — satisfied (initial)
  - (next object_4 object_7) — satisfied (initial)
  - (vase object_10 object_4) — satisfied (added by Step 4)
- Missing preconditions: none
- Effects applied:
  - Added: (next object_10 object_7)
  - Removed: (vase object_10 object_4)
- Notes: creates the goal fact (next object_10 object_7).

Final verification
- Goal required: (next object_10 object_7) and (next object_11 object_8)
- Both facts are present after Step 5:
  - (next object_11 object_8) was added in Step 3
  - (next object_10 object_7) was added in Step 5
- Total actions executed: 5 (unit cost each). Total cost = 5.

This sequence follows the provided plan exactly, reports preconditions/effects for each action, and reaches the specified goal.
