Summary: the following 13-step human-readable action sequence exactly follows the given plan. Each step lists the action, the concrete object bindings, the (checked) preconditions that are true when the step executes, the effects applied to the state, a timestamp (unit duration = 1 per step) and a running note when a goal fact is achieved. Total steps = 13, total time = 13 units, unit cost per action = 1, total cost = 13.

Initial facts (variant A): cats object_0; collect object_5 object_1; collect object_6 object_1; collect object_7 object_2; collect object_8 object_2; hand object_10, hand object_11, hand object_9; next object_0 object_5; next object_10 object_8; next object_11 object_6; next object_3 object_5; next object_4 object_7; next object_9 object_5; sneeze object_3, sneeze object_4; spring object_5, spring object_7; stupendous object_1, stupendous object_2; texture object_5, texture object_6, texture object_7, texture object_8.

Step 1 — t = 1 (duration 1)
Action: wretched object_4 object_7 object_8 object_2
- Binding: sneeze = object_4, t1 = object_7, t2 = object_8, stup = object_2
- Preconditions checked and true: sneeze(object_4), texture(object_7), texture(object_8), stupendous(object_2), next(object_4,object_7), collect(object_7,object_2), collect(object_8,object_2)
- Effects applied: add next(object_4,object_8); delete next(object_4,object_7)
- Notes: object_4's "next" pointer is moved from object_7 → object_8.

Step 2 — t = 2 (duration 1)
Action: clip object_10 object_4 object_8
- Binding: hand = object_10, sneeze = object_4, texture = object_8
- Preconditions checked and true: hand(object_10), sneeze(object_4), texture(object_8), next(object_4,object_8) [from step 1], next(object_10,object_8) [initial]
- Effects applied: add vase(object_10,object_4); delete next(object_10,object_8)
- Notes: object_10 loses its link to object_8 and gains vase(object_10,object_4).

Step 3 — t = 3 (duration 1)
Action: wretched object_4 object_8 object_7 object_2
- Binding: sneeze = object_4, t1 = object_8, t2 = object_7, stup = object_2
- Preconditions checked and true: sneeze(object_4), texture(object_8), texture(object_7), stupendous(object_2), next(object_4,object_8) [from step 1], collect(object_8,object_2), collect(object_7,object_2)
- Effects applied: add next(object_4,object_7); delete next(object_4,object_8)
- Notes: object_4's "next" pointer is restored back to object_7.

Step 4 — t = 4 (duration 1)
Action: tightfisted object_10 object_4 object_7
- Binding: hand = object_10, sneeze = object_4, texture = object_7
- Preconditions checked and true: hand(object_10), sneeze(object_4), texture(object_7), next(object_4,object_7) [from step 3], vase(object_10,object_4) [from step 2]
- Effects applied: add next(object_10,object_7); delete vase(object_10,object_4)
- Notes: next(object_10,object_7) is produced here — one of the three goal facts is now true.

Step 5 — t = 5 (duration 1)
Action: wretched object_3 object_5 object_6 object_1
- Binding: sneeze = object_3, t1 = object_5, t2 = object_6, stup = object_1
- Preconditions checked and true: sneeze(object_3), texture(object_5), texture(object_6), stupendous(object_1), next(object_3,object_5) [initial], collect(object_5,object_1), collect(object_6,object_1)
- Effects applied: add next(object_3,object_6); delete next(object_3,object_5)
- Notes: object_3's "next" pointer moves from object_5 → object_6.

Step 6 — t = 6 (duration 1)
Action: clip object_11 object_3 object_6
- Binding: hand = object_11, sneeze = object_3, texture = object_6
- Preconditions checked and true: hand(object_11), sneeze(object_3), texture(object_6), next(object_3,object_6) [from step 5], next(object_11,object_6) [initial]
- Effects applied: add vase(object_11,object_3); delete next(object_11,object_6)
- Notes: object_11 loses its link to object_6 and gains vase(object_11,object_3).

Step 7 — t = 7 (duration 1)
Action: wretched object_3 object_6 object_5 object_1
- Binding: sneeze = object_3, t1 = object_6, t2 = object_5, stup = object_1
- Preconditions checked and true: sneeze(object_3), texture(object_6), texture(object_5), stupendous(object_1), next(object_3,object_6) [from step 5], collect(object_6,object_1), collect(object_5,object_1)
- Effects applied: add next(object_3,object_5); delete next(object_3,object_6)
- Notes: object_3's "next" pointer is returned back to object_5.

Step 8 — t = 8 (duration 1)
Action: tightfisted object_11 object_3 object_5
- Binding: hand = object_11, sneeze = object_3, texture = object_5
- Preconditions checked and true: hand(object_11), sneeze(object_3), texture(object_5), next(object_3,object_5) [from step 7], vase(object_11,object_3) [from step 6]
- Effects applied: add next(object_11,object_5); delete vase(object_11,object_3)
- Notes: object_11 now points to object_5 (next(object_11,object_5)).

Step 9 — t = 9 (duration 1)
Action: sip object_9 object_0 object_5
- Binding: hand = object_9, cats = object_0, texture = object_5
- Preconditions checked and true: hand(object_9), cats(object_0), texture(object_5), next(object_9,object_5) [initial], next(object_0,object_5) [initial]
- Effects applied: add vase(object_9,object_0); delete next(object_9,object_5)
- Notes: object_9 loses its link to object_5; vase(object_9,object_0) is now present.

Step 10 — t = 10 (duration 1)
Action: sip object_11 object_0 object_5
- Binding: hand = object_11, cats = object_0, texture = object_5
- Preconditions checked and true: hand(object_11), cats(object_0), texture(object_5), next(object_11,object_5) [from step 8], next(object_0,object_5) [initial]
- Effects applied: add vase(object_11,object_0); delete next(object_11,object_5)
- Notes: object_11 loses its link to object_5; vase(object_11,object_0) is now present.

Step 11 — t = 11 (duration 1)
Action: memory object_0 object_5 object_7
- Binding: cats = object_0, spring s1 = object_5, spring s2 = object_7
- Preconditions checked and true: cats(object_0), spring(object_5), spring(object_7), next(object_0,object_5) [initial]
- Effects applied: add next(object_0,object_7); delete next(object_0,object_5)
- Notes: object_0's "next" pointer is moved to object_7. This creates the precondition used by subsequent paltry actions.

Step 12 — t = 12 (duration 1)
Action: paltry object_9 object_0 object_7
- Binding: hand = object_9, cats = object_0, texture = object_7
- Preconditions checked and true: hand(object_9), cats(object_0), texture(object_7), vase(object_9,object_0) [from step 9], next(object_0,object_7) [from step 11]
- Effects applied: add next(object_9,object_7); delete vase(object_9,object_0)
- Notes: next(object_9,object_7) is produced here — second goal fact achieved.

Step 13 — t = 13 (duration 1)
Action: paltry object_11 object_0 object_7
- Binding: hand = object_11, cats = object_0, texture = object_7
- Preconditions checked and true: hand(object_11), cats(object_0), texture(object_7), vase(object_11,object_0) [from step 10], next(object_0,object_7) [from step 11]
- Effects applied: add next(object_11,object_7); delete vase(object_11,object_0)
- Notes: next(object_11,object_7) is produced here — third goal fact achieved.

Final check (after step 13)
- Goal facts required: next(object_10,object_7), next(object_11,object_7), next(object_9,object_7)
- All are true:
  - next(object_10,object_7) produced at Step 4
  - next(object_11,object_7) produced at Step 13
  - next(object_9,object_7) produced at Step 12

Execution summary
- Steps executed in order exactly as provided in the plan (no additions or deletions).
- Per-step timestamps: steps at t = 1..13, each with duration = 1 unit (conservative, uniform timing).
- Total time = 13 units; total cost = 13 (unit cost per action).
- All action preconditions were present when each action executed (checked against the Variant A initial facts and intermediate effects).
- Final goal achieved at completion of step 13.

If you want this same sequence presented in a compact numbered checklist or with different timestamp granularity, I can reformat accordingly.
