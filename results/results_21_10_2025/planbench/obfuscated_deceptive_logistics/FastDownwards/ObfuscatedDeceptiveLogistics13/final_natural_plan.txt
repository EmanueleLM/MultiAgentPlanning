Below is a clear, step-by-step, human-readable trace of the provided plan. Each step corresponds exactly to one action in the plan, with a timestamp (1s per step), a short natural-language description, and the formal effects (what the action adds and deletes) according to the domain specification. Preconditions are indicated and assumed satisfied at the time of execution because the given plan is valid.

The plan completes at t=19s and satisfies the goal: next object_10 object_7, next object_11 object_9, next object_12 object_8.

If you want, I can also produce a compact table of precondition/effect changes per object (state trace), or produce timestamps with finer granularity or different durations.
