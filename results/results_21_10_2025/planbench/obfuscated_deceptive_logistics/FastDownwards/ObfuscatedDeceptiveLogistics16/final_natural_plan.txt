Assumption for readability: each action is listed in plan order and is assigned a nominal duration of 1.0 time unit for timestamping. Step k starts at time (k-1).0 and ends at time k.0. I list for each step: action, parameter binding, required preconditions (short), and effects (adds / deletes). No actions were added or removed — the sequence matches the provided plan exactly.

Final status relevant to the goals (after t=22.0)
- (next object_10 object_8) — added at Step 15
- (next object_11 object_6) — added at Step 22
- (next object_12 object_8) — added at Step 14
- (next object_9 object_5) — added at Step 18

These four facts match the specified goal conjuncts. The plan above follows the given PDDL actions in the exact order provided; each step lists preconditions and effects and is timestamped under the uniform 1.0-unit-per-action assumption.
