Plan execution (11 steps). Each step lists: timestamp, action (with parameters exactly as in the plan), preconditions that enable the action (ground facts present at that time), the effects applied (deleted and added ground facts), and the relevant state change summary. Durations are listed as 1.0s per action for clarity; timestamps accumulate.

Initial relevant facts (from the problem file, before step 1):
- hand object_11
- cats object_0
- sneeze object_3
- sneeze object_4
- spring object_5
- spring object_8
- stupendous object_1
- stupendous object_2
- texture object_10, object_5, object_6, object_7, object_8, object_9
- collect object_10 object_2
- collect object_5 object_1
- collect object_6 object_1
- collect object_7 object_1
- collect object_8 object_2
- collect object_9 object_2
- next object_0 object_8
- next object_11 object_6
- next object_3 object_7
- next object_4 object_8
- (no vase facts initially)

Step 1 — time 0.0s → 1.0s
Action: wretched object_3 object_7 object_6 object_1
- Preconditions (ground facts required and present): sneeze object_3; texture object_7; texture object_6; stupendous object_1; next object_3 object_7; collect object_7 object_1; collect object_6 object_1.
- Effects applied: delete (next object_3 object_7); add (next object_3 object_6).
- State change summary: object_3's "next" target changes from object_7 to object_6.

Step 2 — time 1.0s → 2.0s
Action: clip object_11 object_3 object_6
- Preconditions: hand object_11; sneeze object_3; texture object_6; next object_3 object_6; next object_11 object_6.
- Effects applied: add (vase object_11 object_3); delete (next object_11 object_6).
- State change summary: a vase between object_11 and object_3 is created; object_11 no longer points to object_6.

Step 3 — time 2.0s → 3.0s
Action: wretched object_3 object_6 object_5 object_1
- Preconditions: sneeze object_3; texture object_6; texture object_5; stupendous object_1; next object_3 object_6; collect object_6 object_1; collect object_5 object_1.
- Effects applied: delete (next object_3 object_6); add (next object_3 object_5).
- State change summary: object_3's "next" target changes from object_6 to object_5.

Step 4 — time 3.0s → 4.0s
Action: tightfisted object_11 object_3 object_5
- Preconditions: hand object_11; sneeze object_3; texture object_5; next object_3 object_5; vase object_11 object_3.
- Effects applied: delete (vase object_11 object_3); add (next object_11 object_5).
- State change summary: the vase (object_11,object_3) is removed; object_11 now points to object_5.

Step 5 — time 4.0s → 5.0s
Action: memory object_0 object_8 object_5
- Preconditions: cats object_0; spring object_8; spring object_5; next object_0 object_8.
- Effects applied: delete (next object_0 object_8); add (next object_0 object_5).
- State change summary: object_0's "next" target changes from object_8 to object_5.

Step 6 — time 5.0s → 6.0s
Action: sip object_11 object_0 object_5
- Preconditions: hand object_11; cats object_0; texture object_5; next object_11 object_5; next object_0 object_5.
- Effects applied: add (vase object_11 object_0); delete (next object_11 object_5).
- State change summary: a vase between object_11 and object_0 is created; object_11 no longer points to object_5.

Step 7 — time 6.0s → 7.0s
Action: memory object_0 object_5 object_8
- Preconditions: cats object_0; spring object_5; spring object_8; next object_0 object_5.
- Effects applied: delete (next object_0 object_5); add (next object_0 object_8).
- State change summary: object_0's "next" target changes from object_5 back to object_8.

Step 8 — time 7.0s → 8.0s
Action: paltry object_11 object_0 object_8
- Preconditions: hand object_11; cats object_0; texture object_8; vase object_11 object_0; next object_0 object_8.
- Effects applied: delete (vase object_11 object_0); add (next object_11 object_8).
- State change summary: the vase (object_11,object_0) is removed; object_11 now points to object_8.

Step 9 — time 8.0s → 9.0s
Action: clip object_11 object_4 object_8
- Preconditions: hand object_11; sneeze object_4; texture object_8; next object_4 object_8; next object_11 object_8.
- Effects applied: add (vase object_11 object_4); delete (next object_11 object_8).
- State change summary: a vase between object_11 and object_4 is created; object_11 no longer points to object_8.

Step 10 — time 9.0s → 10.0s
Action: wretched object_4 object_8 object_10 object_2
- Preconditions: sneeze object_4; texture object_8; texture object_10; stupendous object_2; next object_4 object_8; collect object_8 object_2; collect object_10 object_2.
- Effects applied: delete (next object_4 object_8); add (next object_4 object_10).
- State change summary: object_4's "next" target changes from object_8 to object_10.

Step 11 — time 10.0s → 11.0s
Action: tightfisted object_11 object_4 object_10
- Preconditions: hand object_11; sneeze object_4; texture object_10; next object_4 object_10; vase object_11 object_4.
- Effects applied: delete (vase object_11 object_4); add (next object_11 object_10).
- State change summary: the vase (object_11,object_4) is removed; object_11 now points to object_10.

Final relevant fact (after step 11):
- next object_11 object_10 (present)

Goal check:
- The specified goal (next object_11 object_10) is achieved at time 11.0s (immediately after Step 11).

Notes:
- Each step strictly follows the plan's action sequence and parameters.
- Preconditions listed are the ground facts required by the domain for each action and were present when the action executed.
- Each action is shown as taking 1.0s for readability; timestamps are cumulative and illustrative.
