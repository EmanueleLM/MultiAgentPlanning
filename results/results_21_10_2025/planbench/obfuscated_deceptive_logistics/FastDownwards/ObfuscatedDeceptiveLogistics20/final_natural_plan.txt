Timeline of executed actions (each action duration: 1.0s)

Step 0 — t = 0.0s → 1.0s
Action: wretched (variant a) by analyst_A
Parameters: sneeze = object_4, from = object_10, to = object_11, stupendous = object_3
What happens: Replace next(object_4, object_10) with next(object_4, object_11).
Effects applied: remove (next object_4 object_10); add (next object_4 object_11).

Step 1 — t = 1.0s → 2.0s
Action: wretched (variant a) by analyst_A
Parameters: sneeze = object_4, from = object_7, to = object_10, stupendous = object_2
What happens: Replace next(object_4, object_7) with next(object_4, object_10).
Effects applied: remove (next object_4 object_7); add (next object_4 object_10).

Step 2 — t = 2.0s → 3.0s
Action: clip (variant a) by analyst_A
Parameters: hand = object_12, sneeze = object_4, texture = object_10
What happens: Using hand object_12 and sneeze object_4 at texture object_10, create a vase relationship and remove the hand’s next link to object_10.
Effects applied: remove (next object_12 object_10); add (vase object_12 object_4).

Step 3 — t = 3.0s → 4.0s
Action: tightfisted (variant a) by analyst_A
Parameters: hand = object_12, sneeze = object_4, texture = object_11
What happens: With vase(object_12,object_4) and next(object_4,object_11) present, remove the vase and give object_12 a next link to object_11.
Effects applied: remove (vase object_12 object_4); add (next object_12 object_11).
Note: This establishes (next object_12 object_11), one of the final goals.

Step 4 — t = 4.0s → 5.0s
Action: memory (variant a) by analyst_A
Parameters: cats = object_1, from = object_9, to = object_8
What happens: Move the cat’s next link from object_9 to object_8.
Effects applied: remove (next object_1 object_9); add (next object_1 object_8).

Step 5 — t = 5.0s → 6.0s
Action: sip (variant a) by analyst_A
Parameters: hand = object_11, cats = object_1, texture = object_8
What happens: With next(object_11,object_8) and next(object_1,object_8) present, create vase(object_11,object_1) and remove next(object_11,object_8).
Effects applied: remove (next object_11 object_8); add (vase object_11 object_1).

Step 6 — t = 6.0s → 7.0s
Action: memory (variant a) by analyst_A
Parameters: cats = object_1, from = object_8, to = object_9
What happens: Move the cat’s next link back from object_8 to object_9.
Effects applied: remove (next object_1 object_8); add (next object_1 object_9).

Step 7 — t = 7.0s → 8.0s
Action: paltry (variant a) by analyst_A
Parameters: hand = object_11, cats = object_1, texture = object_9
What happens: With vase(object_11,object_1) and next(object_1,object_9) present, remove the vase and give object_11 a next link to object_9.
Effects applied: remove (vase object_11 object_1); add (next object_11 object_9).
Note: This establishes (next object_11 object_9), the other final goal.

Final state relevant facts (achieved)
- (next object_12 object_11) — set in Step 3
- (next object_11 object_9)  — set in Step 7

Both declared goals (next object_11 object_9) and (next object_12 object_11) are achieved after Step 7.
