Summary of scheduling rules used below:
- Actions are executed sequentially in the exact order of the provided plan.
- Each action has unit duration (1 time unit). Start times are integers t = 0..23; an action at t=k finishes at t=k+1.
- For each step I list: timestamp, action with concrete arguments, required preconditions (per the domain), and effects (what is added and what is deleted). Preconditions/effects are quoted using the predicates from the domain (hand, cats, texture, vase, next, collect, sneeze, spring, stupendous).
- Initial facts used are the Variant A facts from the provided problem file.

Plan (24 steps, unit-cost actions). After step 23 the goal (next object_12 object_6, next object_13 object_10, next object_14 object_11) is achieved.

Final verification (after t=24):
- Added/maintained final goal facts:
  (next object_12 object_6) — produced at Step 23
  (next object_13 object_10) — produced at Step 18
  (next object_14 object_11) — produced at Step 20
- Therefore the goal (next object_12 object_6) ∧ (next object_13 object_10) ∧ (next object_14 object_11) is satisfied.

Notes on durations and timestamps:
- Each step used a unit duration; start times are shown above. This preserves the original plan order and unit cost = 24 reported in the plan.

If you want, I can:
- produce a concise trace of the evolving key predicates (next and vase) after each step,
- or emphasize conflicts where actions delete facts needed by later steps and show how the plan circumvents them.
