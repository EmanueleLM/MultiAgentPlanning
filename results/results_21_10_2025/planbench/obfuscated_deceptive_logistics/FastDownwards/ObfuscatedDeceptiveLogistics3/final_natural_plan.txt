Planned execution (steps follow the provided plan exactly). Each step shows: action, parameters, start/end timestamp (1 time unit per action), required preconditions that are satisfied at that moment, and the direct effects produced.

Timestamps use simple integer time units starting at t=0.

Step 1 — t=0 → t=1
- Action: sip object_8 object_0 object_6
- Parameters: h=object_8, c=object_0, t=object_6
- Preconditions (checked at t=0): hand(object_8), cats(object_0), texture(object_6), next(object_8,object_6), next(object_0,object_6)
- Effects applied at t=1: add vase(object_8,object_0); remove next(object_8,object_6)

Step 2 — t=1 → t=2
- Action: sip object_7 object_0 object_6
- Parameters: h=object_7, c=object_0, t=object_6
- Preconditions (checked at t=1): hand(object_7), cats(object_0), texture(object_6), next(object_7,object_6), next(object_0,object_6)
- Effects applied at t=2: add vase(object_7,object_0); remove next(object_7,object_6)

Step 3 — t=2 → t=3
- Action: memory object_0 object_6 object_5
- Parameters: c=object_0, from=object_6, to=object_5
- Preconditions (checked at t=2): cats(object_0), spring(object_6), spring(object_5), next(object_0,object_6)
- Effects applied at t=3: add next(object_0,object_5); remove next(object_0,object_6)

Step 4 — t=3 → t=4
- Action: paltry object_8 object_0 object_5
- Parameters: h=object_8, c=object_0, t=object_5
- Preconditions (checked at t=3): hand(object_8), cats(object_0), texture(object_5), vase(object_8,object_0), next(object_0,object_5)
- Effects applied at t=4: add next(object_8,object_5); remove vase(object_8,object_0)

Step 5 — t=4 → t=5
- Action: paltry object_7 object_0 object_5
- Parameters: h=object_7, c=object_0, t=object_5
- Preconditions (checked at t=4): hand(object_7), cats(object_0), texture(object_5), vase(object_7,object_0), next(object_0,object_5)
- Effects applied at t=5: add next(object_7,object_5); remove vase(object_7,object_0)

Outcome at t=5:
- Goal satisfied: next(object_7,object_5) and next(object_8,object_5) are both true.
- Total steps: 5. Total time: 5 time units.
