Summary: follow the given plan of four actions exactly. I list each step (action name and its parameters), an assumed timestamp and duration (1 time unit each), the preconditions that must hold when the action is applied (and that they do hold given the provided initial facts and prior steps), and the direct effects produced. After the four steps I confirm the goal conditions are satisfied.

Step 1 — time 0.0 → 1.0 (duration 1.0)
Action: memory object_1 object_6 object_7
What it does (plain): move the "next" link for object_1 from object_6 to object_7.
Required preconditions (checked): 
- (cats object_1) — present in initial facts.
- (spring object_6) and (spring object_7) — both present in initial facts.
- (next object_1 object_6) — present in initial facts.
Effects applied:
- Add (next object_1 object_7).
- Remove (next object_1 object_6).

State after step 1 (relevant facts):
- (next object_1 object_7) is true.
- (next object_1 object_6) is false (removed).
- All other initial facts unchanged.

Step 2 — time 1.0 → 2.0 (duration 1.0)
Action: sip object_9 object_1 object_7
What it does (plain): create a vase relation between object_9 and object_1, removing the next link from object_9 to object_7.
Required preconditions (checked):
- (hand object_9) — present in initial facts.
- (cats object_1) — present in initial facts.
- (texture object_7) — present in initial facts.
- (next object_0 object_2) pattern not relevant here; relevant required ones:
- (next object_9 object_7) — present in initial facts.
- (next object_1 object_7) — made true by Step 1.
Effects applied:
- Add (vase object_9 object_1).
- Remove (next object_9 object_7).

State after step 2 (relevant facts):
- (vase object_9 object_1) is true.
- (next object_9 object_7) is false (removed).
- (next object_1 object_7) remains true until next step changes it.

Step 3 — time 2.0 → 3.0 (duration 1.0)
Action: memory object_1 object_7 object_6
What it does (plain): move the "next" link for object_1 from object_7 back to object_6.
Required preconditions (checked):
- (cats object_1) — present initially.
- (spring object_7) and (spring object_6) — both present initially.
- (next object_1 object_7) — true after Step 1 and still true after Step 2.
Effects applied:
- Add (next object_1 object_6).
- Remove (next object_1 object_7).

State after step 3 (relevant facts):
- (next object_1 object_6) is true again.
- (next object_1 object_7) is false (removed).
- (vase object_9 object_1) from Step 2 remains true.

Step 4 — time 3.0 → 4.0 (duration 1.0)
Action: paltry object_9 object_1 object_6
What it does (plain): create a "next" relation from object_9 to object_6 (and remove the vase linking object_9 and object_1).
Required preconditions (checked):
- (hand object_9) — present initially.
- (cats object_1) — present initially.
- (texture object_6) — present initially.
- (vase object_9 object_1) — created by Step 2 and still present.
- (next object_1 object_6) — created by Step 3.
Effects applied:
- Add (next object_9 object_6).
- Remove (vase object_9 object_1).

State after step 4 (final relevant facts):
- (next object_9 object_6) is true (newly added).
- (next object_8 object_7) was true in the initial state and was never changed, so it remains true.
- The intermediate vase (vase object_9 object_1) was removed by Step 4.

Goal check (final):
Requested goal: (next object_8 object_7) and (next object_9 object_6).
- (next object_8 object_7): true in initial state and unchanged → satisfied.
- (next object_9 object_6): established by Step 4 → satisfied.

Conclusion: Executing, in order, the four actions exactly as given:
1) memory object_1 object_6 object_7
2) sip object_9 object_1 object_7
3) memory object_1 object_7 object_6
4) paltry object_9 object_1 object_6
(with each action taking an assumed 1.0 time unit at timestamps 0–1, 1–2, 2–3, 3–4) results in both goal facts being true. All action preconditions are met at the time each action is applied under the provided initial facts and the effects of prior actions.
