Step 1 — t = 0s to 1s
- Action: player1 performs agent1-clip(object_9, object_4, object_7)
- Preconditions required (checked against the initial facts):
  - hand object_9 (true)
  - sneeze object_4 (true)
  - texture object_7 (true)
  - next object_4 object_7 (true)
  - next object_9 object_7 (true)
- Effects (applied immediately):
  - Add: vase object_9 object_4
  - Delete: next object_9 object_7

Step 2 — t = 1s to 2s
- Action: player2 performs agent2-wretched(object_4, object_7, object_8, object_2)
- Preconditions required (after Step 1):
  - sneeze object_4 (true)
  - texture object_7 (true)
  - texture object_8 (true)
  - stupendous object_2 (true)
  - next object_4 object_7 (still true after Step 1)
  - collect object_7 object_2 (true)
  - collect object_8 object_2 (true)
- Effects (applied immediately):
  - Add: next object_4 object_8
  - Delete: next object_4 object_7

Step 3 — t = 2s to 3s
- Action: player1 performs agent1-tightfisted(object_9, object_4, object_8)
- Preconditions required (after Steps 1–2):
  - hand object_9 (true)
  - sneeze object_4 (true)
  - texture object_8 (true)
  - next object_4 object_8 (created by Step 2)
  - vase object_9 object_4 (created by Step 1)
- Effects (applied immediately):
  - Add: next object_9 object_8
  - Delete: vase object_9 object_4

Outcome
- The final goal next object_9 object_8 is achieved after Step 3.
- Plan length: 3 actions (unit cost per action); total reported duration ≈ 3s in this schedule.
