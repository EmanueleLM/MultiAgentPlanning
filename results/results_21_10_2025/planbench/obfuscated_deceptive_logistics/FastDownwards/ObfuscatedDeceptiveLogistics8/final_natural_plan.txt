Summary: the given plan contains three actions. Each action is executed in order, each taking 1 time unit (plan cost = 3 unit-cost actions). I list each step with a timestamp, the required preconditions, the effects, which initial/following facts satisfy the preconditions, and the resulting changes. At the end I confirm the goal is achieved.

Step 1 — time 0..1:
- Action: clip object_9 object_4 object_8
- Preconditions required:
  - hand(object_9)
  - sneeze(object_4)
  - texture(object_8)
  - next(object_4, object_8)
  - next(object_9, object_8)
- Which facts satisfy them at time 0:
  - hand(object_9) — given in init
  - sneeze(object_4) — given in init
  - texture(object_8) — given in init
  - next(object_4, object_8) — given in init
  - next(object_9, object_8) — given in init
- Effects when applied:
  - add vase(object_9, object_4)
  - delete next(object_9, object_8)
- Resulting state changes after Step 1:
  - vase(object_9, object_4) becomes true
  - next(object_9, object_8) becomes false
- Applicability: applicable (all preconditions present at time 0).

Step 2 — time 1..2:
- Action: wretched object_4 object_8 object_7 object_2
- Preconditions required:
  - sneeze(object_4)
  - texture(object_8)
  - texture(object_7)
  - stupendous(object_2)
  - next(object_4, object_8)
  - collect(object_8, object_2)
  - collect(object_7, object_2)
- Which facts satisfy them at time 1 (after Step 1):
  - sneeze(object_4) — given in init
  - texture(object_8) — given in init
  - texture(object_7) — given in init
  - stupendous(object_2) — given in init
  - next(object_4, object_8) — still true (Step 1 did not delete next(object_4,object_8))
  - collect(object_8, object_2) — given in init
  - collect(object_7, object_2) — given in init
- Effects when applied:
  - add next(object_4, object_7)
  - delete next(object_4, object_8)
- Resulting state changes after Step 2:
  - next(object_4, object_7) becomes true
  - next(object_4, object_8) becomes false
- Applicability: applicable (all preconditions present at time 1).

Step 3 — time 2..3:
- Action: tightfisted object_9 object_4 object_7
- Preconditions required:
  - hand(object_9)
  - sneeze(object_4)
  - texture(object_7)
  - next(object_4, object_7)
  - vase(object_9, object_4)
- Which facts satisfy them at time 2 (after Step 2):
  - hand(object_9) — given in init (unchanged)
  - sneeze(object_4) — given in init (unchanged)
  - texture(object_7) — given in init (unchanged)
  - next(object_4, object_7) — added by Step 2
  - vase(object_9, object_4) — added by Step 1
- Effects when applied:
  - add next(object_9, object_7)
  - delete vase(object_9, object_4)
- Resulting state changes after Step 3:
  - next(object_9, object_7) becomes true
  - vase(object_9, object_4) becomes false
- Applicability: applicable (all preconditions present at time 2).

Final state relevant to the goal (after time 3):
- next(object_10, object_5) — remained true from the initial state (never deleted)
- next(object_9, object_7) — added by Step 3

Goal check:
- Goal required: next object_10 object_5 AND next object_9 object_7
- Both are true in the final state, so the plan achieves the goal.
- Total plan cost/duration: 3 unit steps (each step 1 time unit), matching the provided cost = 3.
