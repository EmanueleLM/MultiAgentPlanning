Overview: Execute the given plan exactly (5 actions). Each step shows a timestamp (start — end), the action with its object arguments, the preconditions checked at that moment, and the effects (facts added and removed). After the last step I confirm the goal is satisfied. Total plan cost: 5 (total duration shown as 5.0s, 1.0s per action).

Step 1 — t=0.0s → 1.0s
Action: clip object_9 object_3 object_5
- Preconditions verified at start:
  - hand(object_9)
  - sneeze(object_3)
  - texture(object_5)
  - next(object_3, object_5)
  - next(object_9, object_5)
- Effects (applied at completion):
  - Added: vase(object_9, object_3)
  - Removed: next(object_9, object_5)
- Notes: This converts the connection (next object_9 → object_5) into a vase relation between object_9 and object_3 while leaving next(object_3,object_5) intact.

Step 2 — t=1.0s → 2.0s
Action: clip object_10 object_3 object_5
- Preconditions verified at start:
  - hand(object_10)
  - sneeze(object_3)
  - texture(object_5)
  - next(object_3, object_5)  (still true)
  - next(object_10, object_5)
- Effects (applied at completion):
  - Added: vase(object_10, object_3)
  - Removed: next(object_10, object_5)
- Notes: Similar to step 1 but for object_10; next(object_3,object_5) remains until later actions.

Step 3 — t=2.0s → 3.0s
Action: wretched object_3 object_5 object_6 object_1
- Preconditions verified at start:
  - sneeze(object_3)
  - texture(object_5)
  - texture(object_6)
  - stupendous(object_1)
  - next(object_3, object_5)  (still present until this step)
  - collect(object_5, object_1)
  - collect(object_6, object_1)
- Effects (applied at completion):
  - Added: next(object_3, object_6)
  - Removed: next(object_3, object_5)
- Notes: This moves the “next” pointer from object_5 to object_6 for object_3.

Step 4 — t=3.0s → 4.0s
Action: tightfisted object_9 object_3 object_6
- Preconditions verified at start:
  - hand(object_9)
  - sneeze(object_3)
  - texture(object_6)
  - next(object_3, object_6)  (added in step 3)
  - vase(object_9, object_3)  (added in step 1)
- Effects (applied at completion):
  - Added: next(object_9, object_6)
  - Removed: vase(object_9, object_3)
- Notes: object_9 gains next→object_6; the intermediate vase(object_9,object_3) is consumed/removed.

Step 5 — t=4.0s → 5.0s
Action: tightfisted object_10 object_3 object_6
- Preconditions verified at start:
  - hand(object_10)
  - sneeze(object_3)
  - texture(object_6)
  - next(object_3, object_6)  (still present)
  - vase(object_10, object_3)  (added in step 2)
- Effects (applied at completion):
  - Added: next(object_10, object_6)
  - Removed: vase(object_10, object_3)
- Notes: object_10 gains next→object_6; vase(object_10,object_3) is removed.

Final state relevant facts (summary):
- next(object_9, object_6) — present (added step 4)
- next(object_10, object_6) — present (added step 5)
- next(object_3, object_6) — present (added step 3)
- next(object_9, object_5) — removed (step 1)
- next(object_10, object_5) — removed (step 2)
- next(object_3, object_5) — removed (step 3)
- vase(object_9, object_3) — added then removed (steps 1 and 4)
- vase(object_10, object_3) — added then removed (steps 2 and 5)

Goal satisfaction:
- The required goals (next object_10 object_6) and (next object_9 object_6) are both true after step 5. Plan completed successfully. Total reported duration: 5.0s; cost = 5.
