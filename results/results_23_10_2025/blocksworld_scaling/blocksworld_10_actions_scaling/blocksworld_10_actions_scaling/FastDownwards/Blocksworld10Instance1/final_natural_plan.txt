1) Time 0.0 → 1.0 — Action: (pickup-alpha-a-step1)  
   Agent: agent_alpha  
   Operation: pickup(A) — picked up block A from the table.  
   Immediate result: A is being held by agent_alpha; A is no longer on the table; hand is not empty.

2) Time 1.0 → 2.0 — Action: (putdown-alpha-a-step2)  
   Agent: agent_alpha  
   Operation: putdown(A) — placed block A back onto the table.  
   Immediate result: A is on the table and clear; hand is empty.

3) Time 2.0 → 3.0 — Action: (unstack-alpha-b-from-e-step3)  
   Agent: agent_alpha  
   Operation: unstack(B, E) — removed block B from on top of E (picked up B).  
   Immediate result: B is being held by agent_alpha; E became clear.

4) Time 3.0 → 4.0 — Action: (stack-alpha-b-onto-e-step4)  
   Agent: agent_alpha  
   Operation: stack(B, E) — placed B back onto E.  
   Immediate result: B is on E; B is clear; hand is empty; E is no longer clear.

5) Time 4.0 → 5.0 — Action: (unstack-alpha-b-from-e-step5)  
   Agent: agent_alpha  
   Operation: unstack(B, E) — removed B again from on top of E (picked up B).  
   Immediate result: B is being held by agent_alpha; E became clear.

6) Time 5.0 → 6.0 — Action: (putdown-beta-b-step6)  
   Agent: agent_beta  
   Operation: putdown(B) — placed block B onto the table.  
   Immediate result: B is on the table and clear; hand is empty.

7) Time 6.0 → 7.0 — Action: (pickup-beta-a-step7)  
   Agent: agent_beta  
   Operation: pickup(A) — picked up block A from the table.  
   Immediate result: A is being held by agent_beta; A is no longer on the table; hand is not empty.

8) Time 7.0 → 8.0 — Action: (putdown-beta-a-step8)  
   Agent: agent_beta  
   Operation: putdown(A) — placed block A back onto the table.  
   Immediate result: A is on the table and clear; hand is empty.

9) Time 8.0 → 9.0 — Action: (unstack-beta-e-from-f-step9)  
   Agent: agent_beta  
   Operation: unstack(E, F) — removed block E from on top of F (picked up E).  
   Immediate result: E is being held by agent_beta; F became clear.

10) Time 9.0 → 10.0 — Action: (putdown-beta-e-step10)  
    Agent: agent_beta  
    Operation: putdown(E) — placed block E onto the table.  
    Immediate result: E is on the table and clear; hand is empty; step10 reached.

Final state (after step10) — for each block, whether it is on the table or on another block:
- A: on the table  
- B: on the table  
- C: on the table (D is on C)  
- D: on C  
- E: on the table  
- F: on G  
- G: on the table

Global fluent results: handempty = true, step10 = true.
