Summary: Executing the given plan exactly as provided (4 actions). Timestamps and short durations are included for each step. After the four actions the final arrangement matches the specified goal.

Initial state (before step 1)
- ontable: A, D, E
- on: B on G; C on D; F on A; G on E
- clear: B, C, F
- handempty: true

Step 1 — (unstack B G)
- Timestamp: 2025-10-21T00:00:00Z
- Duration: 1s (estimated)
- Action: unstack(B, G)
- Preconditions checked: B is on G, B is clear, hand is empty → legal.
- Effects / state change:
  - Now holding(B).
  - G becomes clear.
  - (B on G) is removed.
  - B is no longer clear.
  - handempty becomes false.

State after step 1
- holding: B
- on: C on D; F on A; G on E (B is not on G anymore)
- clear: C, F, G
- handempty: false
- ontable: A, D, E

Step 2 — (putdown B)
- Timestamp: 2025-10-21T00:00:01Z
- Duration: 1s (estimated)
- Action: putdown(B)
- Preconditions checked: holding(B) → legal.
- Effects / state change:
  - B is placed on the table: ontable(B).
  - B becomes clear.
  - hand becomes empty (handempty = true).
  - no longer holding(B).

State after step 2
- ontable: A, B, D, E
- on: C on D; F on A; G on E
- clear: B, C, F, G
- holding: none
- handempty: true

Step 3 — (unstack C D)
- Timestamp: 2025-10-21T00:00:02Z
- Duration: 1s (estimated)
- Action: unstack(C, D)
- Preconditions checked: C is on D, C is clear, hand is empty → legal.
- Effects / state change:
  - Now holding(C).
  - D becomes clear.
  - (C on D) is removed.
  - C is no longer clear.
  - handempty becomes false.

State after step 3
- holding: C
- ontable: A, B, D, E
- on: F on A; G on E
- clear: B, F, G, D
- handempty: false

Step 4 — (putdown C)
- Timestamp: 2025-10-21T00:00:03Z
- Duration: 1s (estimated)
- Action: putdown(C)
- Preconditions checked: holding(C) → legal.
- Effects / state change:
  - C is placed on the table: ontable(C).
  - C becomes clear.
  - hand becomes empty (handempty = true).
  - no longer holding(C).

Final state (after step 4)
- ontable: A, B, C, D, E
- on: F on A; G on E
- clear: B, C, F, G, D
- holding: none
- handempty: true

Goal verification
- Required final ontable: A, D, E, C, B — all present.
- Required final on relationships: F on A; G on E — present.
- Therefore the final state satisfies the PDDL goal.

Notes
- All actions in the provided plan were legal under standard Blocks World rules at the time they were performed.
- No additional actions were added or removed; the sequence strictly follows the given plan.
