Plan of actions (each action takes 1 time unit). Timestamps use t0..t10; step i executes from ti-1 to ti.

1) t0 → t1 (unstack by agent_a)
   Action: unstack(agent_a, G, H)
   Immediate effects observed:
   - G is no longer on H.
   - agent_a is holding G.
   - H becomes clear.
   (relations: not on(G,H); holding(agent_a,G); clear(H))

2) t1 → t2 (putdown by agent_a)
   Action: putdown(agent_a, G, table0)
   Immediate effects observed:
   - G is placed on the table.
   - agent_a is no longer holding G (handempty).
   - G is clear.
   (relations: ontable(G); handempty(agent_a); clear(G))

3) t2 → t3 (pickup by agent_a)
   Action: pickup(agent_a, H, table0)
   Immediate effects observed:
   - H is removed from the table.
   - agent_a is holding H (not handempty).
   - H is not clear while held.
   (relations: not ontable(H); holding(agent_a,H))

4) t3 → t4 (stack by agent_a)
   Action: stack(agent_a, H, G)
   Immediate effects observed:
   - H is placed on G.
   - agent_a is no longer holding H (handempty).
   - H is clear; G is no longer clear.
   (relations: on(H,G); handempty(agent_a); clear(H); not clear(G))

5) t4 → t5 (unstack by agent_b)
   Action: unstack(agent_b, H, G)
   Immediate effects observed:
   - H is removed from G.
   - agent_b is holding H (not handempty).
   - G becomes clear.
   (relations: not on(H,G); holding(agent_b,H); clear(G))

6) t5 → t6 (putdown by agent_b)
   Action: putdown(agent_b, H, table0)
   Immediate effects observed:
   - H is placed on the table.
   - agent_b is no longer holding H (handempty).
   - H is clear.
   (relations: ontable(H); handempty(agent_b); clear(H))

7) t6 → t7 (pickup by agent_b)
   Action: pickup(agent_b, G, table0)
   Immediate effects observed:
   - G is removed from the table.
   - agent_b is holding G (not handempty).
   (relations: not ontable(G); holding(agent_b,G))

8) t7 → t8 (stack by agent_b)
   Action: stack(agent_b, G, E)
   Immediate effects observed:
   - G is placed on E.
   - agent_b is no longer holding G (handempty).
   - G is clear; E is no longer clear.
   (relations: on(G,E); handempty(agent_b); clear(G); not clear(E))

9) t8 → t9 (pickup by agent_b)
   Action: pickup(agent_b, H, table0)
   Immediate effects observed:
   - H is removed from the table.
   - agent_b is holding H (not handempty).
   (relations: not ontable(H); holding(agent_b,H))

10) t9 → t10 (stack by agent_b)
    Action: stack(agent_b, H, G)
    Immediate effects observed:
    - H is placed on G.
    - agent_b is no longer holding H (handempty).
    - H is clear; G is no longer clear.
    (relations: on(H,G); handempty(agent_b); clear(H); not clear(G))

Final arrangement after t10 (goal satisfied):
- on(A, B)
- on(D, A)
- on(C, D)
- on(F, C)
- on(E, F)
- on(G, E)
- on(H, G)
- ontable(B)

(Each step matches the provided plan exactly and reports the immediate state changes observed for the blocks involved.)
