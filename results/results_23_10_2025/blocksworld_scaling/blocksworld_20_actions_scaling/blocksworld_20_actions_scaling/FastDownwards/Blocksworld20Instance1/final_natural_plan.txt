Initial state (for reference)
- C on A, A on G, G on D, D on table.
- B on F, F on H, H on E, E on table.
- Clear: C, B. Hand: empty.

Execution log (timestamps are illustrative; each action duration ≈ 5–10s)

1) [00:00:00] Action: unstack C from A
   - Description: Pick up block C from atop block A.
   - Resulting changes:
     - C: picked up (holding C)
     - A: becomes clear
   - State of affected blocks after action: C = in hand; A = clear

2) [00:00:10] Action: putdown C
   - Description: Put the held block C down onto the table.
   - Resulting changes:
     - C: on table (ontable C), clear
     - Hand: empty
   - State of affected blocks after action: C = on table

3) [00:00:20] Action: unstack A from G
   - Description: Pick up block A from atop block G.
   - Resulting changes:
     - A: picked up (holding A)
     - G: becomes clear
   - State of affected blocks after action: A = in hand; G = clear

4) [00:00:30] Action: stack A onto B
   - Description: Place the held block A onto block B.
   - Resulting changes:
     - A: on B
     - B: no longer clear
     - Hand: empty
   - State of affected blocks after action: A = on B; B = has A on it

5) [00:00:40] Action: pickup C
   - Description: Pick up block C from the table.
   - Resulting changes:
     - C: picked up (holding C)
     - C: no longer on table or clear while held
   - State of affected blocks after action: C = in hand

6) [00:00:50] Action: stack C onto A
   - Description: Place the held block C onto block A.
   - Resulting changes:
     - C: on A
     - A: no longer clear
     - Hand: empty
   - State of affected blocks after action: C = on A; A = has C on it

7) [00:01:00] Action: unstack G from D
   - Description: Pick up block G from atop block D.
   - Resulting changes:
     - G: picked up (holding G)
     - D: becomes clear (but remains on table)
   - State of affected blocks after action: G = in hand; D = clear, on table

8) [00:01:10] Action: stack G onto C
   - Description: Place the held block G onto block C.
   - Resulting changes:
     - G: on C
     - C: no longer clear
     - Hand: empty
   - State of affected blocks after action: G = on C; C = has G on it

Final arrangement (after step 8)
- G on C
- C on A
- A on B
- B on F
- F on H
- H on E
- E on table
- D on table

This sequence exactly follows the given plan and achieves the required final goal.
