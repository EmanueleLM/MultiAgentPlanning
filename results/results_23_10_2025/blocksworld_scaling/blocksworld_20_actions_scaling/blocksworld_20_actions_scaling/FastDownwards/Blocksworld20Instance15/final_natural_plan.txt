Human-readable execution of the given plan (actions exactly as in the plan, in order).

Overall timing: start t=0. Each action is executed sequentially with duration 1 time unit. Total cost/duration = 4.

Step 1 — t=0 → t=1
Action: unstack D C
Description: Remove block D from on top of block C (take D off C).
Preconditions (satisfied at t=0): on(D, C); clear(D); handempty.
Effects: D is now held (holding D); C becomes clear; D is no longer on C; arm is not empty.
State note after step: holding(D).

Step 2 — t=1 → t=2
Action: putdown D
Description: Put the held block D down onto the table.
Preconditions (satisfied at t=1): holding(D).
Effects: ontable(D); clear(D); handempty; no longer holding(D).
State note after step: D is on the table and the arm is free.

Step 3 — t=2 → t=3
Action: pickup F
Description: Pick up block F from the table.
Preconditions (satisfied at t=2): ontable(F); clear(F); handempty.
Effects: no longer ontable(F); not clear(F); not handempty; holding(F).
State note after step: holding(F).

Step 4 — t=3 → t=4
Action: stack F B
Description: Place the held block F on top of block B.
Preconditions (satisfied at t=3): holding(F); clear(B).
Effects: on(F, B); clear(F); not clear(B); handempty; not holding(F).
State note after step: F is stacked on B and the arm is free.

Final arrangement after executing all steps (matches the PDDL goal):
- on(A, E)
- on(E, G)
- on(H, A)
- on(B, H)
- on(F, B)
- ontable(C)
- ontable(D)
- ontable(G)

Plan cost: 4 (4 actions, 1 time unit each).
