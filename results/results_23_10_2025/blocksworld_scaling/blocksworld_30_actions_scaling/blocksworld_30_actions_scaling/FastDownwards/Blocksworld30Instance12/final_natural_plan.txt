Plan (human-readable trace). Start time 00:00:00. Each action duration: 00:00:10.

1) 00:00:00 → 00:00:10 — (unstack b j)
   - Action: Unstack B from J (worker lifts B).
   - Effects (local): B is now being held; J becomes clear (J remains on the table).
   - Local stack change: J (on table) — previously had B on it; now J is empty/top.

2) 00:00:10 → 00:00:20 — (stack b e)
   - Action: Stack B onto E (place the held B on top of E).
   - Effects (local): B is on E and is clear (B is now the top of that stack); E is no longer clear.
   - Local stack change: A (on table) → E → B (B top).

3) 00:00:20 → 00:00:30 — (unstack h i)
   - Action: Unstack H from I (worker lifts H).
   - Effects (local): H is now being held; I becomes clear (I still on table).
   - Local stack change: G (on table) → I — H removed, so I is temporarily clear.

4) 00:00:30 → 00:00:40 — (putdown h)
   - Action: Put down H onto the table.
   - Effects (local): H is now on the table and clear; hand becomes empty.
   - Local stack change: new stack: H (on table). I remains on the table and clear.

5) 00:00:40 → 00:00:50 — (unstack i g)
   - Action: Unstack I from G (worker lifts I).
   - Effects (local): I is now being held; G becomes clear (G still on table).
   - Local stack change: G (on table) — I removed, G is clear.

6) 00:00:50 → 00:01:00 — (putdown i)
   - Action: Put down I onto the table.
   - Effects (local): I is now on the table and clear; hand becomes empty.
   - Local stack change: new stack: I (on table). G remains on the table and clear.

7) 00:01:00 → 00:01:10 — (pickup g)
   - Action: Pickup G from the table (worker picks up G).
   - Effects (local): G is now being held; its table position is vacated (G not on table while held).
   - Local stack change: G removed from table (hand holding G).

8) 00:01:10 → 00:01:20 — (stack g b)
   - Action: Stack G onto B (place the held G on top of B).
   - Effects (local): G is now on B and clear; B is no longer clear.
   - Local stack change: A (on table) → E → B → G (G top).

9) 00:01:20 → 00:01:30 — (pickup h)
   - Action: Pickup H from the table (worker picks up H).
   - Effects (local): H is now being held; its table position is vacated.
   - Local stack change: H removed from its table position (hand holding H).

10) 00:01:30 → 00:01:40 — (stack h i)
    - Action: Stack H onto I (place the held H on top of I).
    - Effects (local): H is now on I and clear; I is no longer clear.
    - Local stack change: I (on table) → H (H top).

Final arrangement (after all steps):
- Stack 1: A (on table) → E → B → G  (G is top)
- Stack 2: C (on table) → F → D     (D is top)
- Stack 3: I (on table) → H         (H is top)
- Standalone: J (on table)
- Standalone: (none else)

This final arrangement matches the required goal:
- A on table, E on A, B on E, G on B;
- C on table, F on C, D on F;
- I on table, H on I;
- J on table.
