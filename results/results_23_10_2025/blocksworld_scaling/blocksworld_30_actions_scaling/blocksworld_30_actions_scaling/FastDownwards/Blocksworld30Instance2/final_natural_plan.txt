Initial state (t=00:00:00):
- Stacks (topmost shown last): 
  - B (table) <- E <- J <- A (A is top of this stack)
  - C (table) <- D <- H <- I <- F <- G (G is top of this stack)
- Clear: A, G
- Hand: empty

Step 1 — t=00:00:01 — unstack(g, f)
- Action: pick up G from on top of F.
- Preconditions checked: on(g,f)=true, clear(g)=true, handempty=true → OK.
- Effects: G is now held; (on g f) removed; F becomes clear; hand is not empty.
- Resulting local change: top of F removed (G lifted).

Step 2 — t=00:00:02 — putdown(g)
- Action: put G down on the table.
- Preconditions checked: holding(g)=true → OK.
- Effects: ontable(g)=true; clear(g)=true; handempty=true; not holding g.
- Resulting local change: G is now a separate block on the table.

Step 3 — t=00:00:03 — unstack(a, j)
- Action: pick up A from on top of J.
- Preconditions checked: on(a,j)=true, clear(a)=true, handempty=true → OK.
- Effects: holding(a)=true; (on a j) removed; J becomes clear; hand not empty.
- Resulting local change: A lifted from the J stack.

Step 4 — t=00:00:04 — putdown(a)
- Action: put A down on the table.
- Preconditions checked: holding(a)=true → OK.
- Effects: ontable(a)=true; clear(a)=true; handempty=true; not holding a.
- Resulting local change: A is now on the table as its own stack.

Step 5 — t=00:00:05 — unstack(j, e)
- Action: pick up J from on top of E.
- Preconditions checked: on(j,e)=true, clear(j)=true, handempty=true → OK.
- Effects: holding(j)=true; (on j e) removed; E becomes clear; hand not empty.
- Resulting local change: J lifted from the E stack.

Step 6 — t=00:00:06 — putdown(j)
- Action: put J down on the table.
- Preconditions checked: holding(j)=true → OK.
- Effects: ontable(j)=true; clear(j)=true; handempty=true; not holding j.
- Resulting local change: J is now on the table as its own stack.

Step 7 — t=00:00:07 — unstack(e, b)
- Action: pick up E from on top of B.
- Preconditions checked: on(e,b)=true, clear(e)=true, handempty=true → OK.
- Effects: holding(e)=true; (on e b) removed; B becomes clear; hand not empty.
- Resulting local change: E lifted from the B stack.

Step 8 — t=00:00:08 — stack(e, f)
- Action: place the held E onto F.
- Preconditions checked: holding(e)=true, clear(f)=true → OK (F became clear after G was unstacked in Step 1).
- Effects: on(e,f)=true; clear(e)=true; handempty=true; not holding e; clear(f)=false.
- Resulting local change: E is now stacked on F.

Step 9 — t=00:00:09 — pickup(b)
- Action: pick up B from the table.
- Preconditions checked: ontable(b)=true, clear(b)=true, handempty=true → OK (B was cleared in Step 7).
- Effects: holding(b)=true; not ontable(b); not clear(b); hand not empty.
- Resulting local change: B is held.

Step 10 — t=00:00:10 — stack(b, j)
- Action: place the held B onto J.
- Preconditions checked: holding(b)=true, clear(j)=true → OK (J was put down and is clear).
- Effects: on(b,j)=true; clear(b)=true; handempty=true; not holding b; clear(j)=false.
- Resulting local change: B is now stacked on J (B on J).

Step 11 — t=00:00:11 — pickup(a)
- Action: pick up A from the table.
- Preconditions checked: ontable(a)=true, clear(a)=true, handempty=true → OK.
- Effects: holding(a)=true; not ontable(a); not clear(a); hand not empty.
- Resulting local change: A is held.

Step 12 — t=00:00:12 — stack(a, e)
- Action: place the held A onto E.
- Preconditions checked: holding(a)=true, clear(e)=true → OK (E was stacked on F and left clear).
- Effects: on(a,e)=true; clear(a)=true; handempty=true; not holding a; clear(e)=false.
- Resulting local change: A is now stacked on E.

Final observed configuration (direct on / ontable relations):
- on(a,e)
- on(b,j)
- on(d,c)    (unchanged from the start)
- on(e,f)
- on(f,i)    (unchanged from the start)
- on(h,d)    (unchanged from the start)
- on(i,h)    (unchanged from the start)
- ontable(c)
- ontable(g)
- ontable(j)

Verification: The final relations above match the stated goal; all plan steps were executable (preconditions held at each step) and the final goal is achieved.
