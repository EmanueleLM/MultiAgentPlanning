Below is a human-readable, step-by-step rendering of the provided plan. Each step matches one action from the plan exactly. I assume each action takes 1 time unit and show timestamps accordingly.

Step 1 — t = 0s → 1s
- Action: Unstack E from C.
- Effect: Robot picks up E (holding E). C becomes clear. E is no longer on C.

Step 2 — t = 1s → 2s
- Action: Put down E.
- Effect: E is placed on the table (ontable(E)). Robot is handempty. E is clear.

Step 3 — t = 2s → 3s
- Action: Unstack C from G.
- Effect: Robot picks up C (holding C). G becomes clear. C is no longer on G.

Step 4 — t = 3s → 4s
- Action: Put down C.
- Effect: C is placed on the table (ontable(C)). Robot is handempty. C is clear.

Step 5 — t = 4s → 5s
- Action: Unstack H from A.
- Effect: Robot picks up H (holding H). A becomes clear. H is no longer on A.

Step 6 — t = 5s → 6s
- Action: Stack H on D.
- Effect: H is placed on D (on(H,D)). Robot is handempty. D is no longer clear; H is clear.

Step 7 — t = 6s → 7s
- Action: Pickup A.
- Effect: Robot picks up A from the table (holding A). A is no longer on the table.

Step 8 — t = 7s → 8s
- Action: Stack A on E.
- Effect: A is placed on E (on(A,E)). Robot is handempty. E is no longer clear; A is clear.

Step 9 — t = 8s → 9s
- Action: Unstack H from D.
- Effect: Robot picks up H (holding H). D becomes clear. H is no longer on D.

Step 10 — t = 9s → 10s
- Action: Put down H.
- Effect: H is placed on the table (ontable(H)). Robot is handempty. H is clear.

Step 11 — t = 10s → 11s
- Action: Unstack D from I.
- Effect: Robot picks up D (holding D). I becomes clear. D is no longer on I.

Step 12 — t = 11s → 12s
- Action: Stack D on G.
- Effect: D is placed on G (on(D,G)). Robot is handempty. G is no longer clear; D is clear.

Step 13 — t = 12s → 13s
- Action: Unstack I from F.
- Effect: Robot picks up I (holding I). F becomes clear. I is no longer on F.

Step 14 — t = 13s → 14s
- Action: Put down I.
- Effect: I is placed on the table (ontable(I)). Robot is handempty. I is clear (until something is stacked on it).

Step 15 — t = 14s → 15s
- Action: Pickup F.
- Effect: Robot picks up F from the table (holding F). F is no longer on the table.

Step 16 — t = 15s → 16s
- Action: Stack F on I.
- Effect: F is placed on I (on(F,I)). Robot is handempty. I is no longer clear; F is clear.

Step 17 — t = 16s → 17s
- Action: Pickup H.
- Effect: Robot picks up H from the table (holding H). H is no longer on the table.

Step 18 — t = 17s → 18s
- Action: Stack H on D.
- Effect: H is placed on D (on(H,D)). Robot is handempty. D is no longer clear; H is clear.

Final factual snapshot after executing all steps (states expressed as facts):
- on(A, E)
- on(D, G)
- on(H, D)
- on(F, I)
- on(G, B)

- ontable(B)
- ontable(C)
- ontable(E)
- ontable(I)

- clear blocks: A, H, F, C

Total plan cost: 18 (unit cost per action). Total duration (assuming 1 time unit per action): 18 time units (t = 0s → 18s).
