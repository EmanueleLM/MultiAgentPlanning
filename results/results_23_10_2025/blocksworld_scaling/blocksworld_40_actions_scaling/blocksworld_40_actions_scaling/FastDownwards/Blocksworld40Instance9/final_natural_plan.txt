Plan (human-readable trace matching the given PDDL plan). Start time T=00:00:00. Each action duration shown as approx. 5s (incremental timestamps).

1) 00:00:00 — 00:00:05 — unstack F from D
   - Action: remove the top block F from on(D).
   - Observation: robot picks up F (holding F). D becomes clear. F is no longer on D; hand is not empty.

2) 00:00:05 — 00:00:10 — putdown F
   - Action: put F down on the table.
   - Observation: F is on the table and clear. Robot is handempty.

3) 00:00:10 — 00:00:15 — unstack D from E
   - Action: remove D (which was on E).
   - Observation: robot picks up D (holding D). E becomes clear. D is no longer on E; hand is not empty.

4) 00:00:15 — 00:00:20 — putdown D
   - Action: put D down on the table.
   - Observation: D is on the table and clear. Robot is handempty.

5) 00:00:20 — 00:00:25 — pickup E
   - Action: pick up E from the table.
   - Observation: robot picks up E (holding E). E is no longer on the table; hand is not empty. E was clear and remains manipulable.

6) 00:00:25 — 00:00:30 — stack E on G
   - Action: place E on top of G.
   - Observation: E is now on G. E becomes clear; G is no longer clear. Robot is handempty.

7) 00:00:30 — 00:00:35 — pickup D
   - Action: pick up D from the table.
   - Observation: robot picks up D (holding D). D is no longer on the table; hand is not empty.

8) 00:00:35 — 00:00:40 — stack D on E
   - Action: place D on top of E.
   - Observation: D is now on E. D becomes clear; E is no longer clear. Robot is handempty.

Final arrangement (after executing the above actions):
- A is on the table.
- B is on A.
- H is on B.
- I is on the table.
- C is on I.
- G is on C.
- E is on G.
- D is on E.
- F is on the table.

This final arrangement matches the intended goal encoded in the PDDL problem.
