Below is a step-by-step, human-readable trace that follows the plan exactly. Each step shows the plan action (as in the PDDL plan), a short natural-language description, an assigned timestamp and duration (uniform small increment for readability), and the immediate state effects produced by that action.

Timestamps: start 00:00:00, each step +00:00:05.

16) 00:01:15 → 00:01:20 — (stack F B)
    - Action: Stack F onto B (place the held F on top of B).
    - Immediate effects: F is on B; F becomes clear; B is no longer clear; robot's hand becomes empty.

17) 00:01:20 → 00:01:25 — (unstack D H)
    - Action: Unstack D from H (pick D up from on top of H).
    - Immediate effects: Holding D; H becomes clear; D is no longer on H; robot's hand is not empty.

18) 00:01:25 → 00:01:30 — (putdown D)
    - Action: Put D down on the table.
    - Immediate effects: D is on the table (ontable D); D is clear; robot's hand becomes empty.

19) 00:01:30 → 00:01:35 — (pickup H)
    - Action: Pickup H from the table (pick H up).
    - Immediate effects: Holding H; H is no longer on the table; H is not clear; robot's hand is not empty.

20) 00:01:35 → 00:01:40 — (stack H J)

    - Action: Stack D onto H (place the held D on top of H).
    - Immediate effects: D is on H; D becomes clear; H is no longer clear; robot's hand becomes empty.

23) 00:01:50 → 00:01:55 — (verify-final-arrangement)
    - Action: Verify the final arrangement (check the exact required configuration).
    - Immediate effect: The problem is marked verified (goal achieved) since the required final relations hold.

Final arrangement (as required by the verify-final-arrangement preconditions)
- Blocks on the table (ontable): L, B, C, E, G, M (these are table bases).
- Stacks / on relations:
  - A is on L
  - K is on A
  - F is on B
  - J is on C
  - H is on J
  - D is on H
  - I is on G

Verification result: The verify-final-arrangement action succeeds because the above final relations are present; the plan reached the goal (verified).

Notes:
- The sequence above exactly mirrors the PDDL plan actions in order; no actions were added or removed.
- Each listed immediate effect corresponds to the standard Blocks World semantics for pickup, putdown, unstack, and stack.
