Below is a step-by-step, human-readable execution of the given plan. Each step matches exactly one action from the plan, shows an estimated duration and timestamps (start/end), states the minimal precondition assumed for that action, and the direct effect on the blocks.

Timeline starts at t = 0.0 s.

1) t=0.0 → 4.0 s (duration 4.0 s)
Action: unstack(A, F)
- Precondition assumed: A is on F, A is clear (nothing on A), and the manipulator's hand is empty.
- Effect/result: The manipulator lifts A off F and is holding A. F becomes clear.

2) t=4.0 → 6.0 s (duration 2.0 s)
Action: putdown(A)
- Precondition assumed: The manipulator is holding A.
- Effect/result: A is placed down on the table (A is ontable and clear). The manipulator's hand becomes empty.

3) t=6.0 → 10.0 s (duration 4.0 s)
Action: unstack(F, H)
- Precondition assumed: F is on H, F is clear, and the manipulator's hand is empty.
- Effect/result: The manipulator lifts F off H and is holding F. H becomes clear.

4) t=10.0 → 13.0 s (duration 3.0 s)
Action: stack(F, A)
- Precondition assumed: The manipulator is holding F and A is clear.
- Effect/result: F is placed on top of A (on F A). The manipulator's hand becomes empty. F is clear (nothing on F until later).

5) t=13.0 → 17.0 s (duration 4.0 s)
Action: unstack(H, B)
- Precondition assumed: H is on B, H is clear, and the manipulator's hand is empty.
- Effect/result: The manipulator lifts H off B and is holding H. B becomes clear.

6) t=17.0 → 19.0 s (duration 2.0 s)
Action: putdown(H)
- Precondition assumed: The manipulator is holding H.
- Effect/result: H is placed on the table (H is ontable and clear). The manipulator's hand becomes empty.

7) t=19.0 → 23.0 s (duration 4.0 s)
Action: unstack(B, C)
- Precondition assumed: B is on C, B is clear, and the manipulator's hand is empty.
- Effect/result: The manipulator lifts B off C and is holding B. C becomes clear.

8) t=23.0 → 26.0 s (duration 3.0 s)
Action: stack(B, F)
- Precondition assumed: The manipulator is holding B and F is clear.
- Effect/result: B is placed on top of F (on B F). The manipulator's hand becomes empty.

9) t=26.0 → 30.0 s (duration 4.0 s)
Action: unstack(C, E)
- Precondition assumed: C is on E, C is clear, and the manipulator's hand is empty.
- Effect/result: The manipulator lifts C off E and is holding C. E becomes clear.

10) t=30.0 → 33.0 s (duration 3.0 s)
Action: stack(C, H)
- Precondition assumed: The manipulator is holding C and H is clear (H was put down earlier).
- Effect/result: C is placed on top of H (on C H). The manipulator's hand becomes empty.

Final arrangement after step 10 (matches the specified goal):
- A is on the table.
- F is on A.
- B is on F.
- H is on the table.
- C is on H.
- D is on the table.
- G is on D.
- E is on G.
- I is on the table.
- J is on I.

Total plan duration (estimated): 33.0 s.

Notes:
- Durations are estimated/representative to give timestamps; they do not alter the sequence or the effects.
- Preconditions listed are the minimal ones required by the standard Blocks World operators (unstack/pickup/stack/putdown).
