Below is a human-readable, step-by-step execution of the provided plan. Each step corresponds exactly to one action in the plan (same order, same moves). I give an estimated timestamp and a per-move duration (30 s each) so you can track timing; total estimated time = 8:00.

1. [t = 00:00:00, dur 00:00:30] move-disk-to-empty a b left → middle
   - Move disk A (currently on top of B on the left peg) from the left peg to the middle peg (middle peg is empty).

2. [t = 00:00:30, dur 00:00:30] move-disk-to-empty b c left → right
   - Move disk B (currently on top of C on the left peg) from the left peg to the right peg (right peg is empty).

3. [t = 00:01:00, dur 00:00:30] move-peg-to-disk a middle → right on B
   - Move disk A (top of middle peg) from the middle peg to the right peg, placing it onto disk B.

4. [t = 00:01:30, dur 00:00:30] move-disk-to-empty c d left → middle
   - Move disk C (currently on top of D on the left peg) from the left peg to the middle peg (middle peg is empty after step 3).

5. [t = 00:02:00, dur 00:00:30] move-disk-to-disk a b right → left on D
   - Move disk A (top of right peg, on B) from the right peg to the left peg, placing it onto disk D.

6. [t = 00:02:30, dur 00:00:30] move-peg-to-disk b right → middle on C
   - Move disk B (top of right peg) from the right peg to the middle peg, placing it onto disk C.

7. [t = 00:03:00, dur 00:00:30] move-disk-to-disk a d left → middle on B
   - Move disk A (top of left peg, on D) from the left peg to the middle peg, placing it onto disk B.

8. [t = 00:03:30, dur 00:00:30] move-peg-to-empty d left → right
   - Move disk D (currently on the left peg and is the bottom disk there) from the left peg to the right peg (right peg becomes non-empty).

9. [t = 00:04:00, dur 00:00:30] move-disk-to-disk a b middle → right on D
   - Move disk A (top of middle peg, on B) from the middle peg to the right peg, placing it onto disk D.

10. [t = 00:04:30, dur 00:00:30] move-disk-to-empty b c middle → left
    - Move disk B (top of middle peg, on C) from the middle peg to the left peg (left peg is empty after D moved).

11. [t = 00:05:00, dur 00:00:30] move-disk-to-disk a d right → left on B
    - Move disk A (top of right peg, on D) from the right peg to the left peg, placing it onto disk B.

12. [t = 00:05:30, dur 00:00:30] move-peg-to-disk c middle → right on D
    - Move disk C (top of middle peg) from the middle peg to the right peg, placing it onto disk D.

13. [t = 00:06:00, dur 00:00:30] move-disk-to-disk a b left → right on C
    - Move disk A (top of left peg, on B) from the left peg to the right peg, placing it onto disk C.

14. [t = 00:06:30, dur 00:00:30] move-disk-to-empty a c right → middle
    - Move disk A (top of right peg, on C) from the right peg to the middle peg (middle peg becomes non-empty).

15. [t = 00:07:00, dur 00:00:30] move-peg-to-disk b left → right on C
    - Move disk B (top of left peg) from the left peg to the right peg, placing it onto disk C.

16. [t = 00:07:30, dur 00:00:30] move-peg-to-disk a middle → right on B
    - Move disk A (top of middle peg) from the middle peg to the right peg, placing it onto disk B.

End state (after t = 00:08:00): right peg has disks top→bottom A, B, C, D; left and middle pegs are empty — goal achieved.

(Each step above corresponds exactly to the plan lines provided and respects the Hanoi constraints: single-disk moves and never placing a larger disk on a smaller one.)
