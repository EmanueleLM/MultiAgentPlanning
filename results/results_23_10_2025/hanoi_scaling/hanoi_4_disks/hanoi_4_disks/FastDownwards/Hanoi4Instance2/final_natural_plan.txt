Step 1 — t = 0s → 1s (dur 1s):
Move disk A from left peg (A was on top of disk B) to middle peg (middle is empty).

Step 2 — t = 1s → 2s (dur 1s):
Move disk B from left peg (B was on top of disk C) to right peg (right is empty).

Step 3 — t = 2s → 3s (dur 1s):
Move disk A from middle peg (A was on the peg) onto disk B on right peg.

Step 4 — t = 3s → 4s (dur 1s):
Move disk C from left peg (C was on top of disk D) to middle peg (middle is empty).

Step 5 — t = 4s → 5s (dur 1s):
Move disk A from right peg (A was on top of disk B) to left peg, placing A on top of disk D.

Step 6 — t = 5s → 6s (dur 1s):
Move disk B from right peg (B is now top) onto disk C on middle peg.

Step 7 — t = 6s → 7s (dur 1s):
Move disk A from left peg (A was on top of disk D) onto disk B on middle peg.

Step 8 — t = 7s → 8s (dur 1s):
Move disk D from left peg (D was top of left) to right peg (right is empty).

Step 9 — t = 8s → 9s (dur 1s):
Move disk A from middle peg (A was on top of B) onto disk D on right peg.

Step 10 — t = 9s → 10s (dur 1s):
Move disk B from middle peg (B was on top of C) to left peg (left is empty).

Step 11 — t = 10s → 11s (dur 1s):
Move disk A from right peg (A was on top of D) onto disk B on left peg.

Step 12 — t = 11s → 12s (dur 1s):
Move disk C from middle peg (C was top of middle) onto disk D on right peg.

Step 13 — t = 12s → 13s (dur 1s):
Move disk A from left peg (A was on top of B) to middle peg (middle is empty).

Step 14 — t = 13s → 14s (dur 1s):
Move disk B from left peg (B was top of left) onto disk C on right peg.

Step 15 — t = 14s → 15s (dur 1s):
Move disk A from middle peg (A was top of middle) onto disk B on right peg.

Result (t = 15s):
Goal achieved — right peg stack top→bottom: A, B, C, D. Left peg empty. Middle peg empty.
