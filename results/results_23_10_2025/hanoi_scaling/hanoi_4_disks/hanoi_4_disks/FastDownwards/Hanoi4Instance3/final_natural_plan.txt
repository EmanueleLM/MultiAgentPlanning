Assume each move takes 1.0s. Timestamps are cumulative from t=0.0s.

1) t=0.0s → 1.0s: Move disk A from on top of disk B (left peg) to the top of the middle peg.  
2) t=1.0s → 2.0s: Move disk B from on top of disk C (left peg) to the top of the right peg.  
3) t=2.0s → 3.0s: Move disk A from the middle peg onto disk B (which is on the right peg).  
4) t=3.0s → 4.0s: Move disk C from on top of disk D (left peg) to the top of the middle peg.  
5) t=4.0s → 5.0s: Move disk A from on top of disk B (right peg) onto disk D (left peg).  
6) t=5.0s → 6.0s: Move disk B from the right peg onto disk C (middle peg).  
7) t=6.0s → 7.0s: Move disk A from on top of disk D (left peg) onto disk B (middle peg).  
8) t=7.0s → 8.0s: Move disk D from the left peg to the top of the right peg.  
9) t=8.0s → 9.0s: Move disk A from on top of disk B (middle peg) onto disk D (right peg).  
10) t=9.0s → 10.0s: Move disk B from on top of disk C (middle peg) to the top of the left peg.  
11) t=10.0s → 11.0s: Move disk A from on top of disk D (right peg) onto disk B (left peg).  
12) t=11.0s → 12.0s: Move disk C from the middle peg onto disk D (right peg).  
13) t=12.0s → 13.0s: Move disk A from on top of disk B (left peg) to the top of the middle peg.  
14) t=13.0s → 14.0s: Move disk B from on top of disk C (right peg) onto disk C (right peg)? — (interpretation: move B from the left peg onto disk C located on the right peg).  
    Clarification: This step moves disk B (currently on the left peg) onto disk C (which is on the right peg).
15) t=14.0s → 15.0s: Move disk A from the middle peg onto disk B (now on the right peg).

Final state at t=15.0s (goal reached): right peg holds top→bottom A, B, C, D; middle peg empty; left peg empty.
