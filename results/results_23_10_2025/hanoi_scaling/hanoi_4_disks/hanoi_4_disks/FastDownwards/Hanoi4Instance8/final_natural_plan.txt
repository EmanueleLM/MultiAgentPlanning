Plan summary: 15 unit steps (each step duration = 1 time unit). Start time t = 0. Disk sizes: A (smallest), B, C, D (largest). Initial: left = [A, B, C, D] (top->bottom), middle = [], right = []. Goal: right = [A, B, C, D] (top->bottom), left = [], middle = [].

Step 1 — t=0..1 (move-to-peg a b middle)
- Action: Move disk A from on top of disk B to the middle peg.
- Resulting state: left = [B, C, D], middle = [A], right = []

Step 2 — t=1..2 (move-to-peg b c right)
- Action: Move disk B from on top of disk C to the right peg.
- Resulting state: left = [C, D], middle = [A], right = [B]

Step 3 — t=2..3 (move-to-disk a middle b)
- Action: Move disk A from the middle peg and place it on top of disk B (on the right peg).
- Resulting state: left = [C, D], middle = [], right = [A, B]

Step 4 — t=3..4 (move-to-peg c d middle)
- Action: Move disk C from on top of disk D to the middle peg.
- Resulting state: left = [D], middle = [C], right = [A, B]

Step 5 — t=4..5 (move-to-disk a b d)
- Action: Move disk A from on top of disk B (right) and place it on top of disk D (on the left peg).
- Resulting state: left = [A, D], middle = [C], right = [B]

Step 6 — t=5..6 (move-to-disk b right c)
- Action: Move disk B from the right peg and place it on top of disk C (on the middle peg).
- Resulting state: left = [A, D], middle = [B, C], right = []

Step 7 — t=6..7 (move-to-disk a d b)
- Action: Move disk A from on top of disk D (left) and place it on top of disk B (middle).
- Resulting state: left = [D], middle = [A, B, C], right = []

Step 8 — t=7..8 (move-to-peg d left right)
- Action: Move disk D from the left peg to the right peg.
- Resulting state: left = [], middle = [A, B, C], right = [D]

Step 9 — t=8..9 (move-to-disk a b d)
- Action: Move disk A from on top of disk B (middle) and place it on top of disk D (right).
- Resulting state: left = [], middle = [B, C], right = [A, D]

Step 10 — t=9..10 (move-to-peg b c left)
- Action: Move disk B from on top of disk C (middle) to the left peg.
- Resulting state: left = [B], middle = [C], right = [A, D]

Step 11 — t=10..11 (move-to-disk a d b)
- Action: Move disk A from on top of disk D (right) and place it on top of disk B (left).
- Resulting state: left = [A, B], middle = [C], right = [D]

Step 12 — t=11..12 (move-to-disk c middle d)
- Action: Move disk C from the middle peg and place it on top of disk D (right).
- Resulting state: left = [A, B], middle = [], right = [C, D]

Step 13 — t=12..13 (move-to-peg a b middle)
- Action: Move disk A from on top of disk B (left) to the middle peg.
- Resulting state: left = [B], middle = [A], right = [C, D]

Step 14 — t=13..14 (move-to-disk b left c)
- Action: Move disk B from the left peg and place it on top of disk C (right).
- Resulting state: left = [], middle = [A], right = [B, C, D]

Step 15 — t=14..15 (move-to-disk a middle b)
- Action: Move disk A from the middle peg and place it on top of disk B (right).
- Resulting state (goal achieved): left = [], middle = [], right = [A, B, C, D]

Total cost: 15 unit steps. Final configuration matches the goal: right peg has A (top), B, C, D (bottom).
