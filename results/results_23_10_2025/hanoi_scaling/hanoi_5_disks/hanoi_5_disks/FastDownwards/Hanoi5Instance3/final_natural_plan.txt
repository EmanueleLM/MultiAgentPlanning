Plan (32 steps). Each step lists a timestamp (starting at 00:00:00) and a clear description of the move. Disk labels: A (smallest) through E (largest). Pegs: left, middle, right. Each move moves exactly one top disk and never places a larger disk on a smaller one.

1. [00:00:00] Move disk A from on top of disk B to the right peg.
2. [00:00:10] Move disk B from on top of disk C to the middle peg.
3. [00:00:20] Move disk A from the right peg onto disk B.
4. [00:00:30] Move disk C from on top of disk D to the right peg.
5. [00:00:40] Move disk A from on top of disk B onto disk D.
6. [00:00:50] Move disk B from the middle peg onto disk C.
7. [00:01:00] Move disk A from on top of disk D onto disk B.
8. [00:01:10] Move disk D from on top of disk E to the middle peg.
9. [00:01:20] Move disk A from on top of disk B onto disk E.
10. [00:01:30] Move disk A from on top of disk E onto disk D.
11. [00:01:40] Move disk B from on top of disk C onto disk E.
12. [00:01:50] Move disk A from on top of disk D onto disk B.
13. [00:02:00] Move disk C from the right peg onto disk D.
14. [00:02:10] Move disk A from on top of disk B to the right peg.
15. [00:02:20] Move disk B from on top of disk E onto disk C.
16. [00:02:30] Move disk A from the right peg onto disk B.
17. [00:02:40] Move disk E from the left peg to the right peg.
18. [00:02:50] Move disk A from on top of disk B to the left peg.
19. [00:03:00] Move disk B from on top of disk C onto disk E.
20. [00:03:10] Move disk A from the left peg onto disk B.
21. [00:03:20] Move disk C from on top of disk D to the left peg.
22. [00:03:30] Move disk A from on top of disk B onto disk D.
23. [00:03:40] Move disk B from on top of disk E onto disk C.
24. [00:03:50] Move disk A from on top of disk D onto disk B.
25. [00:04:00] Move disk D from on top of disk (supporting) middle peg onto disk E.  (i.e., place D onto E on the right-side stack)
26. [00:04:10] Move disk A from on top of disk B onto disk D.
27. [00:04:20] Move disk B from on top of disk C to the middle peg.
28. [00:04:30] Move disk A from on top of disk D onto disk B.
29. [00:04:40] Move disk C from the left peg onto disk D.
30. [00:04:50] Move disk A from on top of disk B to the left peg.
31. [00:05:00] Move disk B from the middle peg onto disk C.
32. [00:05:10] Move disk A from the left peg onto disk B.

Result: After these 32 moves, the right peg contains the stack top->bottom A, B, C, D, E, and the left and middle pegs are empty — goal achieved.
