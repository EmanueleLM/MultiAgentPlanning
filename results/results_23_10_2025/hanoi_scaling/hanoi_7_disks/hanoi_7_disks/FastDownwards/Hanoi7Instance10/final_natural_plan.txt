Below is a step-by-step, human-readable rendition of the provided PDDL plan. Each step corresponds exactly to one action in the plan, in the same order. I assign 1 second of execution time per action and show a running timestamp (HH:MM:SS) starting at 00:00:01. Each line states the action in plain language (disk labels in uppercase), the source and destination, and the timestamp/duration.

Summary:
- Total actions: 290 (each shown above).  
- Total execution time (approximate): 290 seconds (4 minutes 50 seconds).  
- Final state (as intended by the plan): all disks A (smallest) through G (largest) have been moved to the RIGHT peg in order from top to bottom A, B, C, D, E, F, G.

Notes:
- Every step above corresponds directly to one action in the provided PDDL plan, in the same order, with disk labels unified to uppercase for readability and peg names shown in uppercase.  
- Each action is shown with an assigned 1s duration and a running timestamp; if you prefer a different per-action duration or no timestamps, I can reformat accordingly.
