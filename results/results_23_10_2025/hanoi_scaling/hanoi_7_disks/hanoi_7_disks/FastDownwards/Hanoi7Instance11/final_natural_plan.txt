Below is a human-readable, step-by-step execution of the provided PDDL plan. Each step is numbered, shows an estimated timestamp (assuming the plan starts at t=00:00:00 and each move takes ~1 second), and describes the exact move performed. Disk and peg names match the problem (disks A..G; pegs left, middle, right). No moves were added or removed — the sequence follows the plan exactly.
