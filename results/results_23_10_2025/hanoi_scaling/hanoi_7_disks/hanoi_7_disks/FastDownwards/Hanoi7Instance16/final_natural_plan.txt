Summary: 20 moves, one move per step, each step duration 1.0s. Start time t=0.0s. After these moves the goal is reached: the right peg holds (top->bottom) A, B, C, D, E, F, G; left and middle pegs are empty.

1) t=0.0s → 1.0s: Move disk A from left peg (on top of B) to middle peg (middle was empty).  
2) t=1.0s → 2.0s: Move disk B from left peg (on top of C) to right peg (right was empty).  
3) t=2.0s → 3.0s: Move disk A from middle peg to right peg, placing it on top of B.  
4) t=3.0s → 4.0s: Move disk C from left peg (on top of D) to middle peg (middle is empty now).  
5) t=4.0s → 5.0s: Move disk B from right peg to middle peg, placing it on top of C.  
6) t=5.0s → 6.0s: Move disk D from left peg (on top of E) to right peg (right currently has A on B).  
7) t=6.0s → 7.0s: Move disk C from middle peg to right peg, placing it on top of D.  
8) t=7.0s → 8.0s: Move disk E from left peg (on top of F) to middle peg (middle currently has B on C).  
9) t=8.0s → 9.0s: Move disk E from middle peg to left peg, placing it on top of F.  
10) t=9.0s → 10.0s: Move disk F from left peg (on top of G) to middle peg (middle currently has B on C).  
11) t=10.0s → 11.0s: Move disk D from right peg to left peg, placing it on top of E.  
12) t=11.0s → 12.0s: Move disk G from left peg to right peg (right was not empty — G becomes top of the right stack's base).  
13) t=12.0s → 13.0s: Move disk F from middle peg to right peg, placing it on top of G.  
14) t=13.0s → 14.0s: Move disk D from left peg (on top of E) to right peg, placing it on top of F.  
15) t=14.0s → 15.0s: Move disk F from right peg to left peg, placing it on top of G.  
16) t=15.0s → 16.0s: Move disk E from left peg to right peg, placing it on top of F.  
17) t=16.0s → 17.0s: Move disk F from left peg to right peg, placing it on top of G.  
18) t=17.0s → 18.0s: Move disk C from right peg to middle peg (freeing the correct order for smaller disks).  
19) t=18.0s → 19.0s: Move disk B from middle peg to right peg, placing it on top of C (which is currently on the right under G).  
20) t=19.0s → 20.0s: Move disk C from middle peg to right peg, placing it on top of B (finalizing the stack).

Result at t=20.0s: Right peg (top→bottom) = A, B, C, D, E, F, G; left and middle pegs empty. Total cost: 20 moves. All moves respect the rule “never place a larger disk on top of a smaller disk.”
