Below is a human-readable, step-by-step execution of the provided PDDL plan. Each step corresponds exactly to one action in the plan (no actions added or removed). I give a simple timestamp for each step (starting at 00:00:00 and incrementing by 1 second per step) so you can see ordering and approximate duration.
