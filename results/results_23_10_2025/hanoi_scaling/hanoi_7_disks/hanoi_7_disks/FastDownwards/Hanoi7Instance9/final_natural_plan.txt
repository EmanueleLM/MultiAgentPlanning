Step 1 — Action: (move-to-peg A left right)
- Description: Move disk A (the smallest/top disk) from the left peg to the right peg.
- Exact plan action: move-to-peg A left right
- Start time: t = 0s
- Duration / cost: 1 time unit (cost = 1)
- Legality check: Valid — A was the top disk on the left peg and the right peg was empty, so moving the top disk to an empty peg obeys the Tower of Hanoi rules.
- Resulting local states after the action:
  - Left peg (top → bottom): B, C, D, E, F, G
  - Middle peg: (empty)
  - Right peg (top → bottom): A
- Note: This single-step plan executes exactly the provided action. It does not complete the overall instance goal (moving the entire 7-disk stack to the right peg); further legal moves would be required to reach the final goal.
