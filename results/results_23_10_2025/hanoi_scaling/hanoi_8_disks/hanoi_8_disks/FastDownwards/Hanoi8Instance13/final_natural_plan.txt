Below is the plan from the PDDL, converted into a human-readable, step-by-step sequence. Each step corresponds exactly to one action in the given plan and is listed in the same order. For clarity I show the disk (A..H) and whether the source/target is a peg (Left / Middle / Right) or another disk (Disk X). I include a simple timestamp assuming 1 second per move: step k is at t = (k-1) s.

(End of plan — total moves: 287, cost = 287)

Notes:
- Every line maps exactly to the corresponding plan action in the given order. Source/target labels: Left / Middle / Right refer to pegs; Disk X refers to one disk used as the support in the move.
- Timestamps assume one move per second (step k at t = k-1 s) for readability. If you prefer different durations or no timestamps, I can remove or adjust them.
