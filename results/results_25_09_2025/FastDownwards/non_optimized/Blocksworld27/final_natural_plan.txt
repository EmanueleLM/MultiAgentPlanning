Summary of constraints (kept for reference)
- Vowel agent (vowel_agent) may only move vowel blocks: A, E, I.
- Consonant agent (consonant_agent) may only move consonant blocks: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K.
- Agents may move only the top block of a stack and only one block at a time.
- Each action below follows the given plan exactly and is listed in order. Each action is assumed to take 1 time unit. Start time = 0. Total cost = 27 time units.

Final state (goal achieved)
- After step 27 (time 27), the target chain is reached:
  A on B, B on C, C on D, D on E, E on F, F on G, G on H, H on I, I on J, J on K, and K on the table.
- Total plan cost / total duration = 27 time units.
