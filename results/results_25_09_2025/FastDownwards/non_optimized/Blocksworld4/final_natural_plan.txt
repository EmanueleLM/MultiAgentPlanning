Final status (after step 32): The plan completes the specified sequence of moves. Following these steps the stack order matches the provided problem goal: A on B on C on D on E on F on G on H on I on J on K, with K on the table (plan cost = 32 unit steps).

Notes:
- Each action above respects agent capabilities: vowel_agent moves only vowel-labeled blocks (A, E, I) and consonant_agent moves only consonant-labeled blocks.
- Timestamps are estimates in seconds, using 1.0s per action for readability; actual durations may differ in a real execution.
