Summary: The following 34 steps correspond exactly to the provided plan. Each step lists the agent, the action translated to plain English, and a simple timestamp assuming each action takes 1 time unit (step N runs from time N-1.0 to N.0). Agents follow the specification: vowel_agent only moves A, E, I; consonant_agent only moves J K G F B D C H.

Step 1 (t=0.0–1.0)
- consonant_agent unstacked C from D (picked up block C from on top of D).

Step 2 (t=1.0–2.0)
- consonant_agent put down C onto the table (placed block C on the table).

Step 3 (t=2.0–3.0)
- consonant_agent unstacked D from B (picked up block D from on top of B).

Step 4 (t=3.0–4.0)
- consonant_agent put down D onto the table (placed block D on the table).

Step 5 (t=4.0–5.0)
- consonant_agent unstacked B from F (picked up block B from on top of F).

Step 6 (t=5.0–6.0)
- consonant_agent put down B onto the table (placed block B on the table).

Step 7 (t=6.0–7.0)
- consonant_agent unstacked F from A (picked up block F from on top of A).

Step 8 (t=7.0–8.0)
- vowel_agent unstacked A from G (picked up block A from on top of G).

Step 9 (t=8.0–9.0)
- consonant_agent stacked F onto C (placed block F, which the consonant agent was holding, onto block C).

Step 10 (t=9.0–10.0)
- consonant_agent unstacked G from K (picked up block G from on top of K).

Step 11 (t=10.0–11.0)
- consonant_agent stacked G onto D (placed block G, which the consonant agent was holding, onto block D).

Step 12 (t=11.0–12.0)
- consonant_agent unstacked K from J (picked up block K from on top of J).

Step 13 (t=12.0–13.0)
- consonant_agent put down K onto the table (placed block K on the table).

Step 14 (t=13.0–14.0)
- consonant_agent picked up J (picked up block J from the table).

Step 15 (t=14.0–15.0)
- consonant_agent stacked J onto K (placed block J, which the consonant agent was holding, onto block K).

Step 16 (t=15.0–16.0)
- vowel_agent stacked A onto B (placed block A, which the vowel agent was holding, onto block B).

Step 17 (t=16.0–17.0)
- vowel_agent unstacked I from H (picked up block I from on top of H).

Step 18 (t=17.0–18.0)
- consonant_agent unstacked H from E (picked up block H from on top of E).

Step 19 (t=18.0–19.0)
- vowel_agent stacked I onto J (placed block I, which the vowel agent was holding, onto block J).

Step 20 (t=19.0–20.0)
- vowel_agent picked up E (picked up block E from the table).

Step 21 (t=20.0–21.0)
- consonant_agent stacked H onto I (placed block H, which the consonant agent was holding, onto block I).

Step 22 (t=21.0–22.0)
- consonant_agent unstacked G from D (picked up block G from on top of D).

Step 23 (t=22.0–23.0)
- consonant_agent stacked G onto H (placed block G, which the consonant agent was holding, onto block H).

Step 24 (t=23.0–24.0)
- consonant_agent unstacked F from C (picked up block F from on top of C).

Step 25 (t=24.0–25.0)
- consonant_agent stacked F onto G (placed block F, which the consonant agent was holding, onto block G).

Step 26 (t=25.0–26.0)
- consonant_agent picked up D (picked up block D from the table).

Step 27 (t=26.0–27.0)
- vowel_agent stacked E onto F (placed block E, which the vowel agent was holding, onto block F).

Step 28 (t=27.0–28.0)
- consonant_agent stacked D onto E (placed block D, which the consonant agent was holding, onto block E).

Step 29 (t=28.0–29.0)
- consonant_agent picked up C (picked up block C from the table).

Step 30 (t=29.0–30.0)
- consonant_agent stacked C onto D (placed block C, which the consonant agent was holding, onto block D).

Step 31 (t=30.0–31.0)
- vowel_agent unstacked A from B (picked up block A from on top of B).

Step 32 (t=31.0–32.0)
- consonant_agent picked up B (picked up block B from the table).

Step 33 (t=32.0–33.0)
- consonant_agent stacked B onto C (placed block B, which the consonant agent was holding, onto block C).

Step 34 (t=33.0–34.0)
- vowel_agent stacked A onto B (placed block A, which the vowel agent was holding, onto block B).

Final state (after t=34.0)
- The stacked configuration achieved matches the global goal:
  A on B, B on C, C on D, D on E, E on F, F on G, G on H, H on I, I on J, J on K, and K on the table.

Notes:
- Actions are presented in the exact order of the plan; no actions were added or removed.
- Each step respects agent capabilities: vowel_agent moved only A, E, I; consonant_agent moved only J K G F B D C H.
- Timestamping assumed uniform 1.0 time-unit duration per action for readability; if you need different durations or real timestamps, indicate desired units.
