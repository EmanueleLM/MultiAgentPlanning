Summary: the following 17 steps reproduce the provided PDDL plan exactly. Each step lists a timestamp, duration (1 time unit), the agent who acts (vowel_agent or consonant_agent), and a clear natural-language description of the move. All moves respect the agents' constraints (only top blocks, only vowels for vowel_agent, only consonants for consonant_agent).

Schedule (each action duration = 1 time unit)

1) Time 0 → 1 (duration 1)
Agent: consonant_agent
Action: Move B from G to the table.
(Natural reading of: (cons-move-block-to-place b g table))

2) Time 1 → 2 (duration 1)
Agent: consonant_agent
Action: Move G from I to the table.
(Natural reading of: (cons-move-block-to-place g i table))

3) Time 2 → 3 (duration 1)
Agent: vowel_agent
Action: Move I from F onto G.
(Natural reading of: (vowel-move-block-to-block i f g))

4) Time 3 → 4 (duration 1)
Agent: consonant_agent
Action: Move F from E to the table.
(Natural reading of: (cons-move-block-to-place f e table))

5) Time 4 → 5 (duration 1)
Agent: consonant_agent
Action: Move C from A onto B.
(Natural reading of: (cons-move-block-to-block c a b))

6) Time 5 → 6 (duration 1)
Agent: vowel_agent
Action: Move E from J onto C.
(Natural reading of: (vowel-move-block-to-block e j c))

7) Time 6 → 7 (duration 1)
Agent: vowel_agent
Action: Move A from D to the table.
(Natural reading of: (vowel-move-block-to-place a d table))

8) Time 7 → 8 (duration 1)
Agent: consonant_agent
Action: Move D from H onto A.
(Natural reading of: (cons-move-block-to-block d h a))

9) Time 8 → 9 (duration 1)
Agent: vowel_agent
Action: Move I from G onto J.
(Natural reading of: (vowel-move-block-to-block i g j))

10) Time 9 → 10 (duration 1)
Agent: consonant_agent
Action: Move H from the table onto I.
(Natural reading of: (cons-move-place-to-block h table i))

11) Time 10 → 11 (duration 1)
Agent: consonant_agent
Action: Move G from the table onto H.
(Natural reading of: (cons-move-place-to-block g table h))

12) Time 11 → 12 (duration 1)
Agent: consonant_agent
Action: Move F from the table onto G.
(Natural reading of: (cons-move-place-to-block f table g))

13) Time 12 → 13 (duration 1)
Agent: vowel_agent
Action: Move E from C onto F.
(Natural reading of: (vowel-move-block-to-block e c f))

14) Time 13 → 14 (duration 1)
Agent: consonant_agent
Action: Move D from A onto E.
(Natural reading of: (cons-move-block-to-block d a e))

15) Time 14 → 15 (duration 1)
Agent: consonant_agent
Action: Move C from B onto D.
(Natural reading of: (cons-move-block-to-block c b d))

16) Time 15 → 16 (duration 1)
Agent: consonant_agent
Action: Move B from the table onto C.
(Natural reading of: (cons-move-place-to-block b table c))

17) Time 16 → 17 (duration 1)
Agent: vowel_agent
Action: Move A from the table onto B.
(Natural reading of: (vowel-move-place-to-block a table b))

End state (after time 17): single stack (bottom → top): J (on table), I on J, H on I, G on H, F on G, E on F, D on E, C on D, B on C, A on B — which matches the goal. Total cost: 17 unit-cost actions.
