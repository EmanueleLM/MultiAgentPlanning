Step 1 — t = 0.0s → 1.0s (duration 1.0s)
- Action: vowel_agent performs "vowel-pickup A"
- What happened: vowel_agent picks up block A from the table.
- Preconditions satisfied: A was on the table, A was clear (top of its stack), vowel_agent's hand was empty, and A is a vowel (allowed for vowel_agent).
- Effects (state changes):
  - vowel_agent is now holding A.
  - A is no longer on the table and is no longer marked clear.
  - vowel_agent's hand is no longer empty.

Step 2 — t = 1.0s → 2.0s (duration 1.0s)
- Action: consonant_agent performs "cons-pickup B"
- What happened: consonant_agent picks up block B from the table.
- Preconditions satisfied: B was on the table, B was clear, consonant_agent's hand was empty, and B is a consonant (allowed for consonant_agent).
- Effects (state changes):
  - consonant_agent is now holding B.
  - B is no longer on the table and is no longer marked clear.
  - consonant_agent's hand is no longer empty.

Step 3 — t = 2.0s → 3.0s (duration 1.0s)
- Action: consonant_agent performs "cons-stack B C"
- What happened: consonant_agent places B on top of C.
- Preconditions satisfied: consonant_agent was holding B, C was clear, and B is a consonant.
- Effects (state changes):
  - B is now on C.
  - C is no longer clear.
  - B is clear (being the top of that small stack).
  - consonant_agent's hand becomes empty (no longer holding B).

Step 4 — t = 3.0s → 4.0s (duration 1.0s)
- Action: vowel_agent performs "vowel-stack A B"
- What happened: vowel_agent places A on top of B.
- Preconditions satisfied: vowel_agent was holding A, B was clear after Step 3, and A is a vowel.
- Effects (state changes):
  - A is now on B.
  - B is no longer clear.
  - A is clear (top of the tower).
  - vowel_agent's hand becomes empty (no longer holding A).

Final result (after t = 4.0s)
- The relevant part of the final tower is achieved: A on B on C on D on E on F on G on H on I on J, with J on the table.
- All actions respect agent constraints: vowel_agent only manipulated A (a vowel); consonant_agent only manipulated B (and stacked it on C, both consonants). Only top blocks were picked/placed and agents handled one block at a time.
- Total plan cost: 4 actions (unit cost per action).
