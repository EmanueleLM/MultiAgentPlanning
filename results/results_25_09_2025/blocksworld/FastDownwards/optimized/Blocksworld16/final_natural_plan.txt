Below is a human-readable, step-by-step rendering of the given PDDL plan. Each step lists the exact plan action (as in the plan), the agent who performs it (vowel_agent or consonant_agent, per the domain), a short plain-English description of what happens, and a simple timestamp assuming each action takes 1 time unit. The sequence is identical to the plan and contains 32 actions (cost = 32).

t = 0  (vowel-unstack a m)

t = 15 (cons-pickup-from-block h d)
  - Agent: consonant_agent
  - Action: Pick up H from D. consonant_agent now holding H; D becomes clear.

t = 16 (vowel-stack i j)
  - Agent: vowel_agent
  - Action: Stack I onto J (vowel_agent places the I it is holding onto J). vowel_agent releases I; I is now on J; I is clear; J is no longer clear.

t = 17 (vowel-pickup-from-table e)
  - Agent: vowel_agent
  - Action: Pick up E from the table. vowel_agent now holding E; E is no longer on the table.

t = 18 (cons-putdown-on-block h i)
  - Agent: consonant_agent
  - Action: Put H onto I. consonant_agent releases H; H is now on I; H is clear; I is no longer clear.

t = 19 (cons-pickup-from-block g a)
