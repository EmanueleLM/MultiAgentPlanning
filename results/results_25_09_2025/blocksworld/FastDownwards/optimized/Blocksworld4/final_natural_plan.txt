Step 1 — t = 0 → 1 (duration 1, cost = 1)
- Agent: vowel_agent
- Action: Move block A from the table onto block B.
- Rationale / Preconditions (checked): A is a vowel and is on the table and clear; B is clear; A ≠ B — so the action vowel_move-table-to-block a b is allowed.
- Effects (resulting facts): A is no longer on the table and is now on B (on A B); B is no longer clear; A is clear (top).
- Compliance: Only a vowel block (A) was moved by the vowel_agent, and only top blocks were manipulated, matching the specification.
- Goal status after step: The goal stack A on B on C on D on E on F on G on H on I on J (with J on the table) is achieved.
