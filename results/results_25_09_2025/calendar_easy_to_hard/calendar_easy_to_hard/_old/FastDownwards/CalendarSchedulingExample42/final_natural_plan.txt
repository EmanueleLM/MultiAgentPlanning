Step 1 — Andrea schedules the meeting at 14:30 on Monday
- Action executed: schedule_by_andrea(t1430)
- Timestamp / duration: meeting starts 14:30, duration 30 minutes → 14:30–15:00 (time-slot resolution 30 min)
- Preconditions (met): the meeting was not yet scheduled and every participant (Samantha, Brian, Arthur, Matthew, Marilyn, Mark, Andrea) was free at 14:30.
- Effects (result): the meeting is now scheduled at 14:30 on Monday; all participants (Samantha, Brian, Arthur, Matthew, Marilyn, Mark, Andrea) are marked as attending; the 14:30 slot is no longer free for those participants; the global "meeting-not-scheduled" flag is cleared.
- Goal status after this step: achieved — a single 30-minute Monday meeting (14:30–15:00) is scheduled with all listed participants attending.
