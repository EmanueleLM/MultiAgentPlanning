PROBLEM
------------------------------
You are an expert at scheduling meetings. You are given a few constraints on the existing schedule of each participant, the meeting duration, and possibly some preferences on the meeting time. Note there exists a solution that works with existing schedule of every participant. Here are a few example tasks and solutions:

TASK: You need to schedule a meeting for Michelle, Steven and Jerry for one hour between the work hours of 9:00 to 17:00 on Monday. 

Here are the existing schedules for everyone during the day: 
Michelle has meetings on Monday during 11:00 to 12:00; 
Steven has blocked their calendar on Monday during 9:00 to 9:30, 11:30 to 12:00, 13:30 to 14:00, 15:30 to 16:00; 
Jerry has blocked their calendar on Monday during 9:00 to 9:30, 10:00 to 11:00, 11:30 to 12:30, 13:00 to 14:30, 15:30 to 16:00, 16:30 to 17:00; 

Find a time that works for everyone's schedule and constraints.

NATURAL-PLAN sas_plan_5
------------------------------
Mapping of half-slot indices to times (Monday, 30-minute half-slots):
- slot0 = 09:00–09:30
- slot1 = 09:30–10:00
- slot2 = 10:00–10:30
- slot3 = 10:30–11:00
- slot4 = 11:00–11:30
- slot5 = 11:30–12:00
- slot6 = 12:00–12:30
- slot7 = 12:30–13:00
- slot8 = 13:00–13:30
- slot9 = 13:30–14:00
- slot10 = 14:00–14:30
- slot11 = 14:30–15:00
- slot12 = 15:00–15:30
- slot13 = 15:30–16:00
- slot14 = 16:00–16:30
- slot15 = 16:30–17:00

Planned actions (in the order of the given PDDL plan):

1) schedule_jerry slot11 slot12
- Actor: Jerry
- Action: Jerry indicates he is available for a meeting starting at slot11 and spanning the next half-slot (slot11 → slot12).
- Time implied: Monday 14:30–15:30 (one hour total: slot11 14:30–15:00 plus slot12 15:00–15:30)
- Effect: Jerry marks that a one-hour meeting starting at 14:30 is acceptable for him.

2) schedule_michelle slot11 slot12
- Actor: Michelle
- Action: Michelle indicates she is available for a meeting starting at slot11 and spanning slot12.
- Time implied: Monday 14:30–15:30 (one hour)
- Effect: Michelle marks that a one-hour meeting starting at 14:30 is acceptable for her.

3) schedule_steven slot11 slot12
- Actor: Steven
- Action: Steven indicates he is available for a meeting starting at slot11 and spanning slot12.
- Time implied: Monday 14:30–15:30 (one hour)
- Effect: Steven marks that a one-hour meeting starting at 14:30 is acceptable for him.

4) confirm_meeting slot11 slot12
- Actor: Orchestrator (finalizing)
- Action: Confirm the meeting that was proposed by all participants for slot11→slot12.
- Time confirmed: Monday 14:30–15:30 (one hour)
- Effect: The meeting is created and slots slot11 and slot12 are occupied; Michelle, Steven, and Jerry are booked for that hour.

Final outcome: A one-hour meeting on Monday from 14:30 to 15:30 is agreed and confirmed for Michelle, Steven, and Jerry; both half-slots (slot11 and slot12) are now occupied for that meeting.

PROBLEM
------------------------------
You are an expert at scheduling meetings. You are given a few constraints on the existing schedule of each participant, the meeting duration, and possibly some preferences on the meeting time. Note there exists a solution that works with existing schedule of every participant. Here are a few example tasks and solutions:

TASK: You need to schedule a meeting for Raymond, Billy and Donald for half an hour between the work hours of 9:00 to 17:00 on Monday. 

Here are the existing schedules for everyone during the day: 
Raymond has blocked their calendar on Monday during 9:00 to 9:30, 11:30 to 12:00, 13:00 to 13:30, 15:00 to 15:30; 
Billy has meetings on Monday during 10:00 to 10:30, 12:00 to 13:00, 16:30 to 17:00; 
Donald has meetings on Monday during 9:00 to 9:30, 10:00 to 11:00, 12:00 to 13:00, 14:00 to 14:30, 16:00 to 17:00; 

Billy would like to avoid more meetings on Monday after 15:00. Find a time that works for everyone's schedule and constraints.
