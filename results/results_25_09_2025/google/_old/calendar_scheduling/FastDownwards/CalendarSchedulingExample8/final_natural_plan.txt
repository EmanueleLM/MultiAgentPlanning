Step 1 — schedule-by-agent2 (execute scheduling)
- Action: schedule-by-agent2 m1 @ s1100 for participants Adam, Jerry, Matthew.
- What happens (semantics): the 30-minute meeting m1 is scheduled in slot s1100 (i.e., Monday 11:00–11:30).
- Preconditions satisfied (so the action was valid): m1 is a meeting, s1100 is a valid free slot, Adam, Jerry and Matthew are listed as meeting participants and were all free at s1100 (none were busy at that slot).
- Effects applied:
  - The slot is now marked as scheduled: meeting_scheduled(s1100).
  - The slot is no longer free: slot-free(s1100) is removed.
  - Each participant’s free status for that slot is removed: Adam, Jerry and Matthew are no longer free at s1100.
- Outcome: A 30-minute meeting on Monday from 11:00 to 11:30 with Adam, Jerry and Matthew is successfully scheduled, satisfying the global goal.
