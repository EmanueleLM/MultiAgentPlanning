PROBLEM
------------------------------
You are an expert at scheduling meetings. You are given a few constraints on the existing schedule of each participant, the meeting duration, and possibly some preferences on the meeting time. Note there exists a solution that works with existing schedule of every participant. Here are a few example tasks and solutions:

TASK: You need to schedule a meeting for Michelle, Steven and Jerry for one hour between the work hours of 9:00 to 17:00 on Monday. 

Here are the existing schedules for everyone during the day: 
Michelle has meetings on Monday during 11:00 to 12:00; 
Steven has blocked their calendar on Monday during 9:00 to 9:30, 11:30 to 12:00, 13:30 to 14:00, 15:30 to 16:00; 
Jerry has blocked their calendar on Monday during 9:00 to 9:30, 10:00 to 11:00, 11:30 to 12:30, 13:00 to 14:30, 15:30 to 16:00, 16:30 to 17:00; 

Find a time that works for everyone's schedule and constraints.

NATURAL-PLAN sas_plan_1
------------------------------
Step 1 — Execute action from the plan:
- PDDL action: (schedule-meeting m1 t1430 t1500 jerry jerry jerry)
- Natural-language: Schedule meeting "m1" starting at 14:30 (slot t1430), occupying the consecutive slots t1430 and t1500. These two 30-minute slots together give a 60-minute meeting from 14:30 to 15:30.
- Participants in the action parameters (as written in the plan): Jerry, Jerry, Jerry (the plan uses Jerry for all three participant parameters).

Validation (compliance with the specification):
- The chosen start time is 14:30 and the meeting duration is 60 minutes (14:30–15:30), matching the environment constraints (work hours 09:00–17:00, 30-minute resolution, 60-minute meeting).
- According to the provided availabilities in the problem, Michelle, Steven and Jerry are all free at the required slots (t1430 and t1500), so this scheduled meeting time fits all participants.

Result: Meeting m1 is scheduled to start at 14:30 and run until 15:30 on Monday; the plan action that produced this is (schedule-meeting m1 t1430 t1500 jerry jerry jerry).
