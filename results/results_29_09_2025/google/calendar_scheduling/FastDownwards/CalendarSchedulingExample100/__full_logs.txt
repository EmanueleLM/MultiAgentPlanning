PROBLEM
------------------------------
You are an expert at scheduling meetings. You are given a few constraints on the existing schedule of each participant, the meeting duration, and possibly some preferences on the meeting time. Note there exists a solution that works with existing schedule of every participant. Here are a few example tasks and solutions:

TASK: You need to schedule a meeting for Diana, Ethan and Janet for half an hour between the work hours of 9:00 to 17:00 on Monday. 

Here are the existing schedules for everyone during the day: 
Diana has blocked their calendar on Monday during 11:30 to 12:00, 13:00 to 13:30; 
Ethanhas no meetings the whole day.
Janet is busy on Monday during 9:00 to 10:00, 12:30 to 13:00, 14:00 to 15:00, 15:30 to 17:00; 

Janet do not want to meet on Monday after 12:00. Find a time that works for everyone's schedule and constraints.
