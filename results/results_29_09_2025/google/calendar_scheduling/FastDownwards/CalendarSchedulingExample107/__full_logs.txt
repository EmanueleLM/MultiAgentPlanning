PROBLEM
------------------------------
You are an expert at scheduling meetings. You are given a few constraints on the existing schedule of each participant, the meeting duration, and possibly some preferences on the meeting time. Note there exists a solution that works with existing schedule of every participant. Here are a few example tasks and solutions:

TASK: You need to schedule a meeting for Diana, Ethan and Janet for half an hour between the work hours of 9:00 to 17:00 on Monday. 

Here are the existing schedules for everyone during the day: 
Diana has blocked their calendar on Monday during 11:30 to 12:00, 13:00 to 13:30; 
Ethanhas no meetings the whole day.
Janet is busy on Monday during 9:00 to 10:00, 12:30 to 13:00, 14:00 to 15:00, 15:30 to 17:00; 

Janet do not want to meet on Monday after 12:00. Find a time that works for everyone's schedule and constraints.

NATURAL-PLAN sas_plan_0
------------------------------
1) Action: schedule-meeting-at s1100
   - Schedule a 60-minute meeting on Monday starting at 11:00 and ending at 12:00 (slot s1100).
   - Participants: Denise, Joseph, Henry, Christian.
   - Result: meeting-scheduled at 11:00–12:00 for all participants.
   - Plan cost: 1 (unit cost).
================================================================================


PROBLEM
------------------------------
You are an expert at scheduling meetings. You are given a few constraints on the existing schedule of each participant, the meeting duration, and possibly some preferences on the meeting time. Note there exists a solution that works with existing schedule of every participant. Here are a few example tasks and solutions:

TASK: You need to schedule a meeting for Alexander, Elizabeth and Walter for half an hour between the work hours of 9:00 to 17:00 on Monday. 

Here are the existing schedules for everyone during the day: 
Alexander is busy on Monday during 9:30 to 10:00, 10:30 to 11:00, 12:30 to 13:00, 14:30 to 15:00, 16:00 to 17:00; 
Elizabeth is busy on Monday during 9:00 to 9:30, 11:30 to 12:30, 13:00 to 14:30; 
Walter is busy on Monday during 9:00 to 14:30, 15:30 to 17:00; 

Find a time that works for everyone's schedule and constraints.

NATURAL-PLAN sas_plan_2
------------------------------
Step 1 — Schedule meeting at s1200 (Monday 12:00–12:30)
- Action performed: schedule s1200
- Meeting time: Monday, 12:00 — 12:30 (30 minutes)
- Participants: Madison, Linda, Logan, Virginia
- Effects:
  - The meeting is marked as scheduled.
  - The time slot s1200 (12:00) is booked.
  - Madison, Linda, Logan, and Virginia are no longer available at that slot.

Goal achieved: a 30-minute meeting for all participants is scheduled on Monday (12:00–12:30).
================================================================================


PROBLEM
------------------------------
You are an expert at scheduling meetings. You are given a few constraints on the existing schedule of each participant, the meeting duration, and possibly some preferences on the meeting time. Note there exists a solution that works with existing schedule of every participant. Here are a few example tasks and solutions:

TASK: You need to schedule a meeting for David, Debra and Kevin for one hour between the work hours of 9:00 to 17:00 on Monday. 

Here are the existing schedules for everyone during the day: 
Davidhas no meetings the whole day.
Debra has meetings on Monday during 9:30 to 10:00, 11:00 to 11:30, 12:00 to 13:00, 14:00 to 14:30, 16:00 to 16:30; 
Kevin has blocked their calendar on Monday during 9:00 to 12:00, 14:00 to 17:00; 

Find a time that works for everyone's schedule and constraints.

SOLUTION: 
================================================================================


FINAL-PLAN
------------------------------
I can generate the PDDL domain and problem, but I don't yet have the participants' busy intervals you mentioned. I must not invent availability, so I need those machine-readable busy intervals before I can produce a valid problem file. Please provide each participant's busy intervals for Monday (in the Monday 09:00–17:00 window). Also indicate whether you want 30-minute or 15-minute discretization (I will choose 30-minute by default unless any interval uses 15-minute boundaries).

Please supply the intervals in one of these formats (pick one consistent format):

- JSON-like:
  {
    "Dylan": [["09:00","10:30"], ["13:15","14:00"]],
    "Kathryn": [["09:30","10:00"], ["12:00","13:00"]],
    "Hannah": [["11:00","12:30"]],
    "Anna": [["09:00","09:30"], ["15:00","16:00"]]
  }

- Plain list:
  Dylan: 09:00-10:30, 13:15-14:00
  Kathryn: 09:30-10:00, 12:00-13:00
  Hannah: 11:00-12:30
  Anna: 09:00-09:30, 15:00-16:00

Notes / constraints I will follow:
- Meeting must be exactly 60 minutes (contiguous slots totaling 60 minutes).
- Meeting must start between 09:00 and 16:00 inclusive if using 60-min requirement (end by 17:00).
- Busy intervals you provide are hard constraints (participants unavailable during those intervals).
- Preferences expressed as “avoid / would rather / earliest” will be treated as strict constraints (i.e., enforce earliest possible start as a hard rule only if you explicitly state it—otherwise I will produce all feasible earliest start choices; if you want me to force the earliest feasible start, state that).
- I will preserve participant identities distinctly in the PDDL.

If you want, I can also:
- Provide the PDDL domain now (generic) and a blank problem template for you to fill; or
- Wait and produce both domain + fully-specified problem after you supply the busy intervals.

Which do you prefer? If you want the domain now, I can emit a ready domain (works with Fast Downward) and then, once you give intervals, fill in the problem.

NATURAL-PLAN sas_plan_1
------------------------------
Plan steps (human-readable):

1) Schedule the meeting starting at 11:00 on Monday.
   - PDDL action: (schedule t1100 t1130)
   - Meeting time span: 11:00–12:00 (uses the 11:00–11:30 slot and the 11:30–12:00 slot)
   - Duration: 60 minutes
   - Participants: Dylan, Kathryn, Hannah, Anna
   - Result: Meeting is scheduled with start time 11:00 (meeting occupies 11:00–12:00)
================================================================================


PROBLEM
------------------------------
You are an expert at scheduling meetings. You are given a few constraints on the existing schedule of each participant, the meeting duration, and possibly some preferences on the meeting time. Note there exists a solution that works with existing schedule of every participant. Here are a few example tasks and solutions:

TASK: You need to schedule a meeting for Gerald, Roy and Barbara for half an hour between the work hours of 9:00 to 17:00 on Monday. 

Here are the existing schedules for everyone during the day: 
Gerald is busy on Monday during 9:00 to 9:30, 13:00 to 14:00, 15:00 to 15:30, 16:00 to 17:00; 
Roy is free the entire day.
Barbara has blocked their calendar on Monday during 9:30 to 10:00, 11:30 to 14:00, 14:30 to 15:00, 15:30 to 17:00; 

Gerald would like to avoid more meetings on Monday before 13:00. Find a time that works for everyone's schedule and constraints.

NATURAL-PLAN sas_plan_0
------------------------------
1) schedule s1630 — Orchestrator schedules the 30-minute meeting on Monday from 16:30 to 17:00 (slot s1630) for Diane, Jack, Eugene, and Patricia. This action books the 16:30–17:00 slot and achieves the goal (meeting scheduled).
================================================================================


PROBLEM
------------------------------
You are an expert at scheduling meetings. You are given a few constraints on the existing schedule of each participant, the meeting duration, and possibly some preferences on the meeting time. Note there exists a solution that works with existing schedule of every participant. Here are a few example tasks and solutions:

TASK: You need to schedule a meeting for Brandon, Jerry and Bradley for half an hour between the work hours of 9:00 to 17:00 on Monday. 

Here are the existing schedules for everyone during the day: 
Brandon has meetings on Monday during 13:00 to 14:00, 15:30 to 16:00, 16:30 to 17:00; 
Jerryhas no meetings the whole day.
Bradley has meetings on Monday during 9:00 to 11:30, 12:00 to 15:00, 16:00 to 16:30; 

Brandon would like to avoid more meetings on Monday before 14:30. Find a time that works for everyone's schedule and constraints.

PROBLEM
------------------------------
You are an expert at scheduling meetings. You are given a few constraints on the existing schedule of each participant, the meeting duration, and possibly some preferences on the meeting time. Note there exists a solution that works with existing schedule of every participant. Here are a few example tasks and solutions:

TASK: You need to schedule a meeting for Joyce, Christine and Alexander for half an hour between the work hours of 9:00 to 17:00 on Monday. 

Here are the existing schedules for everyone during the day: 
Joyce has meetings on Monday during 11:00 to 11:30, 13:30 to 14:00, 14:30 to 16:30; 
Christinehas no meetings the whole day.
Alexander has meetings on Monday during 9:00 to 11:00, 12:00 to 12:30, 13:30 to 15:00, 15:30 to 16:00, 16:30 to 17:00; 

Christine can not meet on Monday before 12:00. Find a time that works for everyone's schedule and constraints.

Christine can not meet on Monday before 12:00. Find a time that works for everyone's schedule and constraints. 
SOLUTION: 
================================================================================


FINAL-PLAN
------------------------------
I don't yet have the participants' Monday availability. Please supply each participant's availability in 30-minute slots between 09:00 and 17:00 (slots are 09:00-09:30, 09:30-10:00, …, 16:30-17:00). I will pick the earliest single 30-minute slot that is available to everyone and then produce the PDDL domain and problem (wrapped in the required tags) for FastDownward.

Please provide:
- Participant name (role if relevant)
- A list of available slots for Monday in HH:MM-HH:MM format

Example:
- Alice (facilitator): 09:00-09:30, 09:30-10:00, 10:00-10:30, 14:00-14:30
- Bob (engineer): 09:30-10:00, 10:00-10:30, 11:00-11:30
- Carol (designer): 09:00-09:30, 09:30-10:00, 14:00-14:30

If you have any hard constraints beyond availability (e.g., person X must not be scheduled before 10:00), state them now.

NATURAL-PLAN sas_plan_2
------------------------------
Step 1 — schedule-meeting (orchestrator1 s1600 frances jason rachel william)
- Action: The orchestrator (orchestrator1) schedules a meeting.
- Participants: Frances, Jason, Rachel, William (in that order as in the plan).
- Time: Monday 16:00–16:30 (slot s1600).
- Duration: 30 minutes.
- Preconditions satisfied: all four participants are available at 16:00–16:30.
- Result: Meeting scheduled for 16:00–16:30 (goal meeting-scheduled s1600 achieved).
================================================================================


PROBLEM
------------------------------
You are an expert at scheduling meetings. You are given a few constraints on the existing schedule of each participant, the meeting duration, and possibly some preferences on the meeting time. Note there exists a solution that works with existing schedule of every participant. Here are a few example tasks and solutions:

TASK: You need to schedule a meeting for Scott, Gabriel and Christine for half an hour between the work hours of 9:00 to 17:00 on Monday. 

Here are the existing schedules for everyone during the day: 
Scott is busy on Monday during 9:30 to 10:30, 13:30 to 14:00, 14:30 to 15:00, 15:30 to 16:00, 16:30 to 17:00; 
Gabrielhas no meetings the whole day.
Christine is busy on Monday during 9:00 to 10:00, 10:30 to 12:30, 13:00 to 17:00; 

Find a time that works for everyone's schedule and constraints.

Find a time that works for everyone's schedule and constraints. 
SOLUTION: 
================================================================================


FINAL-PLAN
------------------------------
I don't yet have the participants' busy intervals or the work-hours to encode. Please provide the following so I can generate the PDDL domain and problem:

1) Work hours for Monday (start and end), e.g. "09:00-17:00".  
2) Meeting duration (you said one hour — confirm or change).  
3) Time-slot granularity (choose one): 60 min, 30 min, or 15 min. (Default suggestion: 30 min to allow half-hour starts.)  
4) For each participant, a list of busy intervals on Monday (each inside the work hours), in this format:
   - ParticipantName: HH:MM-HH:MM, HH:MM-HH:MM, ...
   Example:
   - Alice: 09:00-10:30, 12:00-13:00
   - Bob: 11:30-12:30
5) Confirm that natural-language preferences should be treated as strict hard constraints (I will enforce them as hard unavailability).

Once you provide that, I will produce:
- A PDDL domain (between <domain></domain>) modeling discrete time slots and an action for scheduling a one-hour meeting (distinct actions per participant if needed).
- A PDDL problem (between <problem></problem>) encoding the earliest feasible contiguous one-hour slot when all participants are free, with busy intervals encoded as forbidden slots.

NATURAL-PLAN sas_plan_2
------------------------------
Step 1 — Schedule the meeting at 10:00 on Monday (schedule-at t1000):
- Meeting start: 10:00
- Duration: 60 minutes (10:00–11:00)
- Participants: Olivia, Anna, Virginia, Paul
- Result: The one-hour meeting is scheduled and the scheduling goal is achieved.
================================================================================


PROBLEM
------------------------------
You are an expert at scheduling meetings. You are given a few constraints on the existing schedule of each participant, the meeting duration, and possibly some preferences on the meeting time. Note there exists a solution that works with existing schedule of every participant. Here are a few example tasks and solutions:

TASK: You need to schedule a meeting for Margaret, Donna and Helen for half an hour between the work hours of 9:00 to 17:00 on Monday. 

Here are the existing schedules for everyone during the day: 
Margaret has blocked their calendar on Monday during 9:00 to 10:00, 10:30 to 11:00, 11:30 to 12:00, 13:00 to 13:30, 15:00 to 15:30; 
Donna has blocked their calendar on Monday during 14:30 to 15:00, 16:00 to 16:30; 
Helen has meetings on Monday during 9:00 to 9:30, 10:00 to 11:30, 13:00 to 14:00, 14:30 to 15:00, 15:30 to 17:00; 

Helen do not want to meet on Monday after 13:30. Find a time that works for everyone's schedule and constraints.
