NATURAL-PLAN sas_plan_2
------------------------------
Summary / conventions
- Locations: haight = Haight‑Ashbury, sunset = Sunset District.
- Time tokens map to clock times starting at t0 = 09:00. Each increment of 15 (e.g., t15) = +15 minutes.
- All steps below correspond exactly to the actions in the provided plan (26 steps). The repeated "travel-visitor haight haight" actions are used here as time-advancing stays at Haight‑Ashbury.

Plan (human-readable steps)

1. (travel-visitor haight haight t0 t15) — Stay at Haight‑Ashbury from 09:00 to 09:15 (15 minutes).
2. (travel-visitor haight haight t15 t30) — Stay at Haight‑Ashbury from 09:15 to 09:30 (15 minutes).
3. (travel-visitor haight haight t30 t45) — Stay at Haight‑Ashbury from 09:30 to 09:45 (15 minutes).
4. (travel-visitor haight haight t45 t60) — Stay at Haight‑Ashbury from 09:45 to 10:00 (15 minutes).
5. (travel-visitor haight haight t60 t75) — Stay at Haight‑Ashbury from 10:00 to 10:15 (15 minutes).
6. (travel-visitor haight haight t75 t90) — Stay at Haight‑Ashbury from 10:15 to 10:30 (15 minutes).
7. (travel-visitor haight haight t90 t105) — Stay at Haight‑Ashbury from 10:30 to 10:45 (15 minutes).
8. (travel-visitor haight haight t105 t120) — Stay at Haight‑Ashbury from 10:45 to 11:00 (15 minutes).
9. (travel-visitor haight haight t120 t135) — Stay at Haight‑Ashbury from 11:00 to 11:15 (15 minutes).
10. (travel-visitor haight haight t135 t150) — Stay at Haight‑Ashbury from 11:15 to 11:30 (15 minutes).
11. (travel-visitor haight haight t150 t165) — Stay at Haight‑Ashbury from 11:30 to 11:45 (15 minutes).
12. (travel-visitor haight haight t165 t180) — Stay at Haight‑Ashbury from 11:45 to 12:00 (15 minutes).
13. (travel-visitor haight haight t180 t195) — Stay at Haight‑Ashbury from 12:00 to 12:15 (15 minutes).
14. (travel-visitor haight haight t195 t210) — Stay at Haight‑Ashbury from 12:15 to 12:30 (15 minutes).
15. (travel-visitor haight haight t210 t225) — Stay at Haight‑Ashbury from 12:30 to 12:45 (15 minutes).
16. (travel-visitor haight haight t225 t240) — Stay at Haight‑Ashbury from 12:45 to 13:00 (15 minutes).
17. (travel-visitor haight haight t240 t255) — Stay at Haight‑Ashbury from 13:00 to 13:15 (15 minutes).
18. (travel-visitor haight haight t255 t270) — Stay at Haight‑Ashbury from 13:15 to 13:30 (15 minutes).
19. (travel-visitor haight haight t270 t285) — Stay at Haight‑Ashbury from 13:30 to 13:45 (15 minutes).
20. (travel-visitor haight haight t285 t300) — Stay at Haight‑Ashbury from 13:45 to 14:00 (15 minutes).
21. (travel-visitor haight haight t300 t315) — Stay at Haight‑Ashbury from 14:00 to 14:15 (15 minutes).
22. (travel-visitor haight haight t315 t330) — Stay at Haight‑Ashbury from 14:15 to 14:30 (15 minutes).
23. (travel-visitor haight haight t330 t345) — Stay at Haight‑Ashbury from 14:30 to 14:45 (15 minutes).
24. (travel-visitor haight haight t345 t360) — Stay at Haight‑Ashbury from 14:45 to 15:00 (15 minutes).
25. (travel-visitor haight sunset t360 t375) — Travel from Haight‑Ashbury to Sunset District from 15:00 to 15:15 (15 minutes travel).
26. (meet-visitor-jessica sunset t375 t465) — Meet Jessica at Sunset District from 15:15 to 16:45 (90 minutes). This satisfies Jessica’s required minimum meeting duration and falls within her availability (15:15–20:15).

Outcome: Meeting achieved (met) — visitor meets Jessica for 90 minutes starting at 15:15.

Integrate candidate schedules and availability to produce a complete PDDL domain and a PDDL problem that the FastDownwards solver can accept. Use STRIPS-style definitions where possible, model time discretely in minutes or in suitable time steps, and ensure the solution enforces that a meeting with Mary lasts at least 75 minutes within her availability window. Keep actions distinct and labeled for the visitor and for travel. Enclose the PDDL domain between <domain></domain> tags and the PDDL problem between <problem></problem> tags.",

Integrate these inputs to create a final PDDL domain and problem that encodes the locations Union Square and Nob Hill, travel durations, the visitor arrival at 09:00, Mary's availability from 12:00 to 16:15, and the constraint that the meeting with Mary must be at least 75 minutes. The domain should include actions for 'travel' and 'meet' and a metric to maximize the number of meetings or to maximize total meeting time. Target the FastDownwards solver. Provide the domain and problem enclosed in <domain></domain> and <problem></problem> tags. Do not assume additional friends beyond those implied; focus on integrating schedules and enforcing constraints."

Final state: meeting started at t180, met-count reached c75, and meeting-active is false — goal achieved.
