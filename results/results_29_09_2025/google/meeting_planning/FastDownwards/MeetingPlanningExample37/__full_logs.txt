NATURAL-PLAN sas_plan_2
------------------------------
Summary / conventions
- Locations: haight = Haight‑Ashbury, sunset = Sunset District.
- Time tokens map to clock times starting at t0 = 09:00. Each increment of 15 (e.g., t15) = +15 minutes.
- All steps below correspond exactly to the actions in the provided plan (26 steps). The repeated "travel-visitor haight haight" actions are used here as time-advancing stays at Haight‑Ashbury.

Plan (human-readable steps)

1. (travel-visitor haight haight t0 t15) — Stay at Haight‑Ashbury from 09:00 to 09:15 (15 minutes).

Integrate candidate schedules and availability to produce a complete PDDL domain and a PDDL problem that the FastDownwards solver can accept. Use STRIPS-style definitions where possible, model time discretely in minutes or in suitable time steps, and ensure the solution enforces that a meeting with Mary lasts at least 75 minutes within her availability window. Keep actions distinct and labeled for the visitor and for travel. Enclose the PDDL domain between <domain></domain> tags and the PDDL problem between <problem></problem> tags.",

Integrate these inputs to create a final PDDL domain and problem that encodes the locations Union Square and Nob Hill, travel durations, the visitor arrival at 09:00, Mary's availability from 12:00 to 16:15, and the constraint that the meeting with Mary must be at least 75 minutes. The domain should include actions for 'travel' and 'meet' and a metric to maximize the number of meetings or to maximize total meeting time. Target the FastDownwards solver. Provide the domain and problem enclosed in <domain></domain> and <problem></problem> tags. Do not assume additional friends beyond those implied; focus on integrating schedules and enforcing constraints."

  ;; - Time units are minutes measured from midnight. 09:00 = 540, 13:30 = 810, 14:30 = 870.
  ;; - Only the public inputs are modeled as persons/friends. No other friends are invented.
  ;; - Meeting action is modeled at the minimal required duration (15 minutes). This is a modeling
  ;;   choice made to encode the "minimum 15 minutes" hard constraint concretely.
  ;; - The traveler has no location facts before 09:00; the traveler appears at Alamo Square exactly
  ;;   at 09:00 (timed initial literal). This prevents any travel before arrival.
  ;; - Matthew's presence and availability are exactly the provided window 13:30-14:30 and are
  ;;   encoded with timed initial literals. No other availability is assumed.
  ;; - Preferences such as "earliest feasible meeting" are encoded by the planner seeking the earliest
  ;;   schedule that satisfies constraints; the domain gives the planner the necessary temporal constraints.

  (:init
    ;; numeric fluent initialization

    ;; This means the predicate (at-agent traveler alamo) becomes true at t=540.

NATURAL-PLAN sas_plan_3
------------------------------
1) travel-traveler-md-to-ph
   - Action: Traveler travels from Marina District to Pacific Heights.
   - Start time: 09:00 (t540). Travel duration (per public info): 7 minutes.
   - Arrival time (implied): 09:07.
   - Effect: Traveler is now at Pacific Heights.

2) advance-to-1140
   - Action: Advance time until 19:00 (t1140).
   - Effect: Time jumps forward from 09:00 to 19:00; Margaret becomes present at Pacific Heights at 19:00.
   - Note: This models waiting at Pacific Heights until Margaret's availability window begins.

3) meet-traveler-margaret-at-ph
   - Action: Traveler meets Margaret at Pacific Heights.
   - Start time: 19:00 (t1140). Minimum meeting duration required by Margaret: 15 minutes.
   - End time: 19:15 (t1155).
   - Effect: Meeting with Margaret is completed (met-margaret), satisfying the minimum duration and avoiding penalty.

Outcome: Goal achieved (met-or-penalized satisfied by meeting Margaret). Total plan cost = 0.

DOMAIN
------------------------------
(define (domain multi-agent-meeting)
  ;; Multi-agent meeting domain (classical, time-sliced encoding).
  ;; Assumptions (conservative) - documented here:
  ;;  - Time is discretized in 1-minute steps starting at 09:00 as t0 (09:00)
  ;;    and t300 = 14:00 (09:00 + 300 minutes).
  ;;  - The meeting must be contiguous for at least 90 minutes and must
  ;;    occur entirely within Jeffrey's availability (12:15-14:00).
  ;;    12:15 is minute 195 after 09:00; 14:00 is minute 300 after 09:00.
  ;;  - Therefore meeting start must be in the inclusive range t195..t210
  ;;    (because start + 90 <= 300).
  ;;  - Jeffrey's inputs did not specify his location; conservatively we
  ;;    assume Jeffrey will be at Bayview for the entirety of his
  ;;    availability window. This is encoded as facts in the problem.
  ;;  - Traveler starts at Bayview at t0 (09:00). The traveler may wait
  ;;    minute-by-minute (modeled by the "wait" action) or travel (19-minute
  ;;    travel action is provided). Travel durations are encoded via
  ;;    precomputed next19 relations in the problem file.
  ;;  - Presence facts (at agent loc tX) are monotonic: wait and travel
  ;;    actions add future-minute presence facts without deleting earlier
  ;;    ones. This lets the meeting action check presence for a contiguous
  ;;    block of minutes. This is a conservative modeling choice suitable
  ;;    for timeline-style planning in classical encodings.
  ;;
  ;; Note: We encode the objective indirectly: each wait action increases
  ;; (total-cost) by 1. Minimizing total-cost therefore encourages the
  ;; planner to minimize waiting (i.e., schedule the meeting as early as
  ;; possible consistent with constraints).

  ;; (These actions reference time constants that are declared in the problem.)
  ;; Effects set the met predicate to satisfy the goal. No cost increase for
  ;; the meeting itself (we want to minimize waiting leading to earlier meeting).
  ;; --- The specific meet actions are intentionally placed here as action
  ;;     schemas that refer to the problem's time constants.

  ;;     present for each of 90 consecutive minutes).
