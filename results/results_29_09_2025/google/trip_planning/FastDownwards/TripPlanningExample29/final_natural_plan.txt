Summary / final state:

- Frankfurt: Day 8 (1 day)
- Krakow: Days 9,10 (2 days)

This itinerary satisfies the wedding constraint (present in Krakow during the Day 9 → Day 10 window) and fits the 10-day total. Note: the traveler's original per-city requests (Krakow 2, Dubrovnik 7, Frankfurt 3 = 12 days) conflicted with the 10-day total; the plan resolves this by reducing the stay in Frankfurt to 1 day.
