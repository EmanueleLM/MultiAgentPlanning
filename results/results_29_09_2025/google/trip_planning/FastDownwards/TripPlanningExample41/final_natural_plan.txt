Summary: No actions are required — the provided plan is empty (cost = 0) because the initial state already satisfies the goal. The final itinerary is already encoded in the problem’s initial state. Below is the human-readable itinerary and relevant timing/constraints.

Overall
- Total trip length: 13 days (days d1 … d13).
- The initial state already assigns every day to a city and meets the goal; therefore no fly/stay actions are needed.

Itinerary (day ranges and durations)
- Days d1–d6: Stockholm — duration 6 days.
  - Must-attend conference days: d1 and d6 (attend in Stockholm).
  - Stockholm is the starting city (pref-start satisfied).
- Days d7–d11: Athens — duration 5 days.
- Days d12–d13: Mykonos — duration 2 days.

Transitions / flight connectivity (feasibility notes)
- To move from Stockholm on day d6 to Athens on day d7 you must use a direct Stockholm↔Athens connection. Public information lists a direct flight between Stockholm and Athens, so this transition is possible.
- To move from Athens on day d11 to Mykonos on day d12 you must use a direct Athens↔Mykonos connection. Public information lists a direct flight between Athens and Mykonos, so this transition is possible.
- There is no direct flight between Stockholm and Mykonos; the itinerary uses Athens as the connecting city, which is consistent with the direct-flight constraints.

Verification
- Day assignment counts: 6 (Stockholm) + 5 (Athens) + 2 (Mykonos) = 13 days — matches total_days = 13.
- Required must-attend days (Stockholm d1 and d6) are included.
- All moves can be made using only listed direct flights.

Plan status
- Plan is empty (no actions to execute); initial state already matches the final goal.
