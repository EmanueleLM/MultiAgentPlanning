Here is the minimal PDDL **domain** and **problem** that encode the situation you described.  
All the facts that you supplied are used and no extra assumptions are added.

### Domain file – `truckdriver-domain.pddl`

```pddl
(define (domain truckdriver)
  (:requirements :typing :strips :adl :negative-preconditions :equality)
  (:types vehicle person item location)

  (:predicates
    (at ?x - (either vehicle person item) ?l - location)   ; where an object is
    (in ?i - item ?v - vehicle)                            ; item is inside a vehicle
    (adjacent ?l1 - location ?l2 - location)               ; travel connectivity
  )

  ;------------------
  ; Actions
  ;------------------
  (:action move
    :parameters (?v - vehicle ?from - location ?to - location)
    :precondition (and
                     (at ?v ?from)
                     (adjacent ?from ?to))
    :effect (and
               (not (at ?v ?from))
               (at ?v ?to))
  )

  (:action load
    :parameters (?v - vehicle ?i - item ?l - location)
    :precondition (and
                     (at ?v ?l)
                     (at ?i ?l))
    :effect (and
               (not (at ?i ?l))
               (in ?i ?v))
  )

  (:action unload
    :parameters (?v - vehicle ?i - item ?l - location)
    :precondition (and
                     (in ?i ?v)
                     (at ?v ?l))
    :effect (and
               (not (in ?i ?v))
               (at ?i ?l))
  )
)
```

### Problem file – `deliver-problem.pddl`

```pddl
(define (problem deliver-to-house)
  (:domain truckdriver)

  ; Objects: one truck, one package, two locations
  (:objects
    truck1 - vehicle
    package1 - item
    post-office house - location
  )

  ; Static facts – the two locations are adjacent (undirected)
  (:init
    ; Initial locations
    (at truck1 post-office)
    (at package1 post-office)

    ; Connectivity
    (adjacent post-office house)
    (adjacent house post-office)
  )

  ; Goal: the package must be at the house
  (:goal (at package1 house))
)
```

---  

### Sample plan (for reference)

If you run an off‑the‑shelf planner on the above files, one optimal plan will look like:

```
1  (load truck1 package1 post-office)
2  (move truck1 post-office house)
3  (unload truck1 package1 house)
```

This plan uses exactly the actions and predicates defined in the domain and achieves the goal that the package is delivered to the house.
