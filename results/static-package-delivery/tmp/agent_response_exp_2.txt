**Step‑by‑step reasoning**

| Step | Action | Rationale |
|------|--------|-----------|
| 1 | Both truck and package are at the post‑office. | Given by the knowledge base. |
| 2 | Load the package onto the truck. | The truck must be at the same location as the package, and the package must not already be inside a truck. |
| 3 | Move the truck to the house. | The truck can travel between the post‑office and the house. |
| 4 | Unload the package at the house. | The truck must be at the house and the package must be inside the truck. |
| 5 | The goal is achieved when the package is at the house and no longer inside the truck. | This matches the global goal. |

The PDDL files below encode the objects, predicates, and actions needed to realize that plan.

### Domain file   (delivery-domain.pddl)

```pddl
(define (domain delivery)
  (:requirements :typing)
  (:types truck package location)

  (:predicates
    (at-truck    ?t - truck      ?l - location)   ; truck’s current location
    (at-pkg      ?p - package    ?l - location)   ; package’s current location
    (in          ?p - package    ?t - truck)       ; package inside truck
  )

  ; 1. Load the package onto the truck
  (:action load
    :parameters (?t - truck ?p - package ?l - location)
    :precondition (and
                     (at-truck ?t ?l)
                     (at-pkg   ?p ?l)
                     (not (in ?p ?t))
                  )
    :effect (and
               (in ?p ?t)
               (not (at-pkg ?p ?l))
             )
  )

  ; 2. Unload the package from the truck
  (:action unload
    :parameters (?t - truck ?p - package ?l - location)
    :precondition (and
                     (at-truck ?t ?l)
                     (in       ?p ?t)
                  )
    :effect (and
               (at-pkg ?p ?l)
               (not (in ?p ?t))
             )
  )

  ; 3. Move the truck from one location to the other
  (:action move
    :parameters (?t - truck ?l1 - location ?l2 - location)
    :precondition (at-truck ?t ?l1)
    :effect (and
               (at-truck ?t ?l2)
               (not (at-truck ?t ?l1))
            )
  )
)
```

### Problem file   (delivery-problem.pddl)

```pddl
(define (problem delivery-problem)
  (:domain delivery)

  (:objects
    truck1                         - truck
    pkg1                           - package
    postoffice  house              - location
  )

  (:init
    (at-truck truck1 postoffice)    ; truck starts at the post‑office
    (at-pkg   pkg1 postoffice)      ; package starts at the post‑office
  )

  (:goal
    (and
      (at-pkg pkg1 house)        ; package must be at the house
      (not (in pkg1 truck1))     ; and must not be inside the truck
    )
  )
)
```

These two files together form a complete, self‑contained PDDL specification for the described “truck driver” task. They can be fed to any conforming PDDL planner, which will produce a plan such as:

```
(load truck1 pkg1 postoffice)
(move truck1 postoffice house)
(unload truck1 pkg1 house)
```

That plan satisfies all the constraints and achieves the required goal.
