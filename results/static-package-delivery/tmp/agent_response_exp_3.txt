**PDDL Problem (truck-delivery-problem.pddl)**  
```pddl
(define (problem deliver-package)
  (:domain truck-delivery)

  (:objects
    post-office   house   - location
  )

  (:init
    (truck-at post-office)     ;; the truck starts at the post‑office
    (package-at post-office)   ;; the package also starts there
  )

  (:goal
    (package-at house)         ;; the end‑state we want
  )
)
```

### How the plan is obtained

1. **load post‑office** – truck and package are together, so the package is loaded into the truck.  
   *Resulting state*: `truck-at post-office`, `in-package`.  
2. **move post-office house** – the truck drives to the house.  
   *Resulting state*: `truck-at house`, `in-package`.  
3. **unload house** – the package is taken out of the truck at the house.  
   *Resulting state*: `truck-at house`, `package-at house`.  

The goal `(package-at house)` is satisfied after step 3. The domain and problem files above are minimal and contain no extra assumptions beyond the information given.
