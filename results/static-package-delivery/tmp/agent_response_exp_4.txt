Below is a minimal PDDL specification that captures exactly the facts you supplied.

**Domain file –  `truckpkg-domain.pddl`**

```pddl

**Problem file –  `deliver-pkg-problem.pddl`**

```pddl
(define (problem deliver-pkg)
  (:domain truckpkg)

  ;; Objects -------------------------------------------------------
  (:objects
    t1 - truck
    pkg1 - package
    postoffice house - location)

  ;; Initial state -------------------------------------------------
  (:init
    (at t1 postoffice)            ; truck starts at the post‑office
    (at-pkg pkg1 postoffice)      ; package starts at the post‑office
    (adjacent postoffice house)   ; the only two reachable locations
    (adjacent house postoffice))

  ;; Goal ----------------------------------------------------------
  (:goal (at-pkg pkg1 house))
)
```

--------------------------------------------------------------------
*Explanation of the model*  

* `at` and `at-pkg` distinguish the truck’s position from the package’s position.  
* `adjacent` encodes that the truck can move only between the two locations.  
* `move` changes the truck’s location.  
* `load` brings the package into the truck only when both are at the same location.  
* `unload` places the package at the truck’s current location.  

Running any standard PDDL planner on these files will produce a plan that loads the package from the post‑office, drives the truck to the house, and then unloads the package, satisfying the goal `package at house`.
