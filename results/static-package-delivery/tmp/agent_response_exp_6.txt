Here are two minimal PDDL files that model the situation you described – one domain file and one problem file.

**Domain (delivery\_domain.pddl)**  

```pddl
(define (domain delivery)
  (:requirements :strips)
  (:types truck package location)

  (:predicates
    ; The truck’s current location
    (at-truck    ?t - truck      ?l - location)

    ; The package’s current location when it is not inside the truck
    (at-package  ?p - package    ?l - location)

    ; The package is inside the truck
    (in          ?p - package    ?t - truck)
  )

  ; Move the truck from one location to another
  (:action move
    :parameters (?t - truck ?from - location ?to - location)
    :precondition (at-truck ?t ?from)
    :effect (and
      (not (at-truck ?t ?from))
      (at-truck ?t ?to))
  )

  ; Load a package into the truck
  (:action load
    :parameters (?p - package ?t - truck ?l - location)
    :precondition (and
      (at-package ?p ?l)
      (at-truck    ?t ?l))
    :effect (and
      (not (at-package ?p ?l))
      (in          ?p ?t))
  )

  ; Unload a package from the truck
  (:action unload
    :parameters (?p - package ?t - truck ?l - location)
    :precondition (and
      (in          ?p ?t)
      (at-truck    ?t ?l))
    :effect (and
      (not (in          ?p ?t))
      (at-package ?p ?l))
  )
)
```

**Problem (delivery\_problem.pddl)**  

```pddl
(define (problem deliver-package)
  (:domain delivery)

  (:objects
    truck-1      - truck
    package-1    - package
    post-office  - location
    house        - location
  )

  (:init
    (at-truck   truck-1  post-office)   ; Truck starts at the post office
    (at-package package-1  post-office) ; Package starts at the post office
  )

  (:goal
    (and
      (at-package package-1 house)         ; Package must be at the house
      (not (in package-1 truck-1))        ; And it must not still be inside the truck
    )
  )
)
```

These two files encode exactly the knowledge and goal you provided:

1. **Truck** starts at the **post office**.  
2. **Package** starts at the **post office**.  
3. The truck can **move** to another location, **load** a package when at the same location, and **unload** it.  
4. The goal is that the package is at the **house** and no longer in the truck.

A planner that supports the **:strips** requirement will find the following plan (in plan language):

```
(load  package-1 truck-1  post-office)
(move  truck-1  post-office  house)
(unload package-1 truck-1  house)
```

Feel free to copy the two files into any PDDL-compatible planner to verify the plan.
