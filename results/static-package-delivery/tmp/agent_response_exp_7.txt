Below are two PDDL files that capture the information you gave:  

* **truckdomain.pddl** – the domain that knows how a truck moves, loads, and unloads a single package.  
* **truckproblem.pddl** – the specific problem instance (the only truck, the only package and the two locations).  

The goal is simply that the package ends up at the house.  
No extra facts or assumptions were added.

### `truckdomain.pddl`

```pddl
(define (domain truckdriver)
  (:requirements :typing)           ; we only need plain typing
  (:types
    truck
    package
    location)

  ; ---------- predicates ----------
  (:predicates
    (truck-at   ?t - truck    ?l - location)          ; where the truck is
    (package-at ?p - package ?l - location)          ; where the package is
    (in         ?p - package ?c - truck)             ; package currently inside truck
    (adjacent   ?l1 - location ?l2 - location) )     ; allowed travel link

  ; ---------- actions ----------
  (:action drive
    :parameters (?t - truck ?from - location ?to - location)
    :precondition (and
                    (truck-at ?t ?from)
                    (adjacent ?from ?to))
    :effect (and
              (not (truck-at ?t ?from))
              (truck-at ?t ?to)))

  (:action load-package
    :parameters (?t - truck ?p - package ?l - location)
    :precondition (and
                    (truck-at ?t ?l)
                    (package-at ?p ?l))
    :effect (and
              (not (package-at ?p ?l))
              (in ?p ?t)))

  (:action unload-package
    :parameters (?t - truck ?p - package ?l - location)
    :precondition (and
                    (truck-at ?t ?l)
                    (in ?p ?t))
    :effect (and
              (not (in ?p ?t))
              (package-at ?p ?l)))
)
```

### `truckproblem.pddl`

```pddl
(define (problem deliver-package)
  (:domain truckdriver)

  ; ---------- objects ----------
  (:objects
    truck1          - truck
    package1        - package
    postoffice      - location
    house           - location)

  ; ---------- initial state ----------
  (:init
    (truck-at truck1 postoffice)
    (package-at package1 postoffice)

    ; only one link allows the truck to move
    (adjacent postoffice house)
    (adjacent house postoffice))

  ; ---------- goal ----------
  (:goal
    (package-at package1 house))
)
```

These two files can be fed to any standard PDDL planner.  
The planner will produce the following minimal plan (if you run one):

```
1. (load-package truck1 package1 postoffice)
2. (drive truck1 postoffice house)
3. (unload-package truck1 package1 house)
```

No other assumptions were made beyond what you explicitly supplied.
