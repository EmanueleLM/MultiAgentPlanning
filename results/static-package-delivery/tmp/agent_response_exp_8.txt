Here are two minimal PDDL files that capture exactly the information you gave and will produce a plan that delivers the package to the house.

---

## Domain – `truck-delivery-domain.pddl`

```pddl
(define (domain truck-delivery)
  (:requirements :typing :strips)

  ;--------------------------------------------------------------------
  ; Types
  (:types truck package loc)

  ;--------------------------------------------------------------------
  ; Predicates
  (:predicates
    (at-truck   ?t - truck   ?l - loc)   ; the truck’s current location
    (at-pkg     ?p - package ?l - loc)   ; the package’s current location
    (in-pkg     ?p - package ?t - truck) ; the package is inside the truck
  )

  ;--------------------------------------------------------------------
  ; Actions

  ; Move the truck from one location to another
  (:action move
    :parameters (?t - truck ?from - loc ?to - loc)
    :precondition (at-truck ?t ?from)
    :effect (and
              (not (at-truck ?t ?from))
              (at-truck ?t ?to))
  )

  ; Load the package into the truck (only possible when both are at the same place)
  (:action load
    :parameters (?t - truck ?p - package ?l - loc)
    :precondition (and
                    (at-truck ?t ?l)
                    (at-pkg   ?p ?l)
                    (not (in-pkg ?p ?t)))
    :effect (and
              (not (at-pkg ?p ?l))
              (in-pkg  ?p ?t))
  )

  ; Unload the package from the truck (only possible when the truck is at that place)
  (:action unload
    :parameters (?t - truck ?p - package ?l - loc)
    :precondition (and
                    (at-truck ?t ?l)
                    (in-pkg    ?p ?t))
    :effect (and
              (not (in-pkg ?p ?t))
              (at-pkg   ?p ?l))
  )
)
```

## Problem – `truck-delivery-problem.pddl`

```pddl
(define (problem deliver-pkg)
  (:domain truck-delivery)

  ;--------------------------------------------------------------------
  ; Objects
  (:objects
    truck-1   - truck
    package-1 - package
    post-office - loc
    house       - loc
  )

  ;--------------------------------------------------------------------
  ; Initial situation
  (:init
    ; The truck and the package are both at the post‑office at start
    (at-truck truck-1 post-office)
    (at-pkg   package-1 post-office)
    ; The package is not yet in the truck
    (not (in-pkg package-1 truck-1))
  )

  ;--------------------------------------------------------------------
  ; Goal
  (:goal
    ; The package must be on (i.e., at) the house at the end
    (at-pkg package-1 house)
  )
)
```

### What the files represent

| File | Purpose | Key facts |
|------|---------|-----------|
| `truck-delivery-domain.pddl` | Describes the actions, predicates and typing that allow a truck to move, load a package, and unload it. | *move*, *load*, *unload* actions. |
| `truck-delivery-problem.pddl` | Gives the concrete instance: one truck, one package, two locations, the start configuration, and the goal (“package at the house”). | *truck‑1* at *post‑office*, *package‑1* at *post‑office*, want *package‑1* at *house*. |

These two files can be fed into any standard PDDL planner (e.g., FastDownward, POPF, or Metric-FF). The planner will find a plan such as

```
(load truck-1 package-1 post-office)
(move truck-1 post-office house)
(unload truck-1 package-1 house)
```

which satisfies the goal without introducing any assumptions beyond the information you supplied.
