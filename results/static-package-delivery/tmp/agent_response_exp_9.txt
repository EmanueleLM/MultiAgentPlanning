Below is a minimal PDDL description that captures exactly the situation you described – one truck, one package, two locations (the post‑office and the house).  
It is written in a way that **does not** assume anything you haven’t told me (e.g. more locations, more trucks, or extra constraints).

### How the planner will solve it

A planner that understands this domain will produce a plan like:

```
move   mytruck  post-office  house
unload mytruck  pkg1
```

or, if it chooses to load first (even though the loading is unnecessary here):

```
load   mytruck  pkg1  post-office
move   mytruck  post-office  house
unload mytruck  pkg1
```

Both plans respect all the conditions you supplied: the package moves only by being carried in the truck, the truck visits the house, the package is unloaded at the house, and the final state satisfies the goal.
