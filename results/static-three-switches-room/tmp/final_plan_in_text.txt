Below is a **single** PDDL domain that contains everything the three agents already know (the three switches, the door, the agents’ movements and the requirement that the door opens only when every switch is pressed).  
The problem file puts the three agents somewhere in a tiny 2 × 2 grid, leaves all switches un‑pressed, and then asks a planner to bring every agent to the correct switch, press it and finally open the door – exactly the coordinated behaviour that the three agents must achieve.

## Domain – `multi‑agent‑switches-domain.pddl`

```pddl
(define (domain multi-agent-switches)
  (:requirements :types :strips)

  ;; --------------------------------------------------------------
  ;; types

  (:types agent switch location)

  ;; --------------------------------------------------------------

  (:predicates
    (at ?a - agent ?l - location)          ; where an agent is
    (connected ?l1 - location ?l2 - location)

    (switch-at ?s - switch ?l - location)  ; location of each switch
    (pressed ?s - switch)                  ; switch has been pressed

    (door-open)                            ; the locked door is open
  )

  ;; --------------------------------------------------------------
  ;; actions
  ;; --------------------------------------------------------------
  ;; 1. Move an agent to any *connected* location
  (:action move
    :parameters (?a - agent ?from - location ?to - location)
    :precondition (and
                     (at ?a ?from)
                     (connected ?from ?to))
    :effect (and
              (not (at ?a ?from))
              (at ?a ?to)))

  ;; 2. Press a switch that the agent is standing on
  (:action press
    :parameters (?a - agent ?s - switch)
    :precondition (and
                    (at ?a ?l)
                    (switch-at ?s ?l)
                    (not (pressed ?s)))
    :effect (pressed ?s))

  ;; 3. Open the door only when *all* switches are pressed
  (:action open-door
    :parameters ()
    :precondition (and
                    (pressed red)
                    (pressed green)
                    (pressed blue))
    :effect (door-open))

)
```

### Explanation

* **`connected`** gives the tiny graph over the four squares – the planner can use it to plan moves.
* The press action is only applicable when the agent is on the square that hosts the switch.
* The door can be opened only after the three `pressed` predicates become true.

## Problem – `door‑unlock-problem.pddl`

```pddl
(define (problem door‑unlock‑problem)
  (:domain multi-agent-switches)

  ;; --------------------------------------------------------------

  (:objects

  (:init
    ;; agents start somewhere in the square; they are not on a switch yet
    (at R l01)

    (at B l11)

    ;; connectivity of the 2×2 grid
    (connected l00 l01) (connected l01 l00)

    (connected l01 l11) (connected l11 l01)
    (connected l10 l11) (connected l11 l10)

    ;; where each switch is located
    (switch-at red   l00)
    (switch-at green l11)
    (switch-at blue  l10)

    ;; door is initially closed (door-open is *not* in the initial state)
  )

  ;; --------------------------------------------------------------
  (:goal (door-open))
)
```

### How a planner would solve it

1. **Move every agent to the correct square**  
   *`R` → l00, `G` → l11, `B` → l10* – all moves respect the `connected` links.  
2. **Press the three switches** – the `press` action can be executed once an agent occupies the square of a switch.  
3. **Open the door** – after the last `press` the precondition of `open-door` holds, so that action is executed.

The planner only needs to respect the simple movement constraints; it will generate a plan that has the three agents arrive at their respective switches, press them, and finally execute `open-door`.  
No assumptions beyond what the three agents supplied have been made.
