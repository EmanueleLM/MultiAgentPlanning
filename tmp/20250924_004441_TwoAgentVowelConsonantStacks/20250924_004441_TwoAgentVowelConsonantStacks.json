You will be given the environment initial state, the global goal, and private constraints for two agents (vowel-only and consonant-only). Produce a PDDL domain and a PDDL problem that models the two-agent block-stacking task. The domain must include separate actions for each agent (e.g., pick-vowel, place-vowel, pick-consonant, place-consonant) and enforce: top-only picking, single-block holding per agent, cannot place onto a block that is currently held, vowel/consonant access restrictions, and a global constraint that no more than 3 stacks may exist at any time. Represent stacks and table positions so the goal stacks (exact ordering bottom-to-top) can be specified. Ensure actions clearly indicate which agent performs them, and do not make assumptions beyond the provided information.",
