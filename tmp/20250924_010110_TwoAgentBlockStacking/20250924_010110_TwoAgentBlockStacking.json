Enclose the pddl domain between <domain></domain> tags, and the pddl problem between <problem></problem> tags. Keep the actions for different agents distinct, so that there is no confusion as to which agent performs which action. Ensure constraints: top-only moves, vowel/consonant move permissions, max 3 stacks, each agent holds at most one block, and placement cannot target a block held by the other agent. Model stacks, holding state, and number-of-stacks invariant explicitly.",
