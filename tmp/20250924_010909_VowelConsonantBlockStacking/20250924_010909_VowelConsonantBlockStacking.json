Distinguish actions by agent (e.g., pick-vowel, place-consonant). Ensure at-most-one-held-per-agent, top-only access, category-based permissions, prohibition on placing onto a block currently held, and the max number of stacks constraint are encoded. Output only the domain and problem enclosed in <domain>...</domain> and <problem>...</problem> tags respectively.",
