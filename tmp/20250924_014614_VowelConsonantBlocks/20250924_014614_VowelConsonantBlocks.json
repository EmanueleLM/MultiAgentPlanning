Enclose the pddl domain between <domain></domain> tags, and the pddl problem between <problem></problem> tags. Keep the actions for different agents distinct, so that there is no confusion as to which agent performs which action. Encode holding constraints, stack-count limit (<=3), and agent-specific allowed blocks explicitly.",

Model agents AgentV and AgentC as separate actors with actions to pick and place only their permitted blocks, enforce single-held-block per agent, mutual constraint preventing placing on a held block, and ensure the number of stacks never exceeds 3.
