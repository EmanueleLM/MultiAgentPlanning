Enclose the PDDL domain between <domain></domain> tags and the PDDL problem between <problem></problem> tags. Keep actions distinct by agent (e.g., move-vagent, move-cagent) and ensure the model prevents any move that would violate the constraints. Do not add assumptions beyond the provided information.",
