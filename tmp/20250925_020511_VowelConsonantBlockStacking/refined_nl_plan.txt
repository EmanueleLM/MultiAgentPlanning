Below is a step-by-step, human-readable execution of the provided PDDL plan. Each step lists a timestamp (incrementing by 1 unit per action), the agent performing the action, and a concise description of what the agent picks up or places and from/to where. Block and slot names use the same identifiers as the PDDL (A, B, C, D, E, F, G, I; slot1, slot2, slot3). All actions exactly match the supplied plan (no additions or deletions).

Note: "pick X from Y" means the agent picks block X which was on Y (Y is either another block or a slot). "place X on Y" means the agent places the block X onto Y (Y is either another block or a slot). Every pick is allowed only for the appropriate agent (vowel_agent for vowels A/E/I, consonant_agent for consonants B/C/D/F/G) and only top blocks are manipulated. The sequence respects the single-hold constraint (each agent holds at most one block at a time) and the <=3 stacks invariant.

t=0 — vowel_agent: pick-vowel-from-block(vowel_agent, A, B)
- vowel_agent picks up block A from on top of block B.

t=1 — vowel_agent: place-vowel-on-slot(vowel_agent, A, slot3)
- vowel_agent places held block A onto slot3 (creating/using the free table slot3).

t=2 — consonant_agent: pick-consonant-from-block(consonant_agent, B, C)
- consonant_agent picks up block B from on top of block C.

t=3 — consonant_agent: place-consonant-on-block(consonant_agent, B, A)
- consonant_agent places held block B on top of block A (A currently on slot3).

t=4 — consonant_agent: pick-consonant-from-block(consonant_agent, C, D)
- consonant_agent picks up block C from on top of block D.

t=5 — consonant_agent: place-consonant-on-block(consonant_agent, C, F)
- consonant_agent places held block C on top of block F.

t=6 — consonant_agent: pick-consonant-from-slot(consonant_agent, D, slot1)

t=7 — consonant_agent: place-consonant-on-block(consonant_agent, D, B)
- consonant_agent places held block D on top of block B.

t=8 — consonant_agent: pick-consonant-from-block(consonant_agent, C, F)
- consonant_agent picks up block C from on top of block F.

t=9 — consonant_agent: place-consonant-on-block(consonant_agent, C, D)
- consonant_agent places held block C on top of block D.

t=10 — consonant_agent: pick-consonant-from-block(consonant_agent, F, I)
- consonant_agent picks up block F from on top of block I.

t=11 — consonant_agent: place-consonant-on-slot(consonant_agent, F, slot1)
- consonant_agent places held block F onto slot1 (now F at bottom of slot1).

t=12 — consonant_agent: pick-consonant-from-block(consonant_agent, C, D)
- consonant_agent picks up block C from on top of block D.

t=13 — consonant_agent: place-consonant-on-block(consonant_agent, C, F)
- consonant_agent places held block C on top of block F.

t=14 — vowel_agent: pick-vowel-from-block(vowel_agent, I, G)
- vowel_agent picks up block I (a vowel) from on top of block G.

t=15 — vowel_agent: place-vowel-on-block(vowel_agent, I, C)
- vowel_agent places held block I on top of block C.

t=16 — consonant_agent: pick-consonant-from-block(consonant_agent, G, E)
- consonant_agent picks up block G from on top of block E.

t=17 — consonant_agent: place-consonant-on-block(consonant_agent, G, I)
- consonant_agent places held block G on top of block I.

t=18 — consonant_agent: pick-consonant-from-block(consonant_agent, D, B)
- consonant_agent picks up block D from on top of block B.

t=19 — consonant_agent: place-consonant-on-block(consonant_agent, D, G)
- consonant_agent places held block D on top of block G.

t=20 — vowel_agent: pick-vowel-from-slot(vowel_agent, E, slot2)
- vowel_agent picks up block E from slot2 (E was on slot2).

t=21 — vowel_agent: place-vowel-on-block(vowel_agent, E, D)
- vowel_agent places held block E on top of block D.

t=22 — consonant_agent: pick-consonant-from-block(consonant_agent, B, A)
- consonant_agent picks up block B from on top of block A (A on slot3).

t=23 — consonant_agent: place-consonant-on-block(consonant_agent, B, E)
- consonant_agent places held block B on top of block E.

t=24 — vowel_agent: pick-vowel-from-slot(vowel_agent, A, slot3)
- vowel_agent picks up block A from slot3.

t=25 — vowel_agent: place-vowel-on-slot(vowel_agent, A, slot2)
- vowel_agent places held block A onto slot2 (now A is the bottom of slot2 stack).

t=26 — consonant_agent: pick-consonant-from-block(consonant_agent, B, E)
- consonant_agent picks up block B from on top of block E.

t=27 — consonant_agent: place-consonant-on-block(consonant_agent, B, A)
- consonant_agent places held block B on top of block A.

t=28 — vowel_agent: pick-vowel-from-block(vowel_agent, E, D)
- vowel_agent picks up block E from on top of block D.

t=29 — vowel_agent: place-vowel-on-slot(vowel_agent, E, slot3)
- vowel_agent places held block E onto slot3 (making slot3 non-free again).

t=30 — consonant_agent: pick-consonant-from-block(consonant_agent, D, G)
- consonant_agent picks up block D from on top of block G.

t=31 — consonant_agent: place-consonant-on-block(consonant_agent, D, B)
- consonant_agent places held block D on top of block B.

t=32 — vowel_agent: pick-vowel-from-slot(vowel_agent, E, slot3)
- vowel_agent picks up block E from slot3.

t=33 — vowel_agent: place-vowel-on-block(vowel_agent, E, D)
- vowel_agent places held block E on top of block D.

Final result after t=33:
- Stack on slot1 (bottom->top): F, C, I, G  (matches goal_stack1)
- Stack on slot2 (bottom->top): A, B, D, E  (matches goal_stack2)
- slot3 is free (if intermediate manipulations left it free earlier; final state in actions places E onto D at t=33, so slot3 is empty) — overall the arrangement matches the specified goal.

This sequence follows the provided PDDL plan exactly, with each action performed by the agent named in the plan, and respects agent constraints (vowel_agent manipulates A/E/I only; consonant_agent manipulates B/C/D/F/G only), single-block holds, and top-only pickups.
