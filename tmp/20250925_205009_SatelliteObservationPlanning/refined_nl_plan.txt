Below is a human-readable, step-by-step rendering of the provided PDDL plan. Actions are listed in the same order as the plan; no actions were added or removed. I give a simple timestamp for each step (starting at t=0) and a brief statement of the action and its immediate intended effect per the domain semantics.

t=0 — switch-on(satellite9, instrument22)
- Satellite9 turns instrument22 on. Power on satellite9 is consumed; instrument22 becomes on and its calibration is cleared.

- Satellite9 slews (points) from Planet11 to GroundStation1.

t=2 — switch-on(satellite8, instrument19)
- Satellite8 turns instrument19 on. Power on satellite8 is consumed; instrument19 becomes on and its calibration is cleared.

t=3 — turn(satellite8, GroundStation4, Star2)
- Satellite8 slews from GroundStation4 to Star2.

t=4 — switch-on(satellite6, instrument15)
- Satellite6 turns instrument15 on. Power on satellite6 is consumed; instrument15 becomes on and its calibration is cleared.
