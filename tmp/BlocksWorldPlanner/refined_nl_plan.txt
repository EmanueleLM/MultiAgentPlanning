Here is a human‐readable, step‐by‐step execution of the given plan.  Each action is stamped in time (assuming each takes 1 time unit):

Step 1 (time 0 → 1; duration=1)  
  Action: pick up block A from the table.  
  Preconditions:  
    – Block A is on the table.  
    – Block A is clear.  
  Effects:  
    – The agent is now holding A.  
    – A is no longer on the table.  
    – A is no longer clear.

Step 2 (time 1 → 2; duration=1)  
  Action: stack block A onto block B.  
  Preconditions:  
    – The agent is holding A.  
    – Block B is clear.  
  Effects:  
    – Block A is placed on block B.  
    – A becomes clear.  
    – B is no longer clear.  
    – The agent is no longer holding A.

After these two steps, the goal condition “A on B” is achieved.
