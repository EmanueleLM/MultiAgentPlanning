Here is a set of human-readable actions that describe the provided PDDL plan:

1. **Action: Travel**
   - **Participants**: James
   - **From**: Alamo Square
   - **To**: Marina District
   - **Current Time**: 9:00 AM
   - **This step essentially accounts for James already being at the Marina District by starting at 9:00 AM, as there is no travel duration incurred at this point.**

2. **Action: Meet**
   - **Participants**: Visitor and James
   - **Location**: Marina District
   - **Start Time**: 9:00 AM
   - **End Time**: 8:00 PM
   - **Duration**: 11 hours
   - **Objective**: This action ensures that the Visitor and James meet at the Marina District for the maximum possible duration within the available timeframe.

- **Note**: While the outcome stems from an abstract PDDL action plan, the translation respects each specified step within the plan and is compliant with the goals and constraints laid out; i.e., allowing the Visitor to meet James for as long as possible in the given time window.
