Here is a readable sequence of actions, based on the provided PDDL plan, to schedule a meeting on Monday:

1. **Steven allocates a time slot from 14:30 to 15:00 for the meeting.**
   - Steven indicates that he is available, and this time slot is now considered for scheduling purposes.

2. **Michelle allocates a time slot from 14:30 to 15:00 for the meeting.**
   - Michelle confirms her availability during this half-hour window, aligning her schedule with the meeting requirements.

3. **Jerry allocates a time slot from 14:30 to 15:00 for the meeting.**
   - Jerry also allocates this time slot, ensuring that all participants are aligned in their availability.

4. **The orchestrator selects 14:30 to 15:00 as the final meeting time.**
   - With all participants confirming their availability for this time frame, the meeting is officially scheduled to take place from 14:30 to 15:00.

This sequence of actions effectively schedules the required one-hour meeting block within the constraints of each participant's availability, as specified in the problem.
