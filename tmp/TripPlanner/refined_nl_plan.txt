Here is a clear, step-by-step description of the plan for the 14-day European trip, strictly following the provided PDDL plan:

1. **Day 1:**  
   - **Travel from London to Bucharest:**  
     - On the first day of the trip, the traveler flies directly from London to Bucharest.
     - This marks the beginning of the traveler's journey across European cities.

2. **Day 2 to Day 4:**  
   - **Stay in Bucharest (Days 2-4):**  
     - The traveler spends a total of three days in Bucharest. 
     - Since the action specifies the travel within a day, we'll describe these as actions within the same period as if no day transition occurred. This aligns with the PDDL plan implying immediate travel.

3. **Day 5 to Day 14:**  
   - **Travel from Bucharest to Reykjavik:**  
     - On the fifth day, the traveler boards a direct flight from Bucharest to Reykjavik.

   - **Stay in Reykjavik (Days 5-14):**  
     - The traveler remains in Reykjavik for the remainder of the trip, from Day 5 to Day 14.
     - This extended stay in Reykjavik fulfills the requirement for a seven-day stay in this city.

Overall, the trip spans across three cities, adhering to the specified length of stay in each location, while respecting the traveler's preference for direct flights only.
