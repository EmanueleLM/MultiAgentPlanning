Produce a PDDL domain and a PDDL problem that model the integrated multi-agent block rearrangement task. Ensure actions are clearly assigned to the appropriate agent (vowel_agent or consonant_agent). Encode constraints: top-only moves, single-block holding per agent, agent-specific block access, max 3 table stacks, cannot place on a block held by the other agent, and only single-block moves. Keep concurrency possible by modeling which actions may be simultaneous but do not include execution schedules. Return only the PDDL domain and problem files enclosed between <domain></domain> and <problem></problem> tags.",
