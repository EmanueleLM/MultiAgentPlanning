To achieve the task specified in the PDDL domain and problem, the following series of actions need to be performed:

1. **Action**: Find the key  
   **Agent**: Small Robot  
   **Description**: The small robot searches for and successfully locates a key. Although initially presumed not to have a key, it manages to obtain one.  
   **Timestamp/Duration**: Instantaneous, as it represents a planned and assumed state in the simulation.

2. **Action**: Open the vault  
   **Agent**: Small Robot  
   **Location**: Vault1  
   **Description**: Now equipped with a key, the small robot proceeds to the vault (vault1) and opens it. This action accomplishes two major conditions: the vault is no longer closed, and it is now open. The small robot is one of the few capable of entering the vault due to its size compatibility.  
   **Timestamp/Duration**: Takes place immediately after finding the key.

3. **Action**: Grab the object  
   **Agent**: Key Holder  
   **Location**: Vault1  
   **Object**: Object1  
   **Description**: With the vault open, the key holder, a larger robot with enhanced capabilities, moves into position and retrieves the object (object1) from within the vault. The robot confirms possession of the object.  
   **Timestamp/Duration**: Immediately follows the opening of the vault.

4. **Action**: Retrieve the object  
   **Agent**: Key Holder  
   **Object**: Object1  
   **Description**: The object is securely retrieved from the area, meeting the overall mission objective. The completion of this task is marked by the confirmation that the object is successfully out of the vault and secured.  
   **Timestamp/Duration**: Completes the sequence of actions.

By following the specific plan provided, the goal of opening the vault and retrieving the object inside is successfully accomplished.
