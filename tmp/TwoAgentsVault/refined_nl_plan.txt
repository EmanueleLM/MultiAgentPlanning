Here is the plan to open the vault and retrieve the object inside, based on the given PDDL plan:

1. **Big Robot Uses the Key**
   - **Timestamp**: T0
   - **Action**: The **key_holder** (big-robot1) utilizes its key to open the vault.
   - **Details**: This action is possible because the key_holder is a big robot with the key. When the key_holder uses the key, the vault transitions from being closed to open.
   - **Duration**: Instantaneous

2. **Small Robot Retrieves the Object**
   - **Timestamp**: T1
   - **Action**: The **small_robot** (small-robot1) enters the now open vault and retrieves the object located inside.
   - **Details**: The small_robot can access the vault because it is small and capable of fitting into the restricted entrance. This action retrieves the object, completing the task.
   - **Duration**: Instantaneous

This two-step plan successfully opens the vault using the big robot's key and allows the small robot to grab the object inside, achieving the final goal of retrieving the object.
