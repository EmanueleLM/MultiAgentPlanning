Here is the human-readable set of actions based on the provided PDDL plan:

**Goal:** Rearrange the blocks to have Block A on the table, Block B on the table, Block O on top of Block B, and Block C on top of Block O.

---

**Current time: 00:00:00 - Initial State:**
*   Block B is on Block A.
*   Block A is on the table.
*   Block C is on the table.
*   Block O is on the table.
*   Both the `vowel_agent` and `consonant_agent` have empty hands.

---

**Plan Execution:**

**Step 1 (at 00:00:00):**
The `consonant_agent` unstacks block `B` from on top of block `A`.
*   **Result:** The `consonant_agent` is now holding block `B`. Block `A` is left clear on the table.

**Step 2 (at 00:00:05):**
The `vowel_agent` picks up block `O` from the table.
*   **Result:** The `vowel_agent` is now holding block `O`.

**Step 3 (at 00:00:10):**
The `vowel_agent` stacks block `O` onto block `B`.
*   **Result:** The `vowel_agent` no longer holds block `O` and now has an empty hand. Block `O` is now placed on top of block `B`.

**Step 4 (at 00:00:15):**
The `consonant_agent` puts down block `B` onto the table.
*   **Result:** The `consonant_agent` no longer holds block `B` and now has an empty hand. The stack (O on B) is now on the table, with B on the table and O on B. Block C is still on the table.

**Step 5 (at 00:00:20):**
The `consonant_agent` picks up block `C` from the table.
*   **Result:** The `consonant_agent` is now holding block `C`.

**Step 6 (at 00:00:25):**
The `consonant_agent` stacks block `C` onto block `O`.
*   **Result:** The `consonant_agent` no longer holds block `C` and now has an empty hand. Block `C` is now placed on top of block `O`.

---

**Final State:**
*   Block A is on the table.
*   Block B is on the table.
*   Block O is on top of Block B.
*   Block C is on top of Block O.
This matches the target configuration.
