Here is the sequence of actions performed by the agents to achieve the goal:

1. **Timestamp: 0.000**
   - **Agent:** Consonant Agent
   - **Action:** Pick up block C
   - **Duration:** 0.001 seconds
   - **Description:** The consonant agent picks up block C, which is initially clear and on the table.

2. **Timestamp: 0.000**
   - **Agent:** Vowel Agent
   - **Action:** Pick up block O
   - **Duration:** 0.001 seconds
   - **Description:** Simultaneously, the vowel agent picks up block O, which is also initially clear and on the table.

3. **Timestamp: 0.001**
   - **Agent:** Vowel Agent
   - **Action:** Stack block O onto block B
   - **Duration:** 0.001 seconds
   - **Description:** The vowel agent places block O on top of block B, which is clear on the table.

4. **Timestamp: 0.002**
   - **Agent:** Consonant Agent
   - **Action:** Stack block C onto block O
   - **Duration:** 0.001 seconds
   - **Description:** The consonant agent stacks block C on top of block O, now completing the desired configuration with C on top of O and O on top of B.

These steps achieve the target configuration: block A and B remain on the table, block C is stacked on O, and block O is stacked on B, fulfilling the agents' shared goal.
