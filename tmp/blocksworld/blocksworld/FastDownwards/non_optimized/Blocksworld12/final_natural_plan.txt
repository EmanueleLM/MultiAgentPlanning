Plan summary: 32 actions, each executed sequentially (unit duration). Start time = 0.0, each action duration = 1.0, so step n runs from time (n-1).0 to n.0. All actions follow the given plan exactly and respect agent capabilities (vowel_agent moves vowels A,E,I; consonant_agent moves consonants B,C,D,F,G,H,J).

Step-by-step actions:

1) t=0.0 → 1.0 (duration 1.0) — consonant_agent: Move block B from on top of G to on top of C.
2) t=1.0 → 2.0 — consonant_agent: Move block G from on top of I to the table.
3) t=2.0 → 3.0 — vowel_agent: Move block I from on top of F to the table.
4) t=3.0 → 4.0 — consonant_agent: Move block F from on top of E to on top of G.
5) t=4.0 → 5.0 — vowel_agent: Move block E from on top of J to on top of F.
6) t=5.0 → 6.0 — vowel_agent: Move block I from the table to on top of J.
7) t=6.0 → 7.0 — consonant_agent: Move block B from on top of C to the table.
8) t=7.0 → 8.0 — consonant_agent: Move block C from on top of A to the table.
9) t=8.0 → 9.0 — vowel_agent: Move block A from on top of D to on top of B.
10) t=9.0 → 10.0 — consonant_agent: Move block D from on top of H to on top of E.
11) t=10.0 → 11.0 — consonant_agent: Move block H from the table to on top of I.
12) t=11.0 → 12.0 — consonant_agent: Move block D from on top of E to the table.
13) t=12.0 → 13.0 — consonant_agent: Move block C from the table to on top of D.
14) t=13.0 → 14.0 — vowel_agent: Move block A from on top of B to the table.
15) t=14.0 → 15.0 — consonant_agent: Move block B from the table to on top of C.
16) t=15.0 → 16.0 — vowel_agent: Move block A from the table to on top of B.
17) t=16.0 → 17.0 — vowel_agent: Move block E from on top of F to the table.
18) t=17.0 → 18.0 — consonant_agent: Move block F from on top of G to the table.
19) t=18.0 → 19.0 — vowel_agent: Move block E from the table to on top of F.
20) t=19.0 → 20.0 — consonant_agent: Move block G from the table to on top of H.
21) t=20.0 → 21.0 — vowel_agent: Move block E from on top of F to the table.
22) t=21.0 → 22.0 — consonant_agent: Move block F from the table to on top of G.
23) t=22.0 → 23.0 — vowel_agent: Move block E from the table to on top of F.
24) t=23.0 → 24.0 — vowel_agent: Move block A from on top of B to the table.
25) t=24.0 → 25.0 — consonant_agent: Move block B from on top of C to the table.
26) t=25.0 → 26.0 — vowel_agent: Move block A from the table to on top of B.
27) t=26.0 → 27.0 — consonant_agent: Move block C from on top of D to the table.
28) t=27.0 → 28.0 — consonant_agent: Move block D from the table to on top of E.
29) t=28.0 → 29.0 — consonant_agent: Move block C from the table to on top of D.
30) t=29.0 → 30.0 — vowel_agent: Move block A from on top of B to the table.
31) t=30.0 → 31.0 — consonant_agent: Move block B from the table to on top of C.
32) t=31.0 → 32.0 — vowel_agent: Move block A from the table to on top of B.

Final state (goal achieved): single stack with J on the table, then I, then H, then G, then F, then E, then D, then C, then B, then A on top — exactly the specified target configuration. Total cost: 32 (unit cost per action).
