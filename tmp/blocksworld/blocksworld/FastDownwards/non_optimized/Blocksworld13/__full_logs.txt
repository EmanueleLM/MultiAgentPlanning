PROBLEM
------------------------------
Two agents are tasked with manipulating blocks arranged in stacks on a table, from one configuration to another. Each block is uniquely labelled by a letter. Both agents can only interact with blocks at the top of each stack, and only interact with one block at a time. Additionally, one agent can only interact with vowel blocks, and the other can only interact with consonant blocks. Initially there are blocks L, J, H, I, G, K, B, E, F, C, D, A. L is on the table, J is on the table, H is on top of L, I is on the table, G is on top of H, K is on top of J, B is on top of I, E is on top of B, F is on top of E, C is on top of K, D is on top of C, A is on top of G. The goal is to have A is on top of B, B is on top of C, C is on top of D, D is on top of E, E is on top of F, F is on top of G, G is on top of H, H is on top of I, I is on top of J, J is on top of K, K is on top of L, L is on the table.

Both agents can only interact with blocks at the top of each stack, and only interact with one block at a time. Additionally, one agent can only interact with vowel blocks, and the other can only interact with consonant blocks. Initially there are blocks L, J, H, I, G, K, B, E, F, C, D, A. L is on the table, J is on the table, H is on top of L, I is on the table, G is on top of H, K is on top of J, B is on top of I, E is on top of B, F is on top of E, C is on top of K, D is on top of C, A is on top of G. The goal is to have A is on top of B, B is on top of C, C is on top of D, D is on top of E, E is on top of F, F is on top of G, G is on top of H, H is on top of I, I is on top of J, J is on top of K, K is on top of L, L is on the table.",

NATURAL-PLAN sas_plan_5
------------------------------
Below is a human-readable, step-by-step trace of the provided plan. Each step matches exactly one action in the plan (same order, same agent, same parameters). I show a timestamp for each action, assuming each action takes 1 second (start t=00:00:00). Block labels are shown in uppercase to match the problem specification.

Total actions: 51. Total assumed duration: 51 seconds.

00:00:00 — Step 01: vowel_agent moves block A from G onto A.
00:00:01 — Step 02: consonant_agent moves block D from C onto D.
00:00:02 — Step 03: consonant_agent moves block C from K onto D.
00:00:03 — Step 04: consonant_agent moves block F from E onto G.
00:00:04 — Step 05: vowel_agent moves block E from B onto F.
00:00:05 — Step 06: consonant_agent moves block B from I onto C.
00:00:06 — Step 07: vowel_agent moves block A from A onto B.
00:00:07 — Step 08: consonant_agent moves block K from J onto K.
00:00:08 — Step 09: consonant_agent moves block J from the table onto K.

PROBLEM
------------------------------
Two agents are tasked with manipulating blocks arranged in stacks on a table, from one configuration to another. Each block is uniquely labelled by a letter. Both agents can only interact with blocks at the top of each stack, and only interact with one block at a time. Additionally, one agent can only interact with vowel blocks, and the other can only interact with consonant blocks. Initially there are blocks M, C, B, G, E, N, J, L, F, I, K, D, A, H. M is on the table, C is on the table, B is on top of C, G is on top of B, E is on top of M, N is on top of E, J is on top of G, L is on top of N, F is on top of L, I is on top of J, K is on top of F, D is on top of I, A is on top of D, H is on top of A. The goal is to have A is on top of B, B is on top of C, C is on top of D, D is on top of E, E is on top of F, F is on top of G, G is on top of H, H is on top of I, I is on top of J, J is on top of K, K is on top of L, L is on top of M, M is on top of N, N is on the table.

Additionally, one agent can only interact with vowel blocks, and the other can only interact with consonant blocks. Initially there are blocks M, C, B, G, E, N, J, L, F, I, K, D, A, H. M is on the table, C is on the table, B is on top of C, G is on top of B, E is on top of M, N is on top of E, J is on top of G, L is on top of N, F is on top of L, I is on top of J, K is on top of F, D is on top of I, A is on top of D, H is on top of A.

Both agents can only interact with blocks at the top of each stack, and only interact with one block at a time. Additionally, one agent can only interact with vowel blocks, and the other can only interact with consonant blocks. Initially there are blocks M, C, B, G, E, N, J, L, F, I, K, D, A, H. M is on the table, C is on the table, B is on top of C, G is on top of B, E is on top of M, N is on top of E, J is on top of G, L is on top of N, F is on top of L, I is on top of J, K is on top of F, D is on top of I, A is on top of D, H is on top of A. The goal is to have A is on top of B, B is on top of C, C is on top of D, D is on top of E, E is on top of F, F is on top of G, G is on top of H, H is on top of I, I is on top of J, J is on top of K, K is on top of L, L is on top of M, M is on top of N, N is on the table.",

Both agents can only interact with blocks at the top of each stack, and only interact with one block at a time. Additionally, one agent can only interact with vowel blocks, and the other can only interact with consonant blocks. Initially there are blocks M, C, B, G, E, N, J, L, F, I, K, D, A, H. M is on the table, C is on the table, B is on top of C, G is on top of B, E is on top of M, N is on top of E, J is on top of G, L is on top of N, F is on top of L, I is on top of J, K is on top of F, D is on top of I, A is on top of D, H is on top of A. The goal is to have A is on top of B, B is on top of C, C is on top of D, D is on top of E, E is on top of F, F is on top of G, G is on top of H, H is on top of I, I is on top of J, J is on top of K, K is on top of L, L is on top of M, M is on top of N, N is on the table.",

Both agents can only interact with blocks at the top of each stack, and only interact with one block at a time. Additionally, one agent can only interact with vowel blocks, and the other can only interact with consonant blocks. Initially there are blocks M, C, B, G, E, N, J, L, F, I, K, D, A, H. M is on the table, C is on the table, B is on top of C, G is on top of B, E is on top of M, N is on top of E, J is on top of G, L is on top of N, F is on top of L, I is on top of J, K is on top of F, D is on top of I, A is on top of D, H is on top of A. The goal is to have A is on top of B, B is on top of C, C is on top of D, D is on top of E, E is on top of F, F is on top of G, G is on top of H, H is on top of I, I is on top of J, J is on top of K, K is on top of L, L is on top of M, M is on top of N, N is on the table.",

PROBLEM
------------------------------
Two agents are tasked with manipulating blocks arranged in stacks on a table, from one configuration to another. Each block is uniquely labelled by a letter. Both agents can only interact with blocks at the top of each stack, and only interact with one block at a time. Additionally, one agent can only interact with vowel blocks, and the other can only interact with consonant blocks. Initially there are blocks L, F, K, C, G, H, D, B, J, E, I, A. L is on the table, F is on top of L, K is on the table, C is on top of F, G is on the table, H is on top of K, D is on top of H, B is on top of D, J is on top of B, E is on top of J, I is on the table, A is on top of I. The goal is to have A is on top of B, B is on top of C, C is on top of D, D is on top of E, E is on top of F, F is on top of G, G is on top of H, H is on top of I, I is on top of J, J is on top of K, K is on top of L, L is on the table.

Both agents can only interact with blocks at the top of each stack, and only interact with one block at a time. Additionally, one agent can only interact with vowel blocks, and the other can only interact with consonant blocks. Initially there are blocks L, F, K, C, G, H, D, B, J, E, I, A. L is on the table, F is on top of L, K is on the table, C is on top of F, G is on the table, H is on top of K, D is on top of H, B is on top of D, J is on top of B, E is on top of J, I is on the table, A is on top of I. The goal is to have A is on top of B, B is on top of C, C is on top of D, D is on top of E, E is on top of F, F is on top of G, G is on top of H, H is on top of I, I is on top of J, J is on top of K, K is on top of L, L is on the table.",

    "human_specification": "Two agents are tasked with manipulating blocks arranged in stacks on a table, from one configuration to another. Each block is uniquely labelled by a letter. Both agents can only interact with blocks at the top of each stack, and only interact with one block at a time. Additionally, one agent can only interact with vowel blocks, and the other can only interact with consonant blocks. Initially there are blocks L, F, K, C, G, H, D, B, J, E, I, A. L is on the table, F is on top of L, K is on the table, C is on top of F, G is on the table, H is on top of K, D is on top of H, B is on top of D, J is on top of B, E is on top of J, I is on the table, A is on top of I. The goal is to have A is on top of B, B is on top of C, C is on top of D, D is on top of E, E is on top of F, F is on top of G, G is on top of H, H is on top of I, I is on top of J, J is on top of K, K is on top of L, L is on the table.",

Both agents can only interact with blocks at the top of each stack, and only interact with one block at a time. Additionally, one agent can only interact with vowel blocks, and the other can only interact with consonant blocks. Initially there are blocks L, F, K, C, G, H, D, B, J, E, I, A. L is on the table, F is on top of L, K is on the table, C is on top of F, G is on the table, H is on top of K, D is on top of H, B is on top of D, J is on top of B, E is on top of J, I is on the table, A is on top of I. The goal is to have A is on top of B, B is on top of C, C is on top of D, D is on top of E, E is on top of F, F is on top of G, G is on top of H, H is on top of I, I is on top of J, J is on top of K, K is on top of L, L is on the table.",

You will receive their PDDL domains and problems. You have to integrate them to solve the following task: {agents->orchestrator->goal} Keep in mind that the PDDL you receive may be partial or contain ambiguities. A partial PDDL may partially solve a planning problem but may require integrating additional information from the other PDDL to achieve the goal. Ambiguities may appear in different forms for example two PDDL problems may refer to the same object with different names. Here is the information the first agent has and its PDDL response: {pddl_vowel_agent} Here is the information the second agent has and its PDDL response: {pddl_consonant_agent} You need to integrate the PDDL responses of the two agents to solve the task. It is important that you keep the actions of the two agents distinct. Think step by step and provide a combined PDDL domain and a PDDL problem file suitable for FastDownwards. Enclose the PDDL domain between <domain></domain> tags and the PDDL problem between <problem></problem> tags."

PROBLEM
------------------------------
Two agents are tasked with manipulating blocks arranged in stacks on a table, from one configuration to another. Each block is uniquely labelled by a letter. Both agents can only interact with blocks at the top of each stack, and only interact with one block at a time. Additionally, one agent can only interact with vowel blocks, and the other can only interact with consonant blocks. Initially there are blocks C, B, I, F, D, A, E, G, H, J. C is on the table, B is on the table, I is on top of C, F is on top of I, D is on top of B, A is on top of D, E is on top of A, G is on top of E, H is on top of G, J is on top of F. The goal is to have A is on top of B, B is on top of C, C is on top of D, D is on top of E, E is on top of F, F is on top of G, G is on top of H, H is on top of I, I is on top of J, J is on the table.

Both agents can only interact with blocks at the top of each stack, and only interact with one block at a time.

Both agents can only interact with blocks at the top of each stack, and only interact with one block at a time. Additionally, one agent can only interact with vowel blocks, and the other can only interact with consonant blocks. Initially there are blocks C, B, I, F, D, A, E, G, H, J. C is on the table, B is on the table, I is on top of C, F is on top of I, D is on top of B, A is on top of D, E is on top of A, G is on top of E, H is on top of G, J is on top of F. The goal is to have A is on top of B, B is on top of C, C is on top of D, D is on top of E, E is on top of F, F is on top of G, G is on top of H, H is on top of I, I is on top of J, J is on the table.",

Both agents can only interact with blocks at the top of each stack, and only interact with one block at a time. Additionally, one agent can only interact with vowel blocks, and the other can only interact with consonant blocks. Initially there are blocks C, B, I, F, D, A, E, G, H, J. C is on the table, B is on the table, I is on top of C, F is on top of I, D is on top of B, A is on top of D, E is on top of A, G is on top of E, H is on top of G, J is on top of F.

Both agents can only interact with blocks at the top of each stack, and only interact with one block at a time. Additionally, one agent can only interact with vowel blocks, and the other can only interact with consonant blocks. Initially there are blocks C, B, I, F, D, A, E, G, H, J. C is on the table, B is on the table, I is on top of C, F is on top of I, D is on top of B, A is on top of D, E is on top of A, G is on top of E, H is on top of G, J is on top of F. The goal is to have A is on top of B, B is on top of C, C is on top of D, D is on top of E, E is on top of F, F is on top of G, G is on top of H, H is on top of I, I is on top of J, J is on the table.",

NATURAL-PLAN sas_plan_5
------------------------------
Below is a step-by-step, human-readable rendition of the provided PDDL plan. Each step exactly matches one action from the plan in order, identifies the agent performing it (consonant_agent or vowel_agent), gives a short plain-English description of the operation, reports a timestamp (starting at t=0s) and a duration of 1s per action, and states the immediate effect on the blocks involved.

Summary assumptions:
- Time starts at t = 0s; each action takes 1s (so step N occurs at t = N-1 s and completes at t = N s).
- Block labels are shown uppercase for readability (plan used lowercase); e.g., a -> A, b -> B, etc.
- "Unstack X from Y" means X was on Y; agent picks up X and Y becomes clear.
- "Pickup-from-table X" means agent picks X up from the table.
- "Putdown-to-table X" means agent puts X down onto the table (X becomes ontable and clear).
- "Stack X onto Y" means agent places X on top of Y (Y is no longer clear).

- F on G
- G on H
- H on I
- I on J
- J on the table

Goal achieved at t = 58s. Total actions: 58 (unit cost each) — total cost = 58.

If you want, I can (1) display the intermediate stack configuration after each step, (2) verify agent constraints against the original JSON spec (which lists vowels as A and E) and highlight any mismatches, or (3) produce a compact timeline grouped by agent concurrency assumptions. Which would you prefer next?
================================================================================

PROBLEM
------------------------------
Two agents are tasked with manipulating blocks arranged in stacks on a table, from one configuration to another. Each block is uniquely labelled by a letter. Both agents can only interact with blocks at the top of each stack, and only interact with one block at a time. Additionally, one agent can only interact with vowel blocks, and the other can only interact with consonant blocks. Initially there are blocks D, A, K, J, C, F, G, I, E, H, B. D is on the table, A is on the table, K is on top of D, J is on the table, C is on top of J, F is on top of C, G is on top of F, I is on the table, E is on top of I, H is on top of K, B is on top of A. The goal is to have A is on top of B, B is on top of C, C is on top of D, D is on top of E, E is on top of F, F is on top of G, G is on top of H, H is on top of I, I is on top of J, J is on top of K, K is on the table.

Here is the information the first agent has and its PDDL response: {pddl_vowel_agent} Here is the information the second agent has and its PDDL response: {pddl_consonant_agent} You need to integrate the PDDL responses of the two agents to solve the task. It is very important that you keep the actions of the two agents distinct and that the final PDDL targets the FastDownward solver. Think step by step and provide a PDDL domain and a PDDL problem file. Enclose the PDDL domain between <domain></domain> tags and the PDDL problem between <problem></problem> tags."

    "human_specification": "Two agents are tasked with manipulating blocks arranged in stacks on a table, from one configuration to another. Each block is uniquely labelled by a letter. Both agents can only interact with blocks at the top of each stack, and only interact with one block at a time. Additionally, one agent can only interact with vowel blocks, and the other can only interact with consonant blocks. Initially there are blocks D, A, K, J, C, F, G, I, E, H, B. D is on the table, A is on the table, K is on top of D, J is on the table, C is on top of J, F is on top of C, G is on top of F, I is on the table, E is on top of I, H is on top of K, B is on top of A. The goal is to have A is on top of B, B is on top of C, C is on top of D, D is on top of E, E is on top of F, F is on top of G, G is on top of H, H is on top of I, I is on top of J, J is on top of K, K is on the table.",

If there are multiple agents, you keep their actions distinct and preserve each agent's action constraints (vowels vs consonants). You must integrate partial or ambiguous PDDL inputs from agents into a unified multi-agent PDDL that keeps actions distinct.",

You have to orchestrate them to solve the following task: {agents->orchestrator->goal} Keep in mind that the PDDL they send you may be partial or contain ambiguities. A partial PDDL may partially solve a planning problem but may require integrating additional information from the other PDDL to achieve the goal. Ambiguities may appear in different forms for example two PDDL problems may refer to the same object with different names. Here is the information the first agent has and its PDDL response: {pddl_vowel_agent} Here is the information the second agent has and its PDDL response: {pddl_consonant_agent} You need to integrate the PDDL responses of the two agents to solve the task. It is very important that you keep the actions of the two agents distinct and that the final PDDL targets the FastDownward solver. Think step by step and provide a PDDL domain and a PDDL problem file. Enclose the PDDL domain between <domain></domain> tags and the PDDL problem between <problem></problem> tags."

Both agents can only interact with blocks at the top of each stack, and only interact with one block at a time. Additionally, one agent can only interact with vowel blocks, and the other can only interact with consonant blocks. Initially there are blocks D, A, K, J, C, F, G, I, E, H, B. D is on the table, A is on the table, K is on top of D, J is on the table, C is on top of J, F is on top of C, G is on top of F, I is on the table, E is on top of I, H is on top of K, B is on top of A. The goal is to have A is on top of B, B is on top of C, C is on top of D, D is on top of E, E is on top of F, F is on top of G, G is on top of H, H is on top of I, I is on top of J, J is on top of K, K is on the table.",

You have to orchestrate them to solve the following task: {agents->orchestrator->goal} Keep in mind that the PDDL they send you may be partial or contain ambiguities. A partial PDDL may partially solve a planning problem but may require integrating additional information from the other PDDL to achieve the goal. Ambiguities may appear in different forms for example two PDDL problems may refer to the same object with different names. Here is the information the first agent has and its PDDL response: {pddl_vowel_agent} Here is the information the second agent has and its PDDL response: {pddl_consonant_agent} You need to integrate the PDDL responses of the two agents to solve the task. It is very important that you keep the actions of the two agents distinct and that the final PDDL targets the FastDownward solver.

Final status (after step 32): The plan completes the specified sequence of moves. Following these steps the stack order matches the provided problem goal: A on B on C on D on E on F on G on H on I on J on K, with K on the table (plan cost = 32 unit steps).

Notes:
- Each action above respects agent capabilities: vowel_agent moves only vowel-labeled blocks (A, E, I) and consonant_agent moves only consonant-labeled blocks.
- Timestamps are estimates in seconds, using 1.0s per action for readability; actual durations may differ in a real execution.

PROBLEM
------------------------------
Two agents are tasked with manipulating blocks arranged in stacks on a table, from one configuration to another. Each block is uniquely labelled by a letter. Both agents can only interact with blocks at the top of each stack, and only interact with one block at a time. Additionally, one agent can only interact with vowel blocks, and the other can only interact with consonant blocks. Initially there are blocks I, B, L, A, F, H, D, G, C, E, K, J. I is on the table, B is on the table, L is on top of I, A is on top of B, F is on top of L, H is on top of A, D is on top of H, G is on top of F, C is on top of G, E is on top of D, K is on top of E, J is on the table. The goal is to have A is on top of B, B is on top of C, C is on top of D, D is on top of E, E is on top of F, F is on top of G, G is on top of H, H is on top of I, I is on top of J, J is on top of K, K is on top of L, L is on the table.

Both agents can only interact with blocks at the top of each stack, and only interact with one block at a time. Additionally, one agent can only interact with vowel blocks, and the other can only interact with consonant blocks. Initially there are blocks I, B, L, A, F, H, D, G, C, E, K, J. I is on the table, B is on the table, L is on top of I, A is on top of B, F is on top of L, H is on top of A, D is on top of H, G is on top of F, C is on top of G, E is on top of D, K is on top of E, J is on the table. The goal is to have A is on top of B, B is on top of C, C is on top of D, D is on top of E, E is on top of F, F is on top of G, G is on top of H, H is on top of I, I is on top of J, J is on top of K, K is on top of L, L is on the table.",

Both agents can only interact with blocks at the top of each stack, and only interact with one block at a time. Additionally, one agent can only interact with vowel blocks, and the other can only interact with consonant blocks. Initially there are blocks I, B, L, A, F, H, D, G, C, E, K, J. I is on the table, B is on the table, L is on top of I, A is on top of B, F is on top of L, H is on top of A, D is on top of H, G is on top of F, C is on top of G, E is on top of D, K is on top of E, J is on the table. The goal is to have A is on top of B, B is on top of C, C is on top of D, D is on top of E, E is on top of F, F is on top of G, G is on top of H, H is on top of I, I is on top of J, J is on top of K, K is on top of L, L is on the table.",

Both agents can only interact with blocks at the top of each stack, and only interact with one block at a time. Additionally, one agent can only interact with vowel blocks, and the other can only interact with consonant blocks. Initially there are blocks I, B, L, A, F, H, D, G, C, E, K, J. I is on the table, B is on the table, L is on top of I, A is on top of B, F is on top of L, H is on top of A, D is on top of H, G is on top of F, C is on top of G, E is on top of D, K is on top of E, J is on the table. The goal is to have A is on top of B, B is on top of C, C is on top of D, D is on top of E, E is on top of F, F is on top of G, G is on top of H, H is on top of I, I is on top of J, J is on top of K, K is on top of L, L is on the table.",

Both agents can only interact with blocks at the top of each stack, and only interact with one block at a time. Additionally, one agent can only interact with vowel blocks, and the other can only interact with consonant blocks. Initially there are blocks I, B, L, A, F, H, D, G, C, E, K, J. I is on the table, B is on the table, L is on top of I, A is on top of B, F is on top of L, H is on top of A, D is on top of H, G is on top of F, C is on top of G, E is on top of D, K is on top of E, J is on the table. The goal is to have A is on top of B, B is on top of C, C is on top of D, D is on top of E, E is on top of F, F is on top of G, G is on top of H, H is on top of I, I is on top of J, J is on top of K, K is on top of L, L is on the table.",

Both agents can only interact with blocks at the top of each stack, and only interact with one block at a time. Additionally, one agent can only interact with vowel blocks, and the other can only interact with consonant blocks. Initially there are blocks I, B, L, A, F, H, D, G, C, E, K, J. I is on the table, B is on the table, L is on top of I, A is on top of B, F is on top of L, H is on top of A, D is on top of H, G is on top of F, C is on top of G, E is on top of D, K is on top of E, J is on the table. The goal is to have A is on top of B, B is on top of C, C is on top of D, D is on top of E, E is on top of F, F is on top of G, G is on top of H, H is on top of I, I is on top of J, J is on top of K, K is on top of L, L is on the table.",

NATURAL-PLAN sas_plan_5
------------------------------
Assumptions: each action takes 1.0s. Timestamps below start at t=0s and increase by 1s per action. Each step is exactly the corresponding plan action (no additions or deletions). Agents only move blocks they are allowed to (vowel_agent: A, E, I; consonant_agent: B C D F G H J K L). All moves are of top blocks, in accordance with the specification.

1. t=0s (duration 1s) — consonant_agent moves block c from on top of block g to the table.
2. t=1s — consonant_agent moves block g from on top of block f to the table.
3. t=2s — consonant_agent moves block f from on top of block l onto block g.
4. t=3s — consonant_agent moves block k from on top of block e onto block l.
5. t=4s — vowel_agent moves block e from on top of block d onto block f.
6. t=5s — consonant_agent moves block d from on top of block h onto block e.
7. t=6s — consonant_agent moves block c from the table onto block d.
8. t=7s — consonant_agent moves block h from on top of block a to the table.
9. t=8s — consonant_agent moves block j from the table onto block k.
10. t=9s — vowel_agent moves block a from on top of block b to the table.
11. t=10s — consonant_agent moves block b from the table onto block c.
12. t=11s — vowel_agent moves block a from the table onto block b.
13. t=12s — consonant_agent moves block j from on top of block k to the table.
14. t=13s — consonant_agent moves block k from on top of block l to the table.
15. t=14s — consonant_agent moves block j from the table onto block k.
16. t=15s — consonant_agent moves block l from on top of block i to the table.
17. t=16s — consonant_agent moves block j from on top of block k to the table.
18. t=17s — consonant_agent moves block k from the table onto block l.
19. t=18s — consonant_agent moves block j from the table onto block k.
20. t=19s — vowel_agent moves block i from the table onto block j.
21. t=20s — consonant_agent moves block h from the table onto block i.
22. t=21s — vowel_agent moves block a from on top of block b to the table.

PROBLEM
------------------------------
Two agents are tasked with manipulating blocks arranged in stacks on a table, from one configuration to another. Each block is uniquely labelled by a letter. Both agents can only interact with blocks at the top of each stack, and only interact with one block at a time. Additionally, one agent can only interact with vowel blocks, and the other can only interact with consonant blocks. Initially there are blocks A, C, I, D, L, K, E, H, F, G, J, B. A is on the table, C is on the table, I is on top of A, D is on top of C, L is on top of I, K is on top of L, E is on top of K, H is on top of D, F is on top of E, G is on top of H, J is on top of G, B is on top of J. The goal is to have A is on top of B, B is on top of C, C is on top of D, D is on top of E, E is on top of F, F is on top of G, G is on top of H, H is on top of I, I is on top of J, J is on top of K, K is on top of L, L is on the table.

Both agents can only interact with blocks at the top of each stack, and only interact with one block at a time. Additionally, one agent can only interact with vowel blocks, and the other can only interact with consonant blocks. Initially there are blocks A, C, I, D, L, K, E, H, F, G, J, B. A is on the table, C is on the table, I is on top of A, D is on top of C, L is on top of I, K is on top of L, E is on top of K, H is on top of D, F is on top of E, G is on top of H, J is on top of G, B is on top of J. The goal is to have A is on top of B, B is on top of C, C is on top of D, D is on top of E, E is on top of F, F is on top of G, G is on top of H, H is on top of I, I is on top of J, J is on top of K, K is on top of L, L is on the table.",

Both agents can only interact with blocks at the top of each stack, and only interact with one block at a time. Additionally, one agent can only interact with vowel blocks, and the other can only interact with consonant blocks. Initially there are blocks A, C, I, D, L, K, E, H, F, G, J, B. A is on the table, C is on the table, I is on top of A, D is on top of C, L is on top of I, K is on top of L, E is on top of K, H is on top of D, F is on top of E, G is on top of H, J is on top of G, B is on top of J. The goal is to have A is on top of B, B is on top of C, C is on top of D, D is on top of E, E is on top of F, F is on top of G, G is on top of H, H is on top of I, I is on top of J, J is on top of K, K is on top of L, L is on the table.",

Both agents can only interact with blocks at the top of each stack, and only interact with one block at a time. Additionally, one agent can only interact with vowel blocks, and the other can only interact with consonant blocks. Initially there are blocks A, C, I, D, L, K, E, H, F, G, J, B. A is on the table, C is on the table, I is on top of A, D is on top of C, L is on top of I, K is on top of L, E is on top of K, H is on top of D, F is on top of E, G is on top of H, J is on top of G, B is on top of J. The goal is to have A is on top of B, B is on top of C, C is on top of D, D is on top of E, E is on top of F, F is on top of G, G is on top of H, H is on top of I, I is on top of J, J is on top of K, K is on top of L, L is on the table.",

Both agents can only interact with blocks at the top of each stack, and only interact with one block at a time. Additionally, one agent can only interact with vowel blocks, and the other can only interact with consonant blocks. Initially there are blocks A, C, I, D, L, K, E, H, F, G, J, B. A is on the table, C is on the table, I is on top of A, D is on top of C, L is on top of I, K is on top of L, E is on top of K, H is on top of D, F is on top of E, G is on top of H, J is on top of G, B is on top of J. The goal is to have A is on top of B, B is on top of C, C is on top of D, D is on top of E, E is on top of F, F is on top of G, G is on top of H, H is on top of I, I is on top of J, J is on top of K, K is on top of L, L is on the table.",

PROBLEM
------------------------------
Two agents are tasked with manipulating blocks arranged in stacks on a table, from one configuration to another. Each block is uniquely labelled by a letter. Both agents can only interact with blocks at the top of each stack, and only interact with one block at a time. Additionally, one agent can only interact with vowel blocks, and the other can only interact with consonant blocks. Initially there are blocks H, L, B, K, C, A, J, E, I, D, G, F. H is on the table, L is on the table, B is on top of H, K is on the table, C is on top of B, A is on the table, J is on top of L, E is on top of C, I is on top of J, D is on top of K, G is on top of D, F is on top of E. The goal is to have A is on top of B, B is on top of C, C is on top of D, D is on top of E, E is on top of F, F is on top of G, G is on top of H, H is on top of I, I is on top of J, J is on top of K, K is on top of L, L is on the table.

Both agents can only interact with blocks at the top of each stack, and only interact with one block at a time. Additionally, one agent can only interact with vowel blocks, and the other can only interact with consonant blocks. Initially there are blocks H, L, B, K, C, A, J, E, I, D, G, F. H is on the table, L is on the table, B is on top of H, K is on the table, C is on top of B, A is on the table, J is on top of L, E is on top of C, I is on top of J, D is on top of K, G is on top of D, F is on top of E. The goal is to have A is on top of B, B is on top of C, C is on top of D, D is on top of E, E is on top of F, F is on top of G, G is on top of H, H is on top of I, I is on top of J, J is on top of K, K is on top of L, L is on the table.",

Both agents can only interact with blocks at the top of each stack, and only interact with one block at a time. Additionally, one agent can only interact with vowel blocks, and the other can only interact with consonant blocks. Initially there are blocks H, L, B, K, C, A, J, E, I, D, G, F. H is on the table, L is on the table, B is on top of H, K is on the table, C is on top of B, A is on the table, J is on top of L, E is on top of C, I is on top of J, D is on top of K, G is on top of D, F is on top of E.

Both agents can only interact with blocks at the top of each stack, and only interact with one block at a time. Additionally, one agent can only interact with vowel blocks, and the other can only interact with consonant blocks. Initially there are blocks H, L, B, K, C, A, J, E, I, D, G, F. H is on the table, L is on the table, B is on top of H, K is on the table, C is on top of B, A is on the table, J is on top of L, E is on top of C, I is on top of J, D is on top of K, G is on top of D, F is on top of E. The goal is to have A is on top of B, B is on top of C, C is on top of D, D is on top of E, E is on top of F, F is on top of G, G is on top of H, H is on top of I, I is on top of J, J is on top of K, K is on top of L, L is on the table.",

Both agents can only interact with blocks at the top of each stack, and only interact with one block at a time. Additionally, one agent can only interact with vowel blocks, and the other can only interact with consonant blocks. Initially there are blocks H, L, B, K, C, A, J, E, I, D, G, F. H is on the table, L is on the table, B is on top of H, K is on the table, C is on top of B, A is on the table, J is on top of L, E is on top of C, I is on top of J, D is on top of K, G is on top of D, F is on top of E.

Both agents can only interact with blocks at the top of each stack, and only interact with one block at a time. Additionally, one agent can only interact with vowel blocks, and the other can only interact with consonant blocks. Initially there are blocks H, L, B, K, C, A, J, E, I, D, G, F. H is on the table, L is on the table, B is on top of H, K is on the table, C is on top of B, A is on the table, J is on top of L, E is on top of C, I is on top of J, D is on top of K, G is on top of D, F is on top of E. The goal is to have A is on top of B, B is on top of C, C is on top of D, D is on top of E, E is on top of F, F is on top of G, G is on top of H, H is on top of I, I is on top of J, J is on top of K, K is on top of L, L is on the table.",

================================================================================

PROBLEM
------------------------------
Two agents are tasked with manipulating blocks arranged in stacks on a table, from one configuration to another. Each block is uniquely labelled by a letter. Both agents can only interact with blocks at the top of each stack, and only interact with one block at a time. Additionally, one agent can only interact with vowel blocks, and the other can only interact with consonant blocks. Initially there are blocks I, D, F, C, H, G, E, M, L, A, N, B, J, K. I is on the table, D is on the table, F is on top of D, C is on top of I, H is on top of C, G is on top of H, E is on top of F, M is on top of E, L is on top of M, A is on top of G, N is on top of A, B is on top of L, J is on top of B, K is on top of N. The goal is to have A is on top of B, B is on top of C, C is on top of D, D is on top of E, E is on top of F, F is on top of G, G is on top of H, H is on top of I, I is on top of J, J is on top of K, K is on top of L, L is on top of M, M is on top of N, N is on the table.

Both agents can only interact with blocks at the top of each stack, and only interact with one block at a time. Additionally, one agent can only interact with vowel blocks, and the other can only interact with consonant blocks. Initially there are blocks I, D, F, C, H, G, E, M, L, A, N, B, J, K. I is on the table, D is on the table, F is on top of D, C is on top of I, H is on top of C, G is on top of H, E is on top of F, M is on top of E, L is on top of M, A is on top of G, N is on top of A, B is on top of L, J is on top of B, K is on top of N. The goal is to have A is on top of B, B is on top of C, C is on top of D, D is on top of E, E is on top of F, F is on top of G, G is on top of H, H is on top of I, I is on top of J, J is on top of K, K is on top of L, L is on top of M, M is on top of N, N is on the table.",

Final note: All actions above respect the agents' manipulation constraints (vowel_agent only moved A, E, I; consonant_agent moved the other blocks). After step 70 the plan achieves the specified global goal: a single tower with N on the table and the blocks above it in the order N M L K J I H G F E D C B A (A is the topmost block).
================================================================================

PROBLEM
------------------------------
Two agents are tasked with manipulating blocks arranged in stacks on a table, from one configuration to another. Each block is uniquely labelled by a letter. Both agents can only interact with blocks at the top of each stack, and only interact with one block at a time. Additionally, one agent can only interact with vowel blocks, and the other can only interact with consonant blocks. Initially there are blocks D, A, F, L, K, N, B, H, I, M, G, E, C, J. D is on the table, A is on top of D, F is on top of A, L is on top of F, K is on top of L, N is on top of K, B is on top of N, H is on the table, I is on top of B, M is on top of H, G is on top of M, E is on top of G, C is on top of E, J is on top of C. The goal is to have A is on top of B, B is on top of C, C is on top of D, D is on top of E, E is on top of F, F is on top of G, G is on top of H, H is on top of I, I is on top of J, J is on top of K, K is on top of L, L is on top of M, M is on top of N, N is on the table.

Both agents can only interact with blocks at the top of each stack, and only interact with one block at a time. Additionally, one agent can only interact with vowel blocks, and the other can only interact with consonant blocks. Initially there are blocks D, A, F, L, K, N, B, H, I, M, G, E, C, J. D is on the table, A is on top of D, F is on top of A, L is on top of F, K is on top of L, N is on top of K, B is on top of N, H is on the table, I is on top of B, M is on top of H, G is on top of M, E is on top of G, C is on top of E, J is on top of C. The goal is to have A is on top of B, B is on top of C, C is on top of D, D is on top of E, E is on top of F, F is on top of G, G is on top of H, H is on top of I, I is on top of J, J is on top of K, K is on top of L, L is on top of M, M is on top of N, N is on the table.",

Both agents can only interact with blocks at the top of each stack, and only interact with one block at a time. Additionally, one agent can only interact with vowel blocks, and the other can only interact with consonant blocks. Initially there are blocks D, A, F, L, K, N, B, H, I, M, G, E, C, J. D is on the table, A is on top of D, F is on top of A, L is on top of F, K is on top of L, N is on top of K, B is on top of N, H is on the table, I is on top of B, M is on top of H, G is on top of M, E is on top of G, C is on top of E, J is on top of C. The goal is to have A is on top of B, B is on top of C, C is on top of D, D is on top of E, E is on top of F, F is on top of G, G is on top of H, H is on top of I, I is on top of J, J is on top of K, K is on top of L, L is on top of M, M is on top of N, N is on the table.",

Additionally, one agent can only interact with vowel blocks, and the other can only interact with consonant blocks. Initially there are blocks D, A, F, L, K, N, B, H, I, M, G, E, C, J.

A partial PDDL may partially solve a planning problem, but it may require integrating additional information from the other PDDL to achieve the goal. Ambiguities may appear in different forms: for example, two PDDL problems may refer to the same object with different names. Here is the information the first agent has and its PDDL response: {pddl_vowel_agent} Here is the information the second agent has and its PDDL response: {pddl_consonant_agent} You need to integrate the PDDL responses of the two agents to solve the task.

Both agents can only interact with blocks at the top of each stack, and only interact with one block at a time. Additionally, one agent can only interact with vowel blocks, and the other can only interact with consonant blocks. Initially there are blocks D, A, F, L, K, N, B, H, I, M, G, E, C, J. D is on the table, A is on top of D, F is on top of A, L is on top of F, K is on top of L, N is on top of K, B is on top of N, H is on the table, I is on top of B, M is on top of H, G is on top of M, E is on top of G, C is on top of E, J is on top of C. The goal is to have A is on top of B, B is on top of C, C is on top of D, D is on top of E, E is on top of F, F is on top of G, G is on top of H, H is on top of I, I is on top of J, J is on top of K, K is on top of L, L is on top of M, M is on top of N, N is on the table.",

    "human_specification": "Two agents are tasked with manipulating blocks arranged in stacks on a table, from one configuration to another. Each block is uniquely labelled by a letter. Both agents can only interact with blocks at the top of each stack, and only interact with one block at a time. Additionally, one agent can only interact with vowel blocks, and the other can only interact with consonant blocks. Initially there are blocks D, A, F, L, K, N, B, H, I, M, G, E, C, J. D is on the table, A is on top of D, F is on top of A, L is on top of F, K is on top of L, N is on top of K, B is on top of N, H is on the table, I is on top of B, M is on top of H, G is on top of M, E is on top of G, C is on top of E, J is on top of C.

PROBLEM
------------------------------
Two agents are tasked with manipulating blocks arranged in stacks on a table, from one configuration to another. Each block is uniquely labelled by a letter. Both agents can only interact with blocks at the top of each stack, and only interact with one block at a time. Additionally, one agent can only interact with vowel blocks, and the other can only interact with consonant blocks. Initially there are blocks C, H, G, F, A, D, O, M, J, B, K, I, L, E, N. C is on the table, H is on the table, G is on top of C, F is on top of G, A is on top of F, D is on top of A, O is on the table, M is on top of D, J is on top of H, B is on top of M, K is on top of B, I is on top of K, L is on top of O, E is on top of I, N is on top of J. The goal is to have A is on top of B, B is on top of C, C is on top of D, D is on top of E, E is on top of F, F is on top of G, G is on top of H, H is on top of I, I is on top of J, J is on top of K, K is on top of L, L is on top of M, M is on top of N, N is on top of O, O is on the table.

You have to orchestrate them to solve the following task: {agents->orchestrator->goal} Keep in mind that the PDDL they send you may be partial or contain ambiguities. A partial PDDL may partially solve a planning problem but may require integration of additional information from the other PDDL to achieve the goal. Ambiguities may appear where two PDDL problems refer to the same object with different names or use different predicates. Here is the information from the first agent: {pddl_vowel_agent} Here is the information from the second agent: {pddl_consonant_agent} You need to integrate the PDDL responses of the two agents to solve the task. It is important that you keep the actions of the two agents distinct and produce a combined domain and problem suitable for FastDownward.

Both agents can only interact with blocks at the top of each stack, and only interact with one block at a time. Additionally, one agent can only interact with vowel blocks, and the other can only interact with consonant blocks. Initially there are blocks C, H, G, F, A, D, O, M, J, B, K, I, L, E, N. C is on the table, H is on the table, G is on top of C, F is on top of G, A is on top of F, D is on top of A, O is on the table, M is on top of D, J is on top of H, B is on top of M, K is on top of B, I is on top of K, L is on top of O, E is on top of I, N is on top of J. The goal is to have A is on top of B, B is on top of C, C is on top of D, D is on top of E, E is on top of F, F is on top of G, G is on top of H, H is on top of I, I is on top of J, J is on top of K, K is on top of L, L is on top of M, M is on top of N, N is on top of O, O is on the table.",

C is on the table, H is on the table, G is on top of C, F is on top of G, A is on top of F, D is on top of A, O is on the table, M is on top of D, J is on top of H, B is on top of M, K is on top of B, I is on top of K, L is on top of O, E is on top of I, N is on top of J.

    "human_specification": "Two agents are tasked with manipulating blocks arranged in stacks on a table, from one configuration to another. Each block is uniquely labelled by a letter. Both agents can only interact with blocks at the top of each stack, and only interact with one block at a time. Additionally, one agent can only interact with vowel blocks, and the other can only interact with consonant blocks. Initially there are blocks C, H, G, F, A, D, O, M, J, B, K, I, L, E, N. C is on the table, H is on the table, G is on top of C, F is on top of G, A is on top of F, D is on top of A, O is on the table, M is on top of D, J is on top of H, B is on top of M, K is on top of B, I is on top of K, L is on top of O, E is on top of I, N is on top of J. The goal is to have A is on top of B, B is on top of C, C is on top of D, D is on top of E, E is on top of F, F is on top of G, G is on top of H, H is on top of I, I is on top of J, J is on top of K, K is on top of L, L is on top of M, M is on top of N, N is on top of O, O is on the table.",

Both agents can only interact with blocks at the top of each stack, and only interact with one block at a time. Additionally, one agent can only interact with vowel blocks, and the other can only interact with consonant blocks. Initially there are blocks C, H, G, F, A, D, O, M, J, B, K, I, L, E, N. C is on the table, H is on the table, G is on top of C, F is on top of G, A is on top of F, D is on top of A, O is on the table, M is on top of D, J is on top of H, B is on top of M, K is on top of B, I is on top of K, L is on top of O, E is on top of I, N is on top of J. The goal is to have A is on top of B, B is on top of C, C is on top of D, D is on top of E, E is on top of F, F is on top of G, G is on top of H, H is on top of I, I is on top of J, J is on top of K, K is on top of L, L is on top of M, M is on top of N, N is on top of O, O is on the table.",

================================================================================

PROBLEM
------------------------------
Two agents are tasked with manipulating blocks arranged in stacks on a table, from one configuration to another. Each block is uniquely labelled by a letter. Both agents can only interact with blocks at the top of each stack, and only interact with one block at a time. Additionally, one agent can only interact with vowel blocks, and the other can only interact with consonant blocks. Initially there are blocks J, K, G, A, F, E, B, D, C, H, I. J is on the table, K is on top of J, G is on top of K, A is on top of G, F is on top of A, E is on the table, B is on top of F, D is on top of B, C is on top of D, H is on top of E, I is on top of H. The goal is to have A is on top of B, B is on top of C, C is on top of D, D is on top of E, E is on top of F, F is on top of G, G is on top of H, H is on top of I, I is on top of J, J is on top of K, K is on the table.

Both agents can only interact with blocks at the top of each stack, and only interact with one block at a time. Additionally, one agent can only interact with vowel blocks, and the other can only interact with consonant blocks. Initially there are blocks J, K, G, A, F, E, B, D, C, H, I. J is on the table, K is on top of J, G is on top of K, A is on top of G, F is on top of A, E is on the table, B is on top of F, D is on top of B, C is on top of D, H is on top of E, I is on top of H.

    "human_specification": "Two agents are tasked with manipulating blocks arranged in stacks on a table, from one configuration to another. Each block is uniquely labelled by a letter. Both agents can only interact with blocks at the top of each stack, and only interact with one block at a time. Additionally, one agent can only interact with vowel blocks, and the other can only interact with consonant blocks. Initially there are blocks J, K, G, A, F, E, B, D, C, H, I. J is on the table, K is on top of J, G is on top of K, A is on top of G, F is on top of A, E is on the table, B is on top of F, D is on top of B, C is on top of D, H is on top of E, I is on top of H. The goal is to have A is on top of B, B is on top of C, C is on top of D, D is on top of E, E is on top of F, F is on top of G, G is on top of H, H is on top of I, I is on top of J, J is on top of K, K is on the table.",

Both agents can only interact with blocks at the top of each stack, and only interact with one block at a time. Additionally, one agent can only interact with vowel blocks, and the other can only interact with consonant blocks. Initially there are blocks J, K, G, A, F, E, B, D, C, H, I. J is on the table, K is on top of J, G is on top of K, A is on top of G, F is on top of A, E is on the table, B is on top of F, D is on top of B, C is on top of D, H is on top of E, I is on top of H.

Both agents can only interact with blocks at the top of each stack, and only interact with one block at a time. Additionally, one agent can only interact with vowel blocks, and the other can only interact with consonant blocks. Initially there are blocks J, K, G, A, F, E, B, D, C, H, I. J is on the table, K is on top of J, G is on top of K, A is on top of G, F is on top of A, E is on the table, B is on top of F, D is on top of B, C is on top of D, H is on top of E, I is on top of H. The goal is to have A is on top of B, B is on top of C, C is on top of D, D is on top of E, E is on top of F, F is on top of G, G is on top of H, H is on top of I, I is on top of J, J is on top of K, K is on the table.",

    "human_specification": "Two agents are tasked with manipulating blocks arranged in stacks on a table, from one configuration to another. Each block is uniquely labelled by a letter. Both agents can only interact with blocks at the top of each stack, and only interact with one block at a time. Additionally, one agent can only interact with vowel blocks, and the other can only interact with consonant blocks. Initially there are blocks J, K, G, A, F, E, B, D, C, H, I. J is on the table, K is on top of J, G is on top of K, A is on top of G, F is on top of A, E is on the table, B is on top of F, D is on top of B, C is on top of D, H is on top of E, I is on top of H. The goal is to have A is on top of B, B is on top of C, C is on top of D, D is on top of E, E is on top of F, F is on top of G, G is on top of H, H is on top of I, I is on top of J, J is on top of K, K is on the table.",

Both agents can only interact with blocks at the top of each stack, and only interact with one block at a time. Additionally, one agent can only interact with vowel blocks, and the other can only interact with consonant blocks. Initially there are blocks J, K, G, A, F, E, B, D, C, H, I. J is on the table, K is on top of J, G is on top of K, A is on top of G, F is on top of A, E is on the table, B is on top of F, D is on top of B, C is on top of D, H is on top of E, I is on top of H. The goal is to have A is on top of B, B is on top of C, C is on top of D, D is on top of E, E is on top of F, F is on top of G, G is on top of H, H is on top of I, I is on top of J, J is on top of K, K is on the table.",

- (consonant-pickup-from-block consonant_agent b c)

Step 51 — t=50.0s
- consonant_agent puts block B down onto the table.
- (consonant-putdown-to-table consonant_agent b)

Step 52 — t=51.0s
- vowel_agent stacks block A onto block B (places A on top of B).
- (vowel-stack-onto vowel_agent a b)

Step 53 — t=52.0s
- consonant_agent picks up block C from the table.
- (consonant-pickup-from-table consonant_agent c)

Step 54 — t=53.0s
- consonant_agent stacks block C onto block D (places C on top of D).
- (consonant-stack-onto consonant_agent c d)

Step 55 — t=54.0s
- vowel_agent picks up block A from on top of B.
- (vowel-pickup-from-block vowel_agent a b)

Step 56 — t=55.0s
- consonant_agent picks up block B from the table.
- (consonant-pickup-from-table consonant_agent b)

Step 57 — t=56.0s
- consonant_agent stacks block B onto block C (places B on top of C).
- (consonant-stack-onto consonant_agent b c)

Step 58 — t=57.0s
- vowel_agent stacks block A onto block B (places A on top of B).
- (vowel-stack-onto vowel_agent a b)

End state (as achieved by these actions):
- Final stacked configuration matches the goal: A on B, B on C, C on D, D on E, E on F, F on G, G on H, H on I, I on J, J on K, and K on the table.

Notes:
- Each step above corresponds exactly to the PDDL action in the given plan; I did not add or remove actions.
- Timestamps assume a simple 1-second duration per action so the plan runs from t=0.0s to t=58.0s (last action ends at t=58.0s). If you prefer different timing (parallel execution, different durations), I can produce an alternative timestamping.

PROBLEM
------------------------------
Two agents are tasked with manipulating blocks arranged in stacks on a table, from one configuration to another. Each block is uniquely labelled by a letter. Both agents can only interact with blocks at the top of each stack, and only interact with one block at a time. Additionally, one agent can only interact with vowel blocks, and the other can only interact with consonant blocks. Initially there are blocks H, D, J, A, E, F, I, G, C, B. H is on the table, D is on top of H, J is on the table, A is on top of D, E is on top of J, F is on top of E, I is on top of F, G is on top of I, C is on top of A, B is on top of G. The goal is to have A is on top of B, B is on top of C, C is on top of D, D is on top of E, E is on top of F, F is on top of G, G is on top of H, H is on top of I, I is on top of J, J is on the table.

Both agents can only interact with blocks at the top of each stack, and only interact with one block at a time. Additionally, one agent can only interact with vowel blocks, and the other can only interact with consonant blocks. Initially there are blocks H, D, J, A, E, F, I, G, C, B. H is on the table, D is on top of H, J is on the table, A is on top of D, E is on top of J, F is on top of E, I is on top of F, G is on top of I, C is on top of A, B is on top of G. The goal is to have A is on top of B, B is on top of C, C is on top of D, D is on top of E, E is on top of F, F is on top of G, G is on top of H, H is on top of I, I is on top of J, J is on the table.",

    "human_specification": "Two agents are tasked with manipulating blocks arranged in stacks on a table, from one configuration to another. Each block is uniquely labelled by a letter. Both agents can only interact with blocks at the top of each stack, and only interact with one block at a time. Additionally, one agent can only interact with vowel blocks, and the other can only interact with consonant blocks. Initially there are blocks H, D, J, A, E, F, I, G, C, B. H is on the table, D is on top of H, J is on the table, A is on top of D, E is on top of J, F is on top of E, I is on top of F, G is on top of I, C is on top of A, B is on top of G. The goal is to have A is on top of B, B is on top of C, C is on top of D, D is on top of E, E is on top of F, F is on top of G, G is on top of H, H is on top of I, I is on top of J, J is on the table.",

Both agents can only interact with blocks at the top of each stack, and only interact with one block at a time. Additionally, one agent can only interact with vowel blocks, and the other can only interact with consonant blocks. Initially there are blocks H, D, J, A, E, F, I, G, C, B. H is on the table, D is on top of H, J is on the table, A is on top of D, E is on top of J, F is on top of E, I is on top of F, G is on top of I, C is on top of A, B is on top of G. The goal is to have A is on top of B, B is on top of C, C is on top of D, D is on top of E, E is on top of F, F is on top of G, G is on top of H, H is on top of I, I is on top of J, J is on the table.",

Ambiguities may appear in different forms for example two PDDL problems may refer to the same object with different names. Here is the information the first agent has and its PDDL response: {pddl_vowel_agent} Here is the information the second agent has and its PDDL response: {pddl_consonant_agent} You need to integrate the PDDL responses of the two agents to solve the task.

Both agents can only interact with blocks at the top of each stack, and only interact with one block at a time. Additionally, one agent can only interact with vowel blocks, and the other can only interact with consonant blocks. Initially there are blocks H, D, J, A, E, F, I, G, C, B. H is on the table, D is on top of H, J is on the table, A is on top of D, E is on top of J, F is on top of E, I is on top of F, G is on top of I, C is on top of A, B is on top of G. The goal is to have A is on top of B, B is on top of C, C is on top of D, D is on top of E, E is on top of F, F is on top of G, G is on top of H, H is on top of I, I is on top of J, J is on the table.",

    "human_specification": "Two agents are tasked with manipulating blocks arranged in stacks on a table, from one configuration to another. Each block is uniquely labelled by a letter. Both agents can only interact with blocks at the top of each stack, and only interact with one block at a time. Additionally, one agent can only interact with vowel blocks, and the other can only interact with consonant blocks. Initially there are blocks H, D, J, A, E, F, I, G, C, B. H is on the table, D is on top of H, J is on the table, A is on top of D, E is on top of J, F is on top of E, I is on top of F, G is on top of I, C is on top of A, B is on top of G. The goal is to have A is on top of B, B is on top of C, C is on top of D, D is on top of E, E is on top of F, F is on top of G, G is on top of H, H is on top of I, I is on top of J, J is on the table.",

NATURAL-PLAN sas_plan_5
------------------------------
Plan summary: 32 actions, each executed sequentially (unit duration). Start time = 0.0, each action duration = 1.0, so step n runs from time (n-1).0 to n.0. All actions follow the given plan exactly and respect agent capabilities (vowel_agent moves vowels A,E,I; consonant_agent moves consonants B,C,D,F,G,H,J).

Step-by-step actions:

1) t=0.0 → 1.0 (duration 1.0) — consonant_agent: Move block B from on top of G to on top of C.
2) t=1.0 → 2.0 — consonant_agent: Move block G from on top of I to the table.
3) t=2.0 → 3.0 — vowel_agent: Move block I from on top of F to the table.
4) t=3.0 → 4.0 — consonant_agent: Move block F from on top of E to on top of G.
5) t=4.0 → 5.0 — vowel_agent: Move block E from on top of J to on top of F.
6) t=5.0 → 6.0 — vowel_agent: Move block I from the table to on top of J.
7) t=6.0 → 7.0 — consonant_agent: Move block B from on top of C to the table.
8) t=7.0 → 8.0 — consonant_agent: Move block C from on top of A to the table.
9) t=8.0 → 9.0 — vowel_agent: Move block A from on top of D to on top of B.
10) t=9.0 → 10.0 — consonant_agent: Move block D from on top of H to on top of E.
11) t=10.0 → 11.0 — consonant_agent: Move block H from the table to on top of I.
12) t=11.0 → 12.0 — consonant_agent: Move block D from on top of E to the table.
13) t=12.0 → 13.0 — consonant_agent: Move block C from the table to on top of D.
14) t=13.0 → 14.0 — vowel_agent: Move block A from on top of B to the table.
15) t=14.0 → 15.0 — consonant_agent: Move block B from the table to on top of C.
16) t=15.0 → 16.0 — vowel_agent: Move block A from the table to on top of B.
17) t=16.0 → 17.0 — vowel_agent: Move block E from on top of F to the table.
18) t=17.0 → 18.0 — consonant_agent: Move block F from on top of G to the table.
19) t=18.0 → 19.0 — vowel_agent: Move block E from the table to on top of F.
20) t=19.0 → 20.0 — consonant_agent: Move block G from the table to on top of H.
21) t=20.0 → 21.0 — vowel_agent: Move block E from on top of F to the table.
22) t=21.0 → 22.0 — consonant_agent: Move block F from the table to on top of G.
23) t=22.0 → 23.0 — vowel_agent: Move block E from the table to on top of F.
24) t=23.0 → 24.0 — vowel_agent: Move block A from on top of B to the table.
25) t=24.0 → 25.0 — consonant_agent: Move block B from on top of C to the table.
26) t=25.0 → 26.0 — vowel_agent: Move block A from the table to on top of B.
27) t=26.0 → 27.0 — consonant_agent: Move block C from on top of D to the table.
28) t=27.0 → 28.0 — consonant_agent: Move block D from the table to on top of E.
29) t=28.0 → 29.0 — consonant_agent: Move block C from the table to on top of D.
30) t=29.0 → 30.0 — vowel_agent: Move block A from on top of B to the table.
31) t=30.0 → 31.0 — consonant_agent: Move block B from the table to on top of C.
32) t=31.0 → 32.0 — vowel_agent: Move block A from the table to on top of B.

Final state (goal achieved): single stack with J on the table, then I, then H, then G, then F, then E, then D, then C, then B, then A on top — exactly the specified target configuration. Total cost: 32 (unit cost per action).
================================================================================

PROBLEM
------------------------------
Two agents are tasked with manipulating blocks arranged in stacks on a table, from one configuration to another. Each block is uniquely labelled by a letter. Both agents can only interact with blocks at the top of each stack, and only interact with one block at a time. Additionally, one agent can only interact with vowel blocks, and the other can only interact with consonant blocks. Initially there are blocks J, A, G, K, F, C, H, D, E, I, B. J is on the table, A is on the table, G is on top of A, K is on top of J, F is on top of K, C is on top of G, H is on top of F, D is on top of H, E is on top of C, I is on top of E, B is on top of I. The goal is to have A is on top of B, B is on top of C, C is on top of D, D is on top of E, E is on top of F, F is on top of G, G is on top of H, H is on top of I, I is on top of J, J is on top of K, K is on the table.

    "human_specification": "Two agents are tasked with manipulating blocks arranged in stacks on a table, from one configuration to another. Each block is uniquely labelled by a letter. Both agents can only interact with blocks at the top of each stack, and only interact with one block at a time. Additionally, one agent can only interact with vowel blocks, and the other can only interact with consonant blocks. Initially there are blocks J, A, G, K, F, C, H, D, E, I, B. J is on the table, A is on the table, G is on top of A, K is on top of J, F is on top of K, C is on top of G, H is on top of F, D is on top of H, E is on top of C, I is on top of E, B is on top of I. The goal is to have A is on top of B, B is on top of C, C is on top of D, D is on top of E, E is on top of F, F is on top of G, G is on top of H, H is on top of I, I is on top of J, J is on top of K, K is on the table.",

Both agents can only interact with blocks at the top of each stack, and only interact with one block at a time. Additionally, one agent can only interact with vowel blocks, and the other can only interact with consonant blocks. Initially there are blocks J, A, G, K, F, C, H, D, E, I, B. J is on the table, A is on the table, G is on top of A, K is on top of J, F is on top of K, C is on top of G, H is on top of F, D is on top of H, E is on top of C, I is on top of E, B is on top of I.

Both agents can only interact with blocks at the top of each stack, and only interact with one block at a time. Additionally, one agent can only interact with vowel blocks, and the other can only interact with consonant blocks. Initially there are blocks J, A, G, K, F, C, H, D, E, I, B. J is on the table, A is on the table, G is on top of A, K is on top of J, F is on top of K, C is on top of G, H is on top of F, D is on top of H, E is on top of C, I is on top of E, B is on top of I.

NATURAL-PLAN sas_plan_3
------------------------------
Below is a readable, step-by-step rendering of the provided PDDL plan. Each step matches the original plan exactly (no actions added/removed), reports the agent performing the action, and gives a timestamp and duration (1.0 time unit per action). I use uppercase block labels (A–K) to match the problem statement. At the end I confirm the final goal is achieved and report the total cost.

Assumptions adhered to: only the top block of a stack is moved; vowel_agent may only move A, E, I, O, U; consonant_agent may only move J, G, K, F, C, H, D, B.

Step 1 — Time 0.0 to 1.0 (duration 1.0)
- Agent: consonant_agent
- Action: move B from on I to the table
- Description: Consonant agent takes block B (top of stack on I) and places it onto the table.
- Result: B is on the table; I becomes clear.

Step 2 — Time 1.0 to 2.0 (duration 1.0)
- Agent: consonant_agent
- Action: move D from on H to on B
- Description: Consonant agent moves block D (top of H) and stacks it onto B.
- Result: D is on B; H becomes clear; B is no longer clear.

Step 3 — Time 2.0 to 3.0 (duration 1.0)
- Agent: consonant_agent
- Action: move H from on F to on I
- Description: Consonant agent takes H (top of F) and places it on I.
- Result: H is on I; F becomes clear; I is no longer clear.

Step 4 — Time 3.0 to 4.0 (duration 1.0)
- Agent: consonant_agent
- Action: move F from on K to on D
- Description: Consonant agent moves F (top of K) and stacks it onto D.
- Result: F is on D; K becomes clear; D is no longer clear.

Step 5 — Time 4.0 to 5.0 (duration 1.0)
- Agent: consonant_agent
- Action: move K from on J to the table
- Description: Consonant agent moves K (top of J) and places it onto the table.
- Result: K is on the table; J becomes clear.

Step 6 — Time 5.0 to 6.0 (duration 1.0)
- Agent: consonant_agent
- Action: move J from table to on K
- Description: Consonant agent picks up J from the table and places it on top of K.
- Result: J is on K; K is no longer clear; J is no longer on the table.

Step 7 — Time 6.0 to 7.0 (duration 1.0)
- Agent: consonant_agent
- Action: move H from on I to on F
- Description: Consonant agent picks up H (currently on I) and stacks it onto F.
- Result: H is on F; I becomes clear; F is no longer clear.

Step 8 — Time 7.0 to 8.0 (duration 1.0)
- Agent: vowel_agent
- Action: move I from on E to on J
- Description: Vowel agent moves I (a vowel block) from E and stacks it onto J.
- Result: I is on J; E becomes clear; J is no longer clear.

Step 9 — Time 8.0 to 9.0 (duration 1.0)
- Agent: consonant_agent
- Action: move H from on F to on I
- Description: Consonant agent moves H (top of F) and places it onto I.
- Result: H is on I; F becomes clear; I is no longer clear.

Step 10 — Time 9.0 to 10.0 (duration 1.0)
- Agent: vowel_agent
- Action: move E from on C to on F
- Description: Vowel agent moves E (a vowel block) from C and stacks it onto F.
- Result: E is on F; C becomes clear; F is no longer clear.

Step 11 — Time 10.0 to 11.0 (duration 1.0)
- Agent: consonant_agent
- Action: move C from on G to on E
- Description: Consonant agent moves C from G and stacks it onto E.
- Result: C is on E; G becomes clear; E is no longer clear.

Step 12 — Time 11.0 to 12.0 (duration 1.0)
- Agent: consonant_agent
- Action: move G from on A to on H
- Description: Consonant agent takes G (on A) and places it on H.
- Result: G is on H; A becomes clear; H is no longer clear.

Step 13 — Time 12.0 to 13.0 (duration 1.0)
- Agent: consonant_agent
- Action: move C from on E to the table
- Description: Consonant agent moves C (top of E) and places it onto the table.
- Result: C is on the table; E becomes clear.

Step 14 — Time 13.0 to 14.0 (duration 1.0)
- Agent: vowel_agent
- Action: move E from on F to on A
- Description: Vowel agent moves E (a vowel block) from F and stacks it onto A.
- Result: E is on A; F becomes clear; A is no longer clear.

Step 15 — Time 14.0 to 15.0 (duration 1.0)
- Agent: consonant_agent
- Action: move F from on D to on G
- Description: Consonant agent moves F (top of D) and places it onto G.
- Result: F is on G; D becomes clear; G is no longer clear.

Step 16 — Time 15.0 to 16.0 (duration 1.0)
- Agent: vowel_agent
- Action: move E from on A to on F
- Description: Vowel agent moves E (a vowel block) from A and stacks it onto F.
- Result: E is on F; A becomes clear; F is no longer clear.

Step 17 — Time 16.0 to 17.0 (duration 1.0)
- Agent: consonant_agent
- Action: move D from on B to on E
- Description: Consonant agent moves D (top of B) and places it onto E.
- Result: D is on E; B becomes clear; E is no longer clear.

Step 18 — Time 17.0 to 18.0 (duration 1.0)
- Agent: consonant_agent
- Action: move C from the table to on D
- Description: Consonant agent picks up C from the table and stacks it onto D.
- Result: C is on D; table position where C sat is now clear.

Step 19 — Time 18.0 to 19.0 (duration 1.0)
- Agent: consonant_agent
- Action: move B from the table to on C
- Description: Consonant agent picks up B from the table and stacks it onto C.
- Result: B is on C; table position where B sat is now clear.

Step 20 — Time 19.0 to 20.0 (duration 1.0)
- Agent: vowel_agent
- Action: move A from the table to on B
- Description: Vowel agent picks up A (a vowel block) from the table and places it on top of B.
- Result: A is on B; the table position where A sat is now clear.

Final state (after Time 20.0)
- The goal is achieved:
  - A on B
  - B on C
  - C on D
  - D on E
  - E on F
  - F on G
  - G on H
  - H on I
  - I on J
  - J on K
  - K on table
- Total plan cost: 20 (20 actions, unit cost each).

Notes:
- Each step follows the agents' constraints: vowel_agent moved only vowel blocks (A, E, I); consonant_agent moved only consonant blocks (B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K).
- Each move involved the top block of its source stack and one block at a time, as required.
