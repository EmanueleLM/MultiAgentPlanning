Below is a human-readable, step-by-step trace of the given plan. Each step corresponds exactly to one action in the plan (no actions added or removed). I report a timestamp and a duration of 1.0s for each step (start time increases by 1.0s per action). Blocks are shown in uppercase for clarity.

Start time = 0.0s. Each step duration = 1.0s.
