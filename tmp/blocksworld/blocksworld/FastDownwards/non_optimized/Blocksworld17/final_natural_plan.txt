Result after Step 38 (t = 38.0)
- The sequence of moves above matches the given plan exactly (38 actions, unit cost each).
- Final achieved configuration (as intended by the plan): A on B, B on C, C on D, D on E, E on F, F on G, G on H, H on I, I on J, J on K, K on L, L on M, M on N, N on O, O on table — i.e., a single stack A on B on C on D on E on F on G on H on I on J on K on L on M on N on O on the table.
- Total plan cost: 38 (unit cost per action), matching the provided plan.

Notes:
- Each step preserves agent permissions (vowel_agent moves vowels A, E, I, O; consonant_agent moves consonants B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, N).
- Each action as listed was executed only when its preconditions (top/clear status and correct agent/block type) were met thanks to prior actions in the sequence.
- Timestamps assume uniform 1.0 time-unit duration per action for readability; if you need actual measured durations, specify per-action timing requirements and I can adjust.
