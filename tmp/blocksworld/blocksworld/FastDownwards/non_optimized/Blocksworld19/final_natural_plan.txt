Below is a step-by-step, human-readable rendering of the provided PDDL plan. I keep the exact order and actions from the plan and report a timestamp for each step (assumed uniform duration of 1.0 s per action). For clarity I use uppercase block names as in the problem file. Note: vowel_agent moves only vowel blocks (A, E, I) and consonant_agent moves only consonant blocks (B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M).

This sequence follows the plan exactly (no actions added or removed) and respects the multi-agent constraints: consonant_agent only moves consonant blocks, vowel_agent only moves vowel blocks, and only top blocks are ever picked. The final goal achieved by this plan is the target stack: A on B on C on D on E on F on G on H on I on J on K on L on M on table.
