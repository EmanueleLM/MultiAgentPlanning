   Human: "consonant_agent moves block J (from H) and puts it onto the table."

4) t=3 → t=4 (duration 1)
   Agent: vowel_agent
   Action: Move I from the table onto J.
   Human: "vowel_agent moves block I (from the table) and places it on top of J."

5) t=4 → t=5 (duration 1)
   Agent: consonant_agent

6) t=5 → t=6 (duration 1)
   Agent: consonant_agent
   Action: Move F from on top of G onto C.
   Human: "consonant_agent moves block F (from G) and places it on top of C."

7) t=6 → t=7 (duration 1)
   Agent: consonant_agent
   Action: Move G from on top of A onto H.
   Human: "consonant_agent moves block G (from A) and places it on top of H."

8) t=7 → t=8 (duration 1)
   Agent: consonant_agent
   Action: Move F from on top of C onto G.
   Human: "consonant_agent moves block F (from C) and places it on top of G."

9) t=8 → t=9 (duration 1)
   Agent: consonant_agent
   Action: Move C from on top of D to the table.
   Human: "consonant_agent moves block C (from D) and puts it onto the table."

10) t=9 → t=10 (duration 1)
    Agent: consonant_agent
    Action: Move D from on top of B onto A.
    Human: "consonant_agent moves block D (from B) and places it on top of A."

11) t=10 → t=11 (duration 1)
    Agent: consonant_agent
    Action: Move B from on top of E onto C.
    Human: "consonant_agent moves block B (from E) and places it on top of C."

12) t=11 → t=12 (duration 1)
    Agent: vowel_agent
    Action: Move E from the table onto F.
    Human: "vowel_agent moves block E (from the table) and places it on top of F."

13) t=12 → t=13 (duration 1)
    Agent: consonant_agent
    Action: Move D from on top of A onto E.
    Human: "consonant_agent moves block D (from A) and places it on top of E."

14) t=13 → t=14 (duration 1)
    Agent: consonant_agent
    Action: Move B from on top of C onto A.
    Human: "consonant_agent moves block B (from C) and places it on top of A."

15) t=14 → t=15 (duration 1)
    Agent: consonant_agent
    Action: Move C from the table onto D.
    Human: "consonant_agent moves block C (from the table) and places it on top of D."

16) t=15 → t=16 (duration 1)
    Agent: consonant_agent
    Action: Move B from on top of A onto C.
    Human: "consonant_agent moves block B (from A) and places it on top of C."

    Agent: vowel_agent
    Action: Move A from the table onto B.
    Human: "vowel_agent moves block A (from the table) and places it on top of B."

Final note: These 17 sequential moves (each 1 time unit) follow the provided plan exactly and result in the target configuration: A on B, B on C, C on D, D on E, E on F, F on G, G on H, H on I, I on J, and J on the table.
