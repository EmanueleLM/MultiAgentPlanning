Assumptions: each action takes 1.0s. Timestamps below start at t=0s and increase by 1s per action. Each step is exactly the corresponding plan action (no additions or deletions). Agents only move blocks they are allowed to (vowel_agent: A, E, I; consonant_agent: B C D F G H J K L). All moves are of top blocks, in accordance with the specification.

1. t=0s (duration 1s) — consonant_agent moves block c from on top of block g to the table.
