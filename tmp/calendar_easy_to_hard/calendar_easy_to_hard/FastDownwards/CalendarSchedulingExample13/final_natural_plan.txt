Summary of executed plan (1 step)

Step 1 — schedule meeting
- Action performed: schedule-meeting at slot s11_30 for participants Diane, Eugene, Jack, and Patricia.
- Day and time: Monday, starting at 11:30.
- Duration: 30 minutes (11:30 — 12:00).
- Effects after this step:
  - The meeting is scheduled (meeting-scheduled = true).
  - The slot s11_30 is reserved for the meeting (scheduled-slot s11_30).
  - The meeting includes Diane, Eugene, Jack, and Patricia (meeting-with Diane, meeting-with Eugene, meeting-with Jack, meeting-with Patricia).
  - Diane, Eugene, Jack and Patricia are no longer free at 11:30 (not free Diane s11_30, etc.).

Notes:
- This single action exactly matches the provided PDDL plan: (schedule-meeting s11_30 diane eugene jack patricia).
- The scheduled time (11:30–12:00) is within the work hours (09:00–17:00) and aligns with the 30‑minute slot granularity, so it satisfies the environment constraints in the specification.
- Observation: the PDDL problem and plan use the participant names Diane, Eugene, Jack, and Patricia. The original JSON specification listed different agent names (Gerald, Roy, Barbara). The action above is faithful to the PDDL plan as given; if you intended the meeting for Gerald, Roy, and Barbara, the PDDL problem would need to be adjusted to use those names.
