Plan (1 step)

Step 1 — schedule-amy s12
- Action: Amy schedules the meeting for Roy, Kathryn, and herself.
- When: Monday, 14:30 — 15:00 (slot s12).
- Duration: 0.5 hours (30 minutes).
- Participants: Roy, Kathryn, Amy.
- Rationale / preconditions satisfied: Monday is active; s12 is free for Roy, Kathryn, and Amy; no meeting was previously scheduled. Amy also prefers s12.
- Effects: the meeting is scheduled in s12, the global goal (meeting-scheduled) is achieved, and s12 is no longer available (not free) for Roy, Kathryn, or Amy.
