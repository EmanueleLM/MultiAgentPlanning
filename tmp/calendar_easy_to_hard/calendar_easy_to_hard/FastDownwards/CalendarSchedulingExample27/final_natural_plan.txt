Step 1 — Orchestrator schedules the meeting (09:00–09:30, Monday; duration 30 minutes)
- Action performed by: orchestrator-agent (the orchestrator)
- Attendees: jesse, kathryn, megan
- Time slot: slot-0900 → Monday 09:00 to 09:30
- Duration: 30 minutes
- Precondition checked: slot-0900 was free and all three participants were available at slot-0900 (jesse: free at 09:00; kathryn: free all day; megan: free at 09:00).
- Effect: slot-0900 is reserved (no longer free), jesse/kathryn/megan are marked as no longer free at that slot, and the meeting is marked as scheduled at slot-0900.
- Outcome: The global goal is achieved — a 30-minute meeting on Monday between 09:00 and 17:00 is scheduled at the earliest slot that fits all participants (09:00–09:30).
