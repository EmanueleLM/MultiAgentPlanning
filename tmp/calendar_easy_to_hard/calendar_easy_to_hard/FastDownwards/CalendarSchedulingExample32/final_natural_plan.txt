Planned actions (following the PDDL plan)

Step 1 — schedule t1600
- PDDL action: (schedule t1600)
- What it does: Schedule the 30‑minute meeting on Monday starting at 16:00 (ends at 16:30).
- Participants: nicole, christine, anna, terry, julie, abigail
- Why valid: every participant is available at t1600 in the problem instance; Anna's preference to avoid meetings before 14:00 is respected (meeting is after 14:00).
- Outcome: meeting-scheduled is true and meeting-at t1600 is set (goal achieved).
