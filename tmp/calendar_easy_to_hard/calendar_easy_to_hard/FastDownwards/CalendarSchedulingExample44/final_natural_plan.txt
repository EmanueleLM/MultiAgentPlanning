Step 1 — schedule-joint-meeting(s8, s9)
- Action: Orchestrator schedules the joint one-hour meeting using slots s8 and s9.
- Time (human): Monday 13:00–14:00 (s8 = 13:00–13:30, s9 = 13:30–14:00). Duration: 60 minutes (two consecutive 30-min slots).
- Participants included: kayla, sandra, ryan, kathleen, walter, arthur, heather.

Why this is valid (availability check):
- Kayla: not busy at 13:00–14:00 (kayla_free includes s8 and s9).
- Sandra: not busy at 13:00–14:00 (sandra_free includes s8 and s9).
- Ryan: not busy at 13:00–14:00 (ryan_free includes s8 and s9, and ryan_unscheduled was true).
- Kathleen: allows meeting starts at s8 (kathleen_startable s8) and was freeforall at s8.
- Walter: free at s8 and s9 (walter_free includes s8 and s9).
- Arthur: free at s8 and s9 (arthur_free includes s8 and s9).
- Heather: startable at s8 and not busy at s8 or s9 (heather_startable s8 and neither s8 nor s9 are listed busy).

Effects applied by this action (what the plan achieves):
- Joint marker: joint_meeting_scheduled = true; joint meeting start = s8 (13:00).
- Each participant’s model updated to reflect the meeting occupying s8 and s9 (their free/occupied predicates updated accordingly), e.g. kayla_scheduled s8, sandra_meeting_at s8, ryan_meeting_scheduled and ryan_scheduled_at s8, kathleen_meeting_scheduled at s8, walter_scheduled, arthur_meeting_start s8 and occupied s8/s9, heather_meeting_at s8 and busy s8/s9.
- Final goal satisfied: a single one-hour meeting slot on Monday (13:00–14:00) that is free for all participants is scheduled.
