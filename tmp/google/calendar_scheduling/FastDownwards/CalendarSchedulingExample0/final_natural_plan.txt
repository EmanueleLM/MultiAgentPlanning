Action 1: Schedule a one-hour meeting for Monday from 12:00 to 13:00 (slot12_13).

- Why this slot: Michelle, Steven, and Jerry are all free in the 12:00–13:00 interval, and there is no existing meeting scheduled yet.
- What happens: The three participants’ availability for 12:00–13:00 is used to hold a single 60-minute meeting.
- Result: The 12:00–13:00 slot is now booked for all three, and a meeting is scheduled. This satisfies the goal of finding a one-hour slot that works for everyone.
