- Action: Alexander schedules a 30-minute meeting at 14:00–14:30 (slot 1400-1430) with Elizabeth and Walter. 
  - Reason: All three are free during 14:00–14:30 on Monday, and this time lies within work hours.
  - Duration: 30 minutes
  - Timestamp: 14:00–14:30 on Monday
  - Expected outcome: The slot 1400-1430 is established as the meeting time for Alexander, Elizabeth, and Walter; the three participants are no longer free in that slot.
