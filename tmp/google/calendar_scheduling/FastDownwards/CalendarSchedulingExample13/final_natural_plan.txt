Step 1: Schedule the 30-minute meeting at 14:00 (2:00 PM) on Monday
- Action: Barbara schedules the meeting with Gerald and Roy for the time slot 14:00-14:30.
- Participants: Gerald, Roy, Barbara.
- Time and duration: 14:00 to 14:30 (30 minutes) on Monday.
- Rationale: All three are available at 14:00; Gerald’s busy windows do not include 14:00-14:30, Barbara is free at 14:00, and Roy is free 09:00-17:00.
- Result: The slot 14:00-14:30 is now scheduled for all three; their calendars reflect that time as occupied.
