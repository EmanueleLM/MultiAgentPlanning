Step 1 — schedule_global_early (t10_00)
- Action performed: Orchestrator schedules the meeting using the "schedule_global_early" action for timeslot t10_00.
- When: Monday, 10:00 — 10:30 (30 minutes).
- Participants: Gerald, Roy, Barbara.
- Why this slot: all three participants are available at 10:00 (the plan’s preconditions were satisfied: free-at for Gerald, Roy and Barbara; slot2 and free2 for Roy; common-available at 10:00; and free3 for Gerald, Roy and Barbara).
- Immediate effects (what this achieves):
  - The meeting is globally scheduled at 10:00 (meeting-scheduled-global; meeting-at-global t10_00).
  - Each agent’s local scheduling markers are set:
    - Agent1 view: meeting-scheduled-agent1 and Gerald/Roy/Barbara no longer free-at t10_00.
    - Agent2 view: scheduled2 t10_00 and meeting-with2 gerald/barbara; free2 roy at t10_00 and common-available t10_00 are consumed.
    - Agent3 view: scheduled3 and meeting-at3 t10_00; free3 gerald/roy/barbara at t10_00 are consumed.
- Note on preferences: this schedules the meeting at an "early" slot (10:00). Although Gerald expressed a preference to avoid meetings before 13:00 in his private information, the integrated model used here allowed the 10:00 slot because all required availability predicates were true; the result is a firm meeting at 10:00–10:30 for all three participants.
