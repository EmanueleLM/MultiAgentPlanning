Step 1: Bradley schedules a 30-minute meeting in the 11:30-12:00 (t11_30) time slot on Monday, with all participants attending (Brandon, Jerry, and Bradley).

- Time window: 11:30 to 12:00 (30 minutes) on Monday.
- Preconditions (as per the plan): Brandon is free at 11:30, Jerry is free at 11:30, Bradley is free at 11:30, and no meeting is already scheduled in this slot.
- Outcome: The 11:30-12:00 slot becomes scheduled; Brandon, Jerry, and Bradley are no longer free for this slot, and the meeting is confirmed.
- Rationale: This single action directly satisfies the plan's action schedule_by_bradley t11_30 and achieves the final goal of having a 30-minute meeting scheduled within the Monday 09:00-17:00 window for all participants.
