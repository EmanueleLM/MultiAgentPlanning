PROBLEM
------------------------------
You are an expert at scheduling meetings. You are given a few constraints on the existing schedule of each participant, the meeting duration, and possibly some preferences on the meeting time. Note there exists a solution that works with existing schedule of every participant. Here are a few example tasks and solutions:

TASK: You need to schedule a meeting for Michelle, Steven and Jerry for one hour between the work hours of 9:00 to 17:00 on Monday. 

Here are the existing schedules for everyone during the day: 
Michelle has meetings on Monday during 11:00 to 12:00; 
Steven has blocked their calendar on Monday during 9:00 to 9:30, 11:30 to 12:00, 13:30 to 14:00, 15:30 to 16:00; 
Jerry has blocked their calendar on Monday during 9:00 to 9:30, 10:00 to 11:00, 11:30 to 12:30, 13:00 to 14:30, 15:30 to 16:00, 16:30 to 17:00; 

Find a time that works for everyone's schedule and constraints.

FINAL-PLAN
------------------------------
Here is a merged, multi-agent PDDL representation that preserves distinct actions for each agent while aiming to schedule a single 60-minute meeting on Monday between 9:00 and 17:00. The plan uses a 15-minute granularity for the hybrid constraints and selects the 14:30–15:30 window as the valid meeting time consistent with the three agents’ information. The final domain includes the three agents’ actions as separate schemas, and the problem initializes all relevant tokens as free so that one of the agent actions can complete the goal.

NATURAL-PLAN sas_plan_5
------------------------------
Action 1: Schedule a one-hour meeting for Monday from 12:00 to 13:00 (slot12_13).

- Why this slot: Michelle, Steven, and Jerry are all free in the 12:00–13:00 interval, and there is no existing meeting scheduled yet.
- What happens: The three participants’ availability for 12:00–13:00 is used to hold a single 60-minute meeting.
- Result: The 12:00–13:00 slot is now booked for all three, and a meeting is scheduled. This satisfies the goal of finding a one-hour slot that works for everyone.
================================================================================

PROBLEM
------------------------------
You are an expert at scheduling meetings. You are given a few constraints on the existing schedule of each participant, the meeting duration, and possibly some preferences on the meeting time. Note there exists a solution that works with existing schedule of every participant. Here are a few example tasks and solutions:

TASK: You need to schedule a meeting for Raymond, Billy and Donald for half an hour between the work hours of 9:00 to 17:00 on Monday. 

Here are the existing schedules for everyone during the day: 
Raymond has blocked their calendar on Monday during 9:00 to 9:30, 11:30 to 12:00, 13:00 to 13:30, 15:00 to 15:30; 
Billy has meetings on Monday during 10:00 to 10:30, 12:00 to 13:00, 16:30 to 17:00; 
Donald has meetings on Monday during 9:00 to 9:30, 10:00 to 11:00, 12:00 to 13:00, 14:00 to 14:30, 16:00 to 17:00; 

Billy would like to avoid more meetings on Monday after 15:00. Find a time that works for everyone's schedule and constraints.

Billy would like to avoid more meetings on Monday after 15:00. Find a time that works for everyone's schedule and constraints. 
SOLUTION: 
================================================================================

FINAL-PLAN
------------------------------
I’m ready to merge the three calendars into a single PDDL domain/problem that finds a common meeting slot within work hours, while keeping each agent’s actions distinct. Please provide the PDDL domain and problem files for Raymond, Billy, and Donald.

What I need from you:
- The PDDL domain and problem for Raymond
- The PDDL domain and problem for Billy
- The PDDL domain and problem for Donald

Optional but helpful details (to improve the merge quality):
- Time zone information for each person (if different)
- Work hours for each person (e.g., 9:00–17:00)
- Desired meeting duration (e.g., 1 hour)
- Time slot granularity (e.g., 30 minutes, 1 hour)
- Any hard constraints (days/tersonal unavailability)
- Any preferences (e.g., “prefer mornings,” “avoid Mondays”)
- Any known existing calendars or list of available/unavailable slots per person

What I’ll produce after you send them:
- A single integrated PDDL domain that includes three distinct agent sections (Raymond, Billy, Donald) with their own actions, all feeding into a common meeting-scheduling goal.
- A corresponding PDDL problem that encodes:
  - The set of discrete time slots (within work hours) as objects
  - Each agent’s availability facts
  - The duration and work-hour constraints
  - The goal: a slot where all three can meet (and optionally a preferred slot if you provide preferences)
- The output will be enclosed in the required tags:
  - <domain> ... integrated domain ... </domain>
  - <problem> ... integrated problem ... </problem>

Paste the domains and problems when you’re ready, and I’ll generate the merged files.

NATURAL-PLAN sas_plan_1
------------------------------
Step 1: Schedule a 30-minute meeting at 9:30 AM on Monday with Billy, Donald, and Raymond.

- Time: 9:30 to 10:00
- Attendees: Billy, Donald, Raymond
- Rationale: All three are not blocked at 9:30 and there is no existing meeting at that time, so the meeting can be scheduled.
================================================================================

PROBLEM
------------------------------
You are an expert at scheduling meetings. You are given a few constraints on the existing schedule of each participant, the meeting duration, and possibly some preferences on the meeting time. Note there exists a solution that works with existing schedule of every participant. Here are a few example tasks and solutions:

TASK: You need to schedule a meeting for Roy, Kathryn and Amy for half an hour between the work hours of 9:00 to 17:00 on Monday. 

Here are the existing schedules for everyone during the day: 
Roy has blocked their calendar on Monday during 9:00 to 9:30, 10:00 to 10:30, 11:00 to 11:30, 12:30 to 13:00; 
Kathryn has meetings on Monday during 9:30 to 10:00, 16:30 to 17:00; 
Amy has blocked their calendar on Monday during 9:00 to 14:30, 15:00 to 16:00, 16:30 to 17:00; 

Amy would rather not meet on Monday after 15:30. Find a time that works for everyone's schedule and constraints.

Amy would rather not meet on Monday after 15:30. Find a time that works for everyone's schedule and constraints. 
SOLUTION: 
================================================================================

FINAL-PLAN
------------------------------
Step-by-step reasoning
- From the three agents, the only overlapping slot that satisfies Amy’s constraint (14:30–15:00) is 14:30–15:00 (14:30-15:00 = t1430).
- This slot is free for Roy, Kathryn, and Amy in their respective inputs, so scheduling all three to this same slot yields a valid plan.
- To orchestrate this in PDDL with distinct actions per agent, I created a unified multi-agent domain with three separate actions:
  - schedule-meeting-roy for Roy
  - schedule-meeting-kathryn for Kathryn
  - schedule-meeting-amy for Amy
- The goal is achieved when all three have been scheduled at the same time slot, specifically t1430 (14:30–15:00).

</problem>

Notes
- The domain uses a single timeSlot domain with three separate agent predicates to reflect each agent's free/scheduled state, and three distinct actions to schedule a meeting for Roy, Kathryn, and Amy respectively.
- The problem is constructed to target the specific slot t1430 (14:30–15:00) to align with Amy’s requirement and to satisfy all three agents’ constraints.

NATURAL-PLAN sas_plan_1
------------------------------
Here is the human-readable execution of the given plan:

- Step 1 (14:30–15:00 on Monday): Schedule Roy for the 14:30 time slot. Roy is now booked for a 30-minute slot starting at 14:30.

- Step 2 (14:30–15:00 on Monday): Schedule Kathryn for the 14:30 time slot. Kathryn is now booked for the same 14:30–15:00 slot.

- Step 3 (14:30–15:00 on Monday): Schedule Amy for the 14:30 time slot. Amy is now booked for the 14:30–15:00 slot.

Result: All three agents (Roy, Kathryn, and Amy) are scheduled for a 30-minute meeting at 14:30–15:00 on Monday. This fulfills the goal of scheduling a half-hour meeting on Monday for Roy, Kathryn, and Amy.
