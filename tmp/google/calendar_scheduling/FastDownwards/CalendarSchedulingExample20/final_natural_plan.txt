Plan (matches PDDL action: (schedule_by_daniel_good slot3))

Step 1 — Daniel schedules the meeting
- Action (from plan): schedule_by_daniel_good slot3
- Human-readable: Daniel schedules the 30-minute meeting with Ralph and Peter on Monday from 10:00 to 10:30.
- Duration / timestamp: 30 minutes — Monday 10:00–10:30 (slot3).
- Preconditions satisfied: Ralph is free at slot3, Peter is free at slot3, Daniel is available at slot3, and slot3 is not marked as undesirable for Daniel.
- Preference respected: Daniel’s preference to avoid meetings after 13:30 is respected (the chosen slot is before 13:30).
- Outcome: The meeting is scheduled at 10:00–10:30 (meeting_scheduled; scheduled_at slot3; unscheduled no longer true).

No other steps are taken. The final goal (a 30-minute meeting on Monday that fits all participants’ constraints and respects preferences when possible) is achieved.
