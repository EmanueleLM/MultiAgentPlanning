Here is the human-readable action that matches the plan and achieves the goal:

- Step 1 (Time: 10:30 to 11:00 on Monday; duration: 60 minutes): Schedule a single 60-minute meeting from 10:30 to 11:00 that all three participants—Theresa, Charles, and Betty—can attend. Preconditions are satisfied because 10:30-11:00 are consecutive 30-minute slots within work hours, and each participant is free during both 10:30 and 11:00. Expected outcome: a meeting is scheduled for 10:30-11:00 with Theresa, Charles, and Betty, satisfying the goal that all participants attend.
