Step 1 (09:00–09:30): Brenda schedules the 30-minute meeting m1 for the time slot 09:00-09:30.

- Rationale: This corresponds to the plan action agent3_schedule_meeting with m1 at t0900_0930. All three participants are free at this slot and no meeting has started yet, so the meeting can be scheduled.
- Result: Meeting m1 starts at 09:00-09:30; Benjamin, Hannah, and Brenda are now blocked for this time slot (i.e., they are reserved and cannot take other meetings then).
