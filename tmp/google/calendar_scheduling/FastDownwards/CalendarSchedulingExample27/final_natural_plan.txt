Step 1 — Orchestrator schedules the meeting (action: schedule-meeting-by-orchestrator orchestrator s1)
- What happens: The orchestrator schedules the 30‑minute meeting in slot s1.
- When: Monday, 09:00–09:30 (s1 = first 30‑minute slot of the work day).
- Who: participants jesse, kathryn, and megan.
- Duration: 30 minutes.
- Resulting state changes:
  - The meeting is marked as scheduled.
  - The meeting is recorded at slot s1 (meeting-at s1).
  - Slot s1 is no longer free for jesse, kathryn, or megan (their calendars now reflect the meeting at 09:00–09:30).
- Why this is valid: s1 was the earliest 30‑minute slot within work hours (09:00–17:00) that was free for all participants, so the orchestrator correctly chose it.
