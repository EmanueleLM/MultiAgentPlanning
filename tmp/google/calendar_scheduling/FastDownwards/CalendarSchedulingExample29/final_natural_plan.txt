Step 1 — schedule-by-diana (t1200, t1230)
- Action: Diana schedules the meeting (PDDL action: schedule-by-diana t1200 t1230).
- When: Monday, from 12:00 to 13:00 (two consecutive 30‑minute slots t1200 and t1230) — total duration 60 minutes.
- Who attends: Madison, Diana, Shirley (all participants).
- Outcome/effects:
  - The meeting is scheduled and marked as starting at 12:00.
  - Madison, Diana, and Shirley are marked as attending.
  - The 12:00–12:30 and 12:30–13:00 slots for each participant are reserved (they are no longer free/available).

This single step meets the goal: a 60‑minute Monday meeting between 09:00 and 17:00 where Madison, Diana, and Shirley are all available (scheduled for 12:00–13:00).
