Step 1: Execute action schedule_meeting_1200_1230
- Time window and duration: 60 minutes starting at 12:00 (12:00–13:00), covering the 12:00 and 12:30 slots.
- Participants: Madison, Diana, and Shirley.
- Rationale: In the initial state, Madison, Diana, and Shirley are free at 12:00 (t1200) and 12:30 (t1230), satisfying the preconditions of schedule_meeting_1200_1230.
- Effect after execution:
  - Madison: not free at t1200 and t1230
  - Diana: not free at t1200 and t1230
  - Shirley: not free at t1200 and t1230
  - Meeting time flag: meeting_at t1200 becomes true
  - Schedule flag: meeting_scheduled becomes true
- Result: A 60-minute meeting is scheduled for the participants Madison, Diana, and Shirley within the Monday work window.
- Cost: 1 (as indicated by the plan)

This single step fulfills the final goal of scheduling the 60-minute meeting with all required participants.
