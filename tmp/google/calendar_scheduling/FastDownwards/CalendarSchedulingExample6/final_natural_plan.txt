Step 1: Schedule a 60-minute meeting at 15:00 (t15) using action schedule-meeting-A2.

- Rationale: Preconditions are satisfied—Dylan, Thomas, and Jerry are all free at t15, and there is no existing meeting at t15.
- Result: A meeting is scheduled at 15:00. Consequently, Dylan, Thomas, and Jerry are no longer free at t15, and meeting-scheduled t15 becomes true. This satisfies the final goal of scheduling the meeting for 60 minutes at 15:00.
