Step 1 — schedule_heather_nonpreferred (t15)
- Actor: Heather (she initiates/schedules the meeting).
- Action: Schedule the 30‑minute meeting in the non‑preferred timeslot t15.
- Timestamp / duration: Monday 16:30–17:00 (30 minutes).
- Attendees: Heather, Nicholas, Zachary.
- Effects / outcome:
  - The meeting is scheduled at 16:30–17:00 on Monday.
  - Heather, Nicholas and Zachary are marked as attending.
  - The timeslot 16:30–17:00 becomes unavailable and each participant is no longer free at that timeslot.
  - This slot is a non‑preferred slot (it falls after 14:00), but it satisfies everyone’s availability and thus achieves the goal.

Final state: A 30‑minute meeting on Monday (16:30–17:00) with Heather, Nicholas and Zachary is scheduled — the goal is satisfied.
