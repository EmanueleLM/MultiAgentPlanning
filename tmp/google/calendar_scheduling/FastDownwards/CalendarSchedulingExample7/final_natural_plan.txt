- Step 1: Heather schedules the 30-minute meeting at 16:30–17:00 (t1630_1700) on Monday. This is possible because Heather, Nicholas, and Zachary are all free at that time and no other meeting is scheduled then.

- Result: The meeting is now scheduled at 16:30–17:00 (meeting_at t1630_1700) for Heather, Nicholas, and Zachary.
