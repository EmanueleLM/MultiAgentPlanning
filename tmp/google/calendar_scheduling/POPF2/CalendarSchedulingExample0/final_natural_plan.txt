To translate the given PDDL plan into a set of human-readable actions, I'll analyze the information and provide a step-by-step meeting scheduling description based on the problem specification and the domain provided.

**Plan for Meeting Scheduling**:

1. **Initialize the Meeting Planning**:
    - **Time Range Considered**: Starting Monday 9:00 and Ending Monday 17:00.
    - **Meeting Duration Requirement**: 60 minutes.
    - **Participants**: Michelle, Steven, and Jerry.
   
2. **Check Personal Availability**:
    - **Michelle's Availability**:
      - Free from 9:00 to 11:00.
      - Free from 12:00 to 17:00.
      - Busy from 11:00 to 12:00.
      
    - **Steven's Availability**:
      - Free from 9:30 to 11:30.
      - Free from 12:00 to 13:30.
      - Free from 14:00 to 15:30.
      - Free from 16:00 to 17:00.
      - Busy during other mentioned slots.
      
    - **Jerry's Availability**:
      - Free from 9:30 to 10:00.
      - Free from 11:00 to 11:30.
      - Free from 12:30 to 13:00.
      - Free from 14:30 to 15:30.
      - Free from 16:00 to 16:30.
      - Busy during other mentioned slots.

3. **Identify Common Available Time Slots**:
    - Analyze time slots within provided time frames for overlaps common to all participants.
    - **Potential Slots**:
        - 12:00 to 13:00 is a suitable slot for all three participants as they are available.

4. **Schedule the Meeting**:
    - **Chosen Time Slot**: 12:00 to 13:00 on Monday.
    - Meeting scheduled at this time as it is the first 60-minute slot where all are available.

5. **Validate the Scheduling**:
    - Confirm the slot verification with all agents indicating that all constraints are met.
    - Slot checked and confirmed: 12:00 to 13:00.

6. **Outcome**:
    - Meeting officially scheduled and acknowledged for Monday from 12:00 to 13:00.
    - No further conflicts or required interactions as all constraints are satisfied.

This completes the task of translating the PDDL actions into human-readable meeting scheduling. By following these steps, we achieve scheduling a one-hour meeting for all involved participants within their available working hours.
