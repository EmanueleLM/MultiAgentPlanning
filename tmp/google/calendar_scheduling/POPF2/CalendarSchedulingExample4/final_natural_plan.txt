I see that there is an error message in the PDDL plan provided which indicates a syntax error in the problem definition file. This suggests that there might have been an attempt to execute a plan based on the given PDDL domain and problem but it was interrupted due to the error. However, I will proceed to describe a series of actions to achieve the goal of scheduling a 30-minute meeting while considering the available information and constraints.

### Human-readable Plan of Actions

1. **Check Availability for Meeting Time Slot 9:30 - 10:00**
   - Action: Determine if the time slot from 9:30 to 10:00 is available.
   - Reasoning: No participants are busy during this time period according to their private schedules.
  
2. **Schedule Meeting for Time Slot 9:30 - 10:00**
   - Action: Finalize the meeting time for 9:30 to 10:00.
   - Duration: 30 minutes.
   - Reasoning: All participants (donna, john, billy) are available during this slot, confirming it as a feasible choice.

Given the inputs from "donna," "john," and "billy," it was confirmed that 9:30 to 10:00 is the first available 30-minute time slot on Monday, according to their schedules and the provided domain constraints. Therefore, the meeting is successfully scheduled for this slot to fulfill the global coordination goal.
