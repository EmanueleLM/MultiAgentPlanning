The PDDL plan provided contains only an indication of a syntax error without listing specific sequential actions. To create a human-readable plan that satisfies the intention of scheduling a 60-minute meeting on Monday among the three participants (Thomas, Dylan, and Jerry), we'll need to deduce a feasible timeline based on their availability.

### Steps to Schedule the Meeting:

#### 1. Examine Thomas's Availability
- Thomas is available all day on Monday from 9:00 to 17:00.
  
#### 2. Examine Dylan's Availability
- Dylan is free on Monday but has specific half-hour slots blocked from 10:30 to 11:00 and 13:30 to 14:00.
  
#### 3. Examine Jerry's Availability
- Jerry is more constrained. His availability on Monday is:
  - 11:00 to 11:30
  - 14:30 to 15:00
  - 15:00 to 15:30
  - 15:30 to 16:00

#### 4. Find Overlapping Free Time for All Participants
- Here is the overlap of available times:
  - 15:00 to 16:00

#### 5. Schedule the Meeting
- Based on the constraining schedules of Dylan and Jerry, the best overlap for a full 60-minute meeting is from 15:00 to 16:00.

### Final Scheduled Meeting:
- **Action:** Schedule a 60-minute meeting.
- **Time:** Monday from 15:00 to 16:00.
- **Participants:** Thomas, Dylan, and Jerry.

All participants can attend the meeting during this time, fulfilling the requirement of scheduling a 60-minute meeting on Monday within the work hours of 9:00 to 17:00. This plan reflects a reasonable interpretation of achieving the goal set forth in the specification, considering all constraints.
