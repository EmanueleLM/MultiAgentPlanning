3. **Schedule Meeting:**
   - Record that the meeting is successfully scheduled for the 09:30 to 10:00 slot on Monday. This slot accommodates all three participants and adheres to their availability and preferences.

4. **Notify Participants:**
   - Communicate to Heather, Nicholas, and Zachary that the meeting is scheduled. All participants are confirmed as attending the meeting at this chosen time.

5. **Conclude Planning:**
