Based on the given PDDL specification, domain, and problem, here is the set of human-readable actions that wouldn't completely match the provided plan due to its errors but outline what a successful scheduling would look like:

1. **Examine Availability**
    - Check the availability of Adam, Jerry, and Matthew at times throughout the day on Monday.
    - Identify all time slots between 09:00 and 17:00 where all three participants are simultaneously available.
    - Available slots are: 
      - 09:00-09:30 for Adam, Jerry, and Matthew is not fully compatible due to incomplete slots.
      - 11:00-11:30.

2. **Verify Possible Meeting Slot**
    - Verify their availability to maintain a minimum meeting duration of 30 minutes during a single time slot.
    - Optimal check at time slot: 
      - 11:00-11:30, where more participants are noted to be free.
  
3. **Schedule the Meeting**
    - Schedule a 30-minute meeting starting at 11:00 on Monday.
    - Confirm that none of the participants, Adam, Jerry, or Matthew, have conflicts during 11:00 to 11:30.
    - All participants have confirmed attendance; the meeting can be definitively scheduled.

4. **Finalize the Meeting Time**
    - Conclude with the time slot 11:00-11:30 as the agreed meeting time.
    - Set the meeting notification and send out calendar invitations.
    
This plan effectively integrates available schedules and selects a time that fits everyone without encountering syntax or planning errors as specified in the problematic provided plan.
