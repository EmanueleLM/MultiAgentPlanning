PROBLEM
------------------------------
You are visiting San Francisco for the day and want to meet as many friends as possible. Solve the problem by considering various different schedules and picking the best one to optimize your goals.

Travel distances (in minutes):
Marina District to Mission District: 20.
Mission District to Marina District: 19.

CONSTRAINTS: You arrive at Marina District at 9:00AM. Stephanie will be at Mission District from 10:30AM to 1:30PM. You'd like to meet Stephanie for a minimum of 120 minutes.

Your response should start with 'SOLUTION:'.

FINAL-PLAN
------------------------------
Based on the information from both agents, we will merge and refine the original domains and problems into a single PDDL domain and problem. We need to keep their actions distinct, manage time constraints effectively, and ensure that meetings can occur based on overlapping availability. Here's how we can combine these PDDL descriptions:

<domain>
```lisp
(define (domain coordinated-meeting)
  (:requirements :strips :typing)

  (:predicates
    ;; Location predicates
    (at ?p - person ?l - location)
    
    ;; Availability and meeting predicates
    (available ?p - person ?t - time)
    (met ?p1 - person ?p2 - person)

    ;; Time predicates
    (time ?t - time)
  )
  
  ;; Actions for person "you"
  (:action travel-you

    :precondition (and

    )
    :effect (and

  )

  (:action meet-you

      (at ?p1 ?loc)
      (at ?p2 ?loc)
      (available ?p1 ?start)
      (available ?p2 ?end)
      (time ?start)
      (time ?end)
      (>= (- ?end ?start) 120) ; Ensure meeting duration is at least 120 minutes
    )
    :effect (met ?p1 ?p2)
  )

  ;; Actions for person "stephanie"
  (:action travel-stephanie
    :parameters (?p - person ?from - location ?to - location ?travel_time - time)
    :precondition (and
      (at ?p ?from)
      (time ?travel_time)

    :effect (and

      (>= (- ?end ?start) 120) ; Ensure meeting duration is at least 120 minutes
    )
    :effect (met ?p1 ?p2)

)
```
</domain>

```lisp

    (available you time1300)

    ;; Assume travel times can fit current intervals
  )
  
  (:goal
    (met you stephanie)
  )

```
</problem>

### Explanation

1. **Domain and Problem**: This combined PDDL domain captures actions for two people ("you" and "Stephanie") to travel and meet, ensuring each action is kept distinct but allowing coordination.

2. **Time and Location Constraints**: Time is represented with predefined intervals with predicates to address availability and the meeting time constraint of at least 120 minutes.

3. **Goal**: The structured goal is for "you" and "Stephanie" to meet, factoring in the meeting duration requirement.

This combined format meshes both agents’ knowledge, allowing FastDownward to solve the problem, respecting distinct actions and task agreements.
