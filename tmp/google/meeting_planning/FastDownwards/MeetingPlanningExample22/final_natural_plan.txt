Summary of timestamps used
- t540 = 9:00 AM
- t675 = 11:15 AM
- t780 = 1:00 PM (13:00)
- Duration t540 -> t675 = 135 minutes
- Duration t675 -> t780 = 105 minutes

Planned actions (follow the plan exactly)

1) wait_until_1115 (t540 → t675)
- What happens: Wait until 11:15 AM.
- Who/where: Implicit wait from the initial time (visitor is at Presidio at 9:00 AM).
- Time: From 9:00 AM (t540) to 11:15 AM (t675).
- Duration: 135 minutes.

2) meet_for_105 (andrew, andrew, t675 → t780)
- What happens: A 105‑minute meeting starting at 11:15 AM and ending at 1:00 PM.
- Participants (as in the plan): Andrew and Andrew (both parameters are andrew).
- Time: From 11:15 AM (t675) to 1:00 PM (t780).
- Duration: 105 minutes.
- Effect: The PDDL goal predicate met becomes true (goal achieved).

Plan cost: 2 actions

Note / important caveat
- The plan above follows the given PDDL plan exactly. Formally it achieves the problem goal (the predicate met) by scheduling a 105‑minute meeting parameterized as (andrew, andrew). This means, as written, the meeting in the plan involves Andrew with himself; the visitor never moves to Union Square in this plan. If the real-world intent is that the visitor meets Andrew for 105 minutes, the plan does not actually have the visitor present and would need an additional travel/action (e.g., visitor travels to Union Square) to reflect that intent.
