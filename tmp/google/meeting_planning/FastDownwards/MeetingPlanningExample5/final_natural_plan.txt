Here is a human-readable rendering of the two actions from the plan, with time stamps and durations inferred from the domain and problem data.

1) Travel from NobHill to TheCastro for visitor
- Action: travel-nobToCastro(visitor)
- Time window: 09:00 to 09:17 (travel time = 17 minutes)
- Rationale: The visitor starts at NobHill at 09:00 and the travel action moves the visitor to TheCastro in 17 minutes.
- Resulting state: visitor is at TheCastro.

2) Meet William at TheCastro
- Action: meet-william
- Start time: 09:17 (immediately after arriving)
- Participants: visitor and william are both at TheCastro
- Duration: at least 75 minutes (to satisfy the visitor’s objective of a minimum 75-minute meeting)
- Rationale: The plan’s second step is to meet William at TheCastro; William is available there in the plan’s context, so the meeting can begin right away and be extended to meet the 75-minute objective.
- Resulting state: visitor and william have met.

Plan cost note:
- Total plan cost: 2 (unit cost), corresponding to the two actions above.

Final outcome:
- The visitor and William meet at TheCastro, satisfying the goal of meeting William.
