FINAL-PLAN
------------------------------
I don't yet have the two agents' PDDL inputs you mentioned. Below I provide:
- a reusable orchestrator domain that is ready to integrate two agents (actions namespaced as required),
- a small example problem instance (so the files are immediately usable in FastDownward),
- and a short note on how to give me the two agents' domains/problems so I can produce a merged instance from their real inputs.

When you provide the agents' PDDL domain/problem pairs, I will:
1. Resolve object-name mismatches,
2. Merge travel-time, availability windows and meeting-duration information,
3. Namespace each agent's actions (as in the template below),
4. Produce a combined domain + problem that enforces meeting constraints and minimizes the visitor objective (I will use the visitor-travel numeric fluent as the objective, unless you specify a different visitor).

Below are the orchestrator domain and an example problem. Replace the example problem's initializations with the data from the two agent inputs (locations, travel times, availability windows, meeting duration, visitor identity), or send me the agent files and I'll integrate them.

</problem>

Notes and next steps:
- If you want me to integrate two provided agent domains/problems, send both full domain and problem files (or paste them). I'll:
  - map equivalent object names (locations, agent names),
  - merge travel-time tables and unify meeting-duration,
  - create a combined orchestrator domain (like above) but with the agents' actual action names namespaced,
  - produce a final problem with unified objects, availability windows, accurate travel-time entries and the metric that optimizes the visitor objective you want.
- Tell me which agent is the "visitor" (whose travel we should minimize) if it differs from the a1 sample above.
- If you prefer using durative actions or an explicit temporal planner interface instead of numeric time-increment modeling, say so and provide the agent files — I will produce durative-action based PDDL suitable for temporal planners.

NATURAL-PLAN sas_plan_4
------------------------------
1) Orchestrator starts the meeting between the two participants at The Castro, from 12:15 to 13:30 (duration 75 minutes).
   - PDDL action matched: orchestrator_start_meeting a1 a1 loca t0 t2
   - Interpreting the plan items in the problem/specification:
     - a1 → visitor, loca → The Castro, t0 → 12:15, t2 → 13:30
   - Effects (what this step accomplishes):
     - The meeting is started and runs from 12:15 to 13:30 (75 minutes).
     - The meeting-done goal is achieved (meeting completed).
     - The current time advances to 13:30.

This single action exactly follows the provided plan and satisfies the specification requirement that the visitor meets William for at least 75 minutes at The Castro.

NATURAL-PLAN sas_plan_1
------------------------------
Below is a step-by-step, human-readable translation of the provided PDDL plan. Each step corresponds to exactly one action in the plan, in the same order. For travel actions I show departure time (t-index and clock time), arrival time, and duration (always 11 minutes). For wait actions I show the one-minute wait interval. For the meeting I show the meeting start and end times and total duration (90 minutes).

Time conversion rule used: tN = 9:00 AM + N minutes. (So t0 = 09:00, t11 = 09:11, etc.)

265. The meeting begins: meeting spans 90 consecutive minutes starting at t319 (14:19).
    - Meeting start: t319 = 14:19
    - Meeting end: t409 = 15:49
    - Duration: 90 minutes
    - During the meeting both Visitor and Kenneth are at Nob Hill for every minute from t319 through t408 (the plan's meeting action parameters represent minute-by-minute presence t319..t408 and end state at t409).
266. (End state) The plan reports total cost = 1376 (this is the numeric plan cost computed by the PDDL plan).

Notes and mapping reminders:
- All travel actions are 11-minute trips between Fisherman's Wharf and Nob Hill (succ11 edges).
- All wait actions are single-minute waits (succ1 edges).
- The crucial meeting is scheduled to start at t319 (14:19) and runs for 90 minutes, finishing at t409 (15:49), satisfying the requirement of at least 90 minutes together while respecting Kenny's availability window (which allowed meeting starts at or after t315 / 14:15 and finishing by t645 / 19:45).
- The order above follows the plan exactly; every action in the provided plan is represented in sequence. For many late-plan steps that are repeated one-minute waits, each is listed as an individual one-minute wait step to reflect the planner's minute-by-minute encoding.

NATURAL-PLAN sas_plan_1
------------------------------
1) traveler-travel-chinatown-to-marina (t540 → t552, meeting end t657)
- Action: Traveler leaves Chinatown and goes to Marina.
- Departs Chinatown at 09:00 (t540).
- Travel time: 12 minutes (09:00 → 09:12).
- Arrives at Marina at 09:12 (t552). The travel action also reserves the traveler's presence at Marina through t657.

2) meet-at-marina (t552 → t657)
- Action: Traveler and Stephanie meet at Marina.
- Meeting interval: 09:12 (t552) to 10:57 (t657).
- Duration: 105 minutes (meets the required minimum).
- Effect: Stephanie and the traveler are recorded as having met.

Result: The goal "met stephanie traveler" is satisfied (meeting held at Marina from 09:12 to 10:57).
