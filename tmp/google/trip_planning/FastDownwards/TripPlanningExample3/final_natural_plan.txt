Here is a human-readable, step-by-step rendering of the given PDDL plan. Each step corresponds exactly to one action in the plan (same order, same parameters). For every step I indicate the day transition (timestamp/duration = 1 day when moving from dayX to dayY).

1) Action: (flight_fly berlin warsaw day1 day2)
   - Description: Fly from Berlin to Warsaw, moving from day1 to day2.
   - Timestamp / duration: day1 → day2 (1 day)

2) Action: (flight_stay berlin day1 day2)
   - Description: Stay in Berlin, advancing from day1 to day2.
   - Timestamp / duration: day1 → day2 (1 day)

3) Action: (flight_stay berlin day2 day3)
   - Description: Stay in Berlin, advancing from day2 to day3.
   - Timestamp / duration: day2 → day3 (1 day)

4) Action: (flight_fly berlin warsaw day3 day4)
   - Description: Fly from Berlin to Warsaw, moving from day3 to day4.
   - Timestamp / duration: day3 → day4 (1 day)

5) Action: (flight_fly warsaw bucharest day4 day5)
   - Description: Fly from Warsaw to Bucharest, moving from day4 to day5.
   - Timestamp / duration: day4 → day5 (1 day)

6) Action: (flight_stay warsaw day4 day5)
   - Description: Stay in Warsaw, advancing from day4 to day5.
   - Timestamp / duration: day4 → day5 (1 day)

7) Action: (meet_friend_day5)
   - Description: Meet the friend in Bucharest on day5.
   - Timestamp / duration: occurs at day5

8) Action: (flight_fly warsaw bucharest day5 day6)
   - Description: Fly from Warsaw to Bucharest, moving from day5 to day6.
   - Timestamp / duration: day5 → day6 (1 day)

9) Action: (flight_stay warsaw day5 day6)
   - Description: Stay in Warsaw, advancing from day5 to day6.
   - Timestamp / duration: day5 → day6 (1 day)

Cost note from plan: total cost = 9 (unit cost).

Final result (as intended by this plan):
- Visits recorded for Berlin, Warsaw, and Bucharest across the 6-day trip as planned.
- Meeting with the friend occurs on day5 (meet_friend_day5).
- The sequence above exactly matches the provided PDDL plan actions and timestamps.
